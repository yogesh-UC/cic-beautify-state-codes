Acts ch. 92 was passed last by the General Assembly and, ordinarily, any provisions in ch. 92 which conflict with provisions in ch. 89, the earlier-passed bill, would prevail under the authority of KRS 446.250. However, new language added in ch. 92 has not been incorporated into KRS 11.200 because to make such change would make the section unintelligible. KRS 7.136(3) provides that if a statute is amended by more than one act in the same session of the General Assembly, that the change shall be given effect and incorporated only if the change will make the section intelligible.</p>

<p class="p9">The General Assembly declares it to be the purpose of KRS 11.210 to 11.260 to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a governor and the inauguration of a new governor. The interest of the Commonwealth requires that such transitions be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the Commonwealth and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in KRS 11.210 to 11.260 directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all officers of the state government so conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as to be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of Governor, to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power and otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of Governor.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993. OAG 93-25.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the state lottery is not a “business” as that term is used in subsection (1) of this section and does not engage in business for profit in any normal sense of the words and has no owners or stockholders who have a personal financial stake in its earnings, employment with the state lottery is not affected by the provisions of KRS 11A.040.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Governor may under KRS 12.025 (repealed) reorganize by executive order the Department of Agriculture, which is administered by a constitutional officer, until the General Assembly reconvenes since the Department of Agriculture is clearly a department for Chapter 12 purposes under this section, since the General Assembly has not specifically exempted a department headed by an elected official from the KRS 12.025 (repealed) reorganization powers of the Governor, as was done with certain other departments, and since the Governor in the absence of the General Assembly can prescribe through executive order the duties and responsibilities of the Commissioner of Agriculture under Ky. Const., § 91 and Ky. Const., § 93; however, the Governor cannot strip a constitutional officer of all duties under KRS 12.025 (repealed) and leave an empty shell for him to administer since the General Assembly could not do this while it was in session.

The interim joint legislative committee to which it is referred shall review the plan to determine whether the plan can reasonably be expected to achieve greater economy, efficiency or improved administration in state government.

The subject matter of each executive order relating to reorganization shall be presented to the General Assembly in a separate bill. If the General Assembly fails to enact the temporary reorganization plan or an alternative to such plan, the organizational structure that existed immediately prior to the implementation of the temporary plan shall be reinstated upon the termination of the temporary plan. If the General Assembly fails to enact a temporary reorganization plan, the Governor, the Kentucky Economic Development Partnership as created in KRS 154.10-010, and other elected state executive officers shall not effect the plan prior to the next succeeding session of the General Assembly.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a dispute over the use of a hearing officer from the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General (OAG), KRS 12.100 did not apply because the opinion of the OAG hearing officer was not an opinion of the OAG; rather, it was a quasi-judicial opinion rendered as part of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Transportation Cabinet, Department of Vehicle Regulation’s administrative hearing process and was an opinion of the Cabinet. The dispute in this case actually involved a conflict between two statutes; therefore, the conflict did not have to be resolved by the Governor’s office. Commonwealth v.

<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The General Assembly recognizes that persons with disabilities who receive the services and support, directly or indirectly, are often not consulted for their perspectives, nor are their viewpoints sought regarding the efficiency, strengths, or weaknesses of the services and support.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a federal act and its regulations provide for a procedure by which an accused strip miner is given a formal hearing, with a full record, rights of examination, cross-examination, subpoenas, etc., and where from this full hearing there is an appeal to an administrative law judge and ultimately to the federal court system, by not providing a similar proceeding, the parallel Kentucky regulations are more stringent than the federal law and regulations, in violation of subsection (1) of this section, thus making former 405 KAR 7:090(4), which provided for a formal hearing only upon prepayment of assessed penalties, null, void and unenforceable. Franklin v. Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Protection Cabinet, 799 S.W.2d 1, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 75 (Ky. 1990).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS Chapter 281A did not set forth a comprehensive scheme of regulating the same matter which was being regulated by an administrative agency in violation of this section, as the administrative regulation was more detailed, comprehensive and pertinent regarding school bus drivers than was the statute, which dealt with commercial driver’s licenses. Cornette v. Commonwealth, 899 S.W.2d 502, 1995 Ky. App. LEXIS 108 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judgment of the trial court affirming the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Energy and Environment Cabinet’s (Cabinet) imposition of restrictive conditions on all future mining in the area was reversed where 405 KAR 24:030 § 8(3) was contrary to law, KRS 350.610, and more stringent than the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C.S. § 1201 et seq., thereby rendering it null, void and unenforceable; the Cabinet refused to make a finding of unsuitability yet imposed restrictive conditions consistent with an unsuitability determination. Laurel Mt. Res., LLC v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 791, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 34 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Physician’s discipline based on the suspension of the physician’s license in another state was improper because the regulation applied by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure (KBML) invalidly exceeded the KBML’s statutory authority, as the regulation required the KBML to impose the same discipline as that imposed by another state, while the statute granted the KBML discretion to determine the appropriate sanction.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Department of Corrections was required by Kentucky law to promulgate a regulation as to all portions of the lethal injection protocol, KRS 431.220, as the “private rights” of those individuals being executed by the Commonwealth were invariably affected by the manner in which the lethal injection was administered; the Department was not prohibited from adopting regulations to implement the death penalty through lethal injection simply because KRS 431.220 contained no express reference to the adoption of regulations.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition in 201 KAR 23:130(1) (now (2)), which limited the interpretation of philanthropic and nonprofit field service offices to only those agencies which operate on a national or regional basis, went beyond the statutory authority granted to the Board of Examiners of Social Work by the General Assembly.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A warden’s memorandum to staff and inmates clarifying that canteen receipts for perishable items were to be retained for 60 days in order to avoid confiscation thereof was a reasonable “housekeeping” measure that did not alter the policies collected under 501 KAR 6:020, did not violate KRS 13A.130, and complied with both statutory and administrative law; the memorandum was reasonably related to penological objectives of minimizing hoarding, bartering, and gambling and was within the Department of Corrections authority pursuant to KRS 196.030(1)(a).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though Kentucky did not recognize promises made by administrative agencies under KRS 13A.130, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was entitled to rely on a commitment letter issued by the state cabinet because the focus was not on the state regulation itself pertaining to antidegradation rules but rather the process that the EPA used to approve the regulations. The EPA used the letter as an interpretation of the cabinet to help its understanding in conducting its approval process, which was not an arbitrary and capricious action. Ky. Waterways Alliance v.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> When promulgating administrative regulations and reviewing existing ones, administrative bodies shall, whenever possible, tier their administrative regulations to reduce disproportionate impacts on certain classes of regulated entities, including government or small business, or both, and to avoid regulating entities that do not contribute significantly to the problem the administrative regulation was designed to address. The tiers, however, shall be based upon reasonable criteria and uniformly applied to an entire class. Administrative bodies shall use any number of tiers that will solve most efficiently and effectively the problem the administrative regulation addresses. A written statement shall be submitted to the Legislative Research Commission explaining why tiering was or was not used.</p>

The hearing officer shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts of this Commonwealth. Hearsay evidence may be admissible, if it is the type of evidence that reasonable and prudent persons would rely on in their daily affairs, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support an agency’s findings of facts unless it would be admissible over objections in civil actions.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form if doing so will expedite the hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any party. The hearing officer may make a recommended order in an administrative hearing submitted in written form if the hearing officer determines there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Any party shall have the right to inspect, at least five (5) days prior to the hearing, a list of all witnesses every other party expects to call at the hearing, and the available documentary or tangible evidence relating to an administrative hearing either in person or by counsel. Copies of documentary evidence may be obtained upon the payment of a fee, except documents protected from disclosure by state or federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as giving a party the right to examine or copy the personal notes, observations, or conclusions of the agency staff, unless exculpatory in nature, nor shall it be construed as allowing access to the work product of counsel for the agency. Conditions for examining and copying agency records, fees to be charged, and other matters pertaining to access to these records shall be governed by KRS 61.870 to 61.884. To the extent required by due process, the hearing officer may order the inspection of any records excluded from the application of KRS 61.870 to 61.884 under KRS 61.878 that relate to an act, transaction, or event that is a subject of the hearing, and may order their inclusion in the record under seal.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> Objections to evidentiary offers may be made by any party and shall be noted in the record.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> The hearing officer may take official notice of facts which are not in dispute, or of generally-recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency’s specialized knowledge. The hearing officer shall notify all parties, either before or during the hearing, or in preliminary reports or otherwise, of any facts so noticed and their source. All parties shall be given an opportunity to contest facts officially noticed.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> The agency shall cause all testimony, motions, and objections in a hearing to be accurately and completely recorded. Any person, upon request, may receive a copy of the recording or a copy of the transcript, if the hearing has been transcribed, at the discretion of the agency, unless the hearing is closed by law. The agency may prepare a transcript of a hearing or a portion of a hearing upon request but the party making the request shall be responsible for the transcription costs. The form of all requests and fees charged shall be consistent with KRS 61.870 to 61.884.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> In all administrative hearings, unless otherwise provided by statute or federal law, the party proposing the agency take action or grant a benefit has the burden to show the propriety of the agency action or entitlement to the benefit sought. The agency has the burden to show the propriety of a penalty imposed or the removal of a benefit previously granted. The party asserting an affirmative defense has the burden to establish that defense. The party with the burden of proof on any issue has the burden of going forward and the ultimate burden of persuasion as to that issue. The ultimate burden of persuasion in all administrative hearings is met by a preponderance of evidence in the record, except when a higher standard of proof is required by law. Failure to meet the burden of proof is grounds for a recommended order from the hearing officer.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fire district chiefs had the burden of proving that they were entitled to time-and-a-half overtime pay pursuant to KRS 337.285 because proof that a claimant was an employee was part of their prima facie case for entitlement to overtime pay, not an affirmative defense for which the city employer bore the burden of proof. City of Louisville, Div. of Fire v. Fire Serv. Managers Ass'n by &amp; Through Kaelin, 212 S.W.3d 89, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 296 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had to determine whether the combined effects of the employee’s impairments rendered him unable to return to his former position or like positions, and the appellate court found that KRS 61.600(3)(d) referred to medically and psychiatrically diagnosable maladies only; a claimant bore the burden to come forward with some evidence that his condition did not preexist his service with the Commonwealth, and upon such a threshold showing, the burden of going forward shifted back to the Kentucky Retirement Systems, and smoking could not be considered a preexisting condition.

While the ultimate burden of persuasion is not moved from the party upon which it was originally cast (the claimant), the systems must come forward with some evidence in rebuttal where a claimant makes a threshold showing that his or her condition was not preexisting, and, while the fact-finder is free to accept or reject any evidence it chooses, it is not free to reject uncontested evidence; therefore, the fact-finder was not free to reject the unrebutted testimony of a doctor relating to the fact that it was highly unlikely that an employee had experienced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the year of his re-employment, despite his smoking.

The hearing officer had to make such a finding in the first instance, pursuant to KRS 13B.090(1) and KRS 13B110(1), which the Board was then to review pursuant to KRS 13B.120(2) and (3), followed by the trial court’s review and, then, review by the appellate court under KRS 13B.150(2).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly set aside a final order by the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Service because the Cabinet acted in excess of its statutory authority by freezing a mental health provider's reimbursement rates for seven years without reference to its actual costs and failed to set forth sufficient findings to explain the deviation from the hearing officer's recommended findings concerning the amount which the provider was owed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13B.120, the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure is to consider the record, including the hearing officer's recommended order, any witness or expert testimony, exceptions filed by the parties, and the original grievances initiating the investigation, and determine whether substantial evidence supports revoking a physician's medical license.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Physician's argument that the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure did not consider the record in revoking his license was rejected where he had not articulated how any evidence in the record contradicted the hearing officer's findings or the evidence presented at the administrative hearing.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In reading KRS 15.200 and KRS 15.020 with consistency, the Kentucky Court of Appeals believes that, when the General Assembly enacted KRS 15.020, the Kentucky Attorney General did not have the common law power to investigate and prosecute cases at will, nor was the enactment of KRS 15.020 a grant of such a power; however, the subsequent enactment of KRS 15.200 is a specific grant of authority to the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute cases in limited circumstances. Accordingly, the Attorney General’s power and authority to investigate and prosecute cases is defined by KRS 15.200. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 10 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2012 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions herein repeal by implication the residential requirements of KRS 61.300(1)(b) with respect to a deputy sheriff. Thus a deputy sheriff is no longer required to meet the terms of KRS 61.300(1)(b) as to residence. OAG 70-34. (Opinion prior to 1980 amendment of KRS 61.300).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person would not be disqualified from serving as chief of police of a city of the third class where he has only resided in the city and county for one day and is not a qualified voter of either the city or the county. OAG 70-49.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No person is disqualified from holding a position as a peace officer by reason of his residency or voting eligibility except as provided in the Constitution. OAG 70-49.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A deputy constable is not disqualified from serving in that capacity because of his residing in a district other than that in which the constable resides. OAG 70-187.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither the marshal, deputy marshal nor policemen are required to possess the residential and voting qualifications required under KRS 88.170 (repealed) or Ky. Const., § 234, since the enactment of this section. OAG 71-336.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the repealing effect of this section on KRS 88.170 (repealed) and since Ky. Const., § 234 only applies to those officers directly named and designated in the Constitution, the marshal is not required to live within the city boundaries of the city in which he is marshal. OAG 73-634.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A chief of police is a “peace officer” and not a “city officer” and does not have to reside within the city he serves as chief. OAG 73-834.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county police officer is not a constitutional officer for the purpose of residency under the Kentucky Constitution; thus, pursuant to this section, limiting residency and voting qualifications to constitutional officers, the residency requirements of KRS 61.300 and 70.540 do not apply. OAG 74-581.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section repeals by implication KRS 61.300 and, since a deputy sheriff is not an officer named and designated in the text of the Constitution, he is not required by Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since peace officers are not disqualified from holding their positions by reason of residency, a city of the sixth class could employ a town marshal who does not live within the city limits. OAG 76-188.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section remains effective irrespective of the subsequent amendments to KRS 61.300, 63.180, and 95.710 and consequently controls the residency requirements for police officers in cities of the fifth class. OAG 79-505.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislative intent in passing this section was to eliminate any and all residency requirements for elected and nonelected peace officers as long as they are not mentioned in the Constitution, thereby permitting the employment of policemen in all classes of cities regardless of where they reside as long as it is in Kentucky. OAG 79-505.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county ordinance requiring deputy sheriffs to complete a two-week peace officer course at the Kentucky Bureau of Training within six months of appointment, qualify on a pistol range and purchase a minimum of $100,000 professional liability insurance as minimum qualifications for deputy sheriffs is invalid since it conflicts with the various requirements of KRS 70.030, KRS 61.300, and this section which preempt the field of deputy qualifications. OAG 81-35.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not in conflict with Ky. Const., §§ 100, 101 or 234, as relates to the sheriff and constable, since the waiver of residency requirement is expressly declared to be not effective for constitutional officers. OAG 82-105.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 61.300(2), which establishes a two-year residency requirement for certain peace officers, repeals by implication this section, which waives the residency requirements for peace officers, to the extent of their conflict; thus a deputy sheriff is required to have resided in the county of appointment for a period of at least two years. OAG 83-491.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A city council may pass an ordinance requiring employes to be city residents but policemen would be exempt from such requirement under this section. OAG 84-76.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 95.440 was amended subsequent to the enactment of this section, and the amended statute repealed by implication the provisions of this section, even though the amendment did not relate to residency; as a consequence, police officers are governed by KRS 95.440 and 95.710, requiring county residency. The statutory requirement, that of county residency for police officers, cannot be altered by a city ordinance requiring city residency, as such would constitute a direct conflict. OAG 85-2, withdrawing opinions to the contrary — see OAG 71-246, 73-461, 73-556, 76-416, 78-268, 79-369, 79-505, 80-68, 82-225.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a city is required to include the additional compensation paid to each police officer from the Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund as a part of the officer’s salary in determining all payroll deductions, such additional compensation is subject to deduction for the officer’s contribution to the policemen’s retirement fund.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a city has failed to make the four percent (4%) deduction for pension fund purposes, prescribed by KRS 95.580, from the incentive pay paid policemen from KLEFPF funds, there is a responsibility on the part of the city and any current police officer to make the four percent (4%) contribution retroactively. OAG 75-649.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where police officers who have already retired under KRS 95.550 or 95.560 received during their active service incentive pay from KLEFPF funds, but the city and the officers did not deduct nor contribute the four percent (4%) for pension fund purposes prescribed by KRS 95.580 and the officers’ pensions do not include credit for the incentive pay, the officers, if they make the required contributions retroactively, which they may not be compelled to do, are entitled to an adjustment in their annuities crediting them with the incentive pay and the city is obligated to make its contributions retroactively. OAG 75-649.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a city which has a pension fund under KRS 95.520 begins to participate in KLEFPF, the police officers of such city must make donations to the pension fund in accordance with subsection (2) of this section at the inception of the incentive pay program. OAG 76-361.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund payments must be taken into account in computing pension and retirement contributions by the city and the police officers and when a city begins to participate in the KLEFPF program, the city and police officers must make additional payments to the pension fund retroactive to the time the city joined the program.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fourth-class city which instituted a retirement program for city police officers, under which the city contributes four percent of each officer’s gross salary monthly to the pension fund, is required to consider state supplemental funds received from the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund together with the regular salary for purposes of computing deductions for pension fund purposes, since subsection (2) of this section recognizes supplemental payments as part of salary for payroll deduction purposes.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mayor of a city of the fifth class, acting under the discretionary power given him by KRS 83A.080(2), removed the city’s chief of police from office without first holding a due process hearing, this section, which set certain administrative due process rights for police officers, had no application since the chief’s removal was not predicated upon any complaint of professional misconduct or upon any charge involving violation of any local unit of government rule or regulation, and, therefore, the mayor acted within his statutory authority. McCloud v. Whitt, 639 S.W.2d 375, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 246 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a university police officer’s termination from employment was based on an internal departmental investigation rather than being commenced by a citizen’s complaint, KRS 15.520 did not apply. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 230 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police officer argued that his termination violated the due process and hearing protections afforded to police officers under KRS 15.520; however, the appellate court found that KRS 15.520 only applied when disciplinary action was taken against a police officer based upon a citizen complaint, and since the officer’s termination resulted from an internal police investigation without a citizen complaint, the provisions of KRS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>15.520 did not apply. Beavers v. City of Berea, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 1 (Ky. Ct. App. Jan. 6, 2012).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 78.445 and this section do not require that disciplinary proceedings must necessarily emanate from a citizen’s sworn complaint. While disciplinary action may rest upon the sworn allegation of a complaining citizen, this does not preclude disciplinary action by the departmental authority based upon initiation from within and upon any source of information. McDaniel v. Walp, 747 S.W.2d 613, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 621 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987), abrogated in part, Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A discharged employee in a Circuit Court upon judicial review is entitled to something less than a trial de novo, a quasi trial de novo as it were; the trial court in its review is to consider both the transcript and additional testimony, and it is limited to a determination of whether the administrative body acted arbitrarily in deciding whether the employee violated the rules and regulations of the police department. Stallins v. Madisonville, 707 S.W.2d 349, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1034 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The function of the hearing body in instances of charges against police officers is to make two determinations: first, whether the officer has violated the rules and regulations of the department and if so, second, it must exercise its discretion in imposing a penalty. The first is subject to judicial review; the second is not. Stallins v. Madisonville, 707 S.W.2d 349, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1034 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judicial estoppel did not bar an appellate court from considering the applicability of KRS 15.520 to a university police officer’s administrative disciplinary proceeding where the university initially conceded that KRS 15.520 applied, but then it reversed its course before the administrative proceeding was over. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 230 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>

Madisonville v. Sisk, 783 S.W.2d 885, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 15 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mayor or other local executive authority may not receive a citizen’s complaint against a police officer and then fire the officer based on that complaint without ever affording the officer a right to publicly defend against the complaint; in such a situation, the officer is entitled to a due process hearing.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>motion to dismiss plaintiff police officer’s claim brought under the Police Officer’s Bill of Rights was denied because although the officer might have been generally aware of the reasons for his termination (i.e., the ending criminal charges), there was no indication that actual, written notice of the specific charges against him was provided within 24 hours of his suspension as required by KRS 15.520(1)(b). Thus, the officer stated a viable claim which fell outside the administrative hearing context of KRS 15.520(1)(h). Seger v. City of Lancaster, 930 F. Supp. 2d 821, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35540 (E.D.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in affirming a circuit court's dismissal of two police officers' disciplinary complaints because the officers were improperly denied the due process protections provided by the police officer's Bill of Rights where the statute contained no explicit suggestion that the administrative due process rights provided therein were not available to officers confronting intra-departmental complaints,the very idea of standards and of setting administrative due process rights denoted uniformity. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 448 S.W.3d 746, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 605 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Members of the police and fire departments of an urban county government who have had criminal charges filed against them cannot be suspended from duty by the appointing authority or the head of their departments pending final disposition of the criminal charges, without following the procedures and requirements set forth in KRS 95.450 which require that charges be preferred and hearings conducted by the legislative body in connection with the persons whose suspensions are sought or who have been suspended. OAG 80-655.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the mayor under the councilmanic form of government has the sole authority under KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9) to remove nonelected officers and employees, he, rather than the council, would have the responsibility of hearing disciplinary charges against a police officer unless he has promulgated a hearing proceeding otherwise that has been approved by the council under KRS 83A.130(4); on the other hand, the council could, under the authority of KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9), enact an ordinance establishing a hearing board to hear the charges, the members of which are to be appointed by the mayor with the approval of the council under KRS 83A.080(2). OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1)(h) of this section when read in conjunction with the section as a whole clearly implies that police officers against whom complaints are filed are entitled to a due process hearing as therein provided though admittedly the statutory language of subsection (1)(h) of this section is somewhat ambiguous; the use of the phrase “when a hearing is to be conducted by any appointing authority … ” simply means that a hearing is predicated on the initial finding by the authority or body designated to take action in the matter and that the complaint is not frivolous and thus warrants a full investigation to determine its authenticity. OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing under this section that would prohibit a so-called ranking officer (mayor or police chief) from preferring charges against an officer arising from the same incident involving a citizen who declines to make his complaint under oath, provided sufficient evidence is deemed available relating to the incident outside of that which the citizen has sole knowledge of, but refuses to furnish under oath. OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mayor of a fourth-class city can fire the chief of police for insubordination by executive order, unless the officer is under civil service or the police department is funded under the Law Enforcement Foundation Program, in which case the officer can only be removed pursuant to a hearing as provided in this section. OAG 81-132.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mayor of a fifth-class city may not give a police commissioner or any one member of the city council authority to hire and fire on the police force since only the mayor can hire members of the police department or any other nonelective officer with the approval of the city legislative body; however, he may remove members of the police department or other nonelective officers at will, unless the officer is under civil service or the police department participates in the Law Enforcement Foundation Program under this section, or the city legislative body has enacted an ordinance to the effect that no nonelected officer or police officer can be removed without legal cause and a hearing. OAG 81-133.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a complaint against a police officer results in a hearing, the officer must be given notice a minimum of three days before the hearing as required by this section rather than two days prior as required by KRS 95.450, since this section was the later enacted of the two sections and under general rules of statutory construction the later act prevails where there is a conflict between two acts. OAG 81-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where charges are filed against a police officer, the requirement that the hearing be held within three days after charges have been filed with the legislative body under KRS 95.450 is superseded by the provisions under this section to the effect that the hearing must be held within 60 days following the filing of any charges.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where charges are to be filed regarding a complaint against a police officer, such charges must be filed with the clerk of the legislative body as required by KRS 95.450, since this section appears to be silent as to the person with whom charges are to be filed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A part-time police officer in a fourth-class city who receives state funds as part of his salary is not entitled to the protection of a hearing under this section which provides, in subsection (4), that the hearing provision only applies to police officers who receive supplemental pay from the Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund, since the supplemental pay only applies to “full-time” members of the local police department under KRS 15.420. OAG 81-200.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purposes of this section are to establish a system of professional conduct for the police officers of units of local government, to establish administrative due process rights for police officers of local units of government and to provide a means of redress by citizens for wrongs allegedly done to them by police officers. OAG 83-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, in part, establishes administrative due process rights for municipal police officers charged with professional misconduct or violations of municipal rules and regulations; thus, if a city’s proposed policy of documenting the work performances of its employees involves charging police officers with professional misconduct or with violations of municipal rules and regulations, the city must adhere to the provisions of this section requiring notification to the police officers of the charges and a hearing relative to those charges, assuming the city and its police officers are participating in the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund.

<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> When the Attorney General has been authorized to participate in a given case pursuant to subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, he may, at his own discretion, direct a Commonwealth’s attorney or county attorney from another circuit or district to serve as the special prosecutor, who shall be reimbursed for all of his actual expenses.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Attorney General is the best equipped to prosecute crimes against the State Treasury because of the size of his office and his investigative and financial resources. Thus, when subsection (4) (now (6)) of this section is read together with KRS 15.020 and 15.700, it is reasonable, logical and constitutional. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) (now (6)) of this section is not local and special legislation contrary to Section 59 of the Kentucky Constitution. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It could be an undue burden on the county attorney or Commonwealth attorney to represent the Commonwealth in actions described in Subsection (4) (now (6)) of this section. The General Assembly has previously adopted KRS 69.010, in which relief was given to the local Commonwealth attorney in civil actions. Both legislative decisions are legitimate and logical classifications. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1985).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) (now (6)) of this section does not apply exclusively to state employees, but involves any person who receives compensation from the State Treasury. This classification by the Legislature is not unjust or arbitrary and should not be disturbed. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Franklin Commonwealth attorney has not been established as a class of one, for the purpose of showing that this section allegedly is special legislation. Subsection (4) (now (6)) of this section applies statewide and can affect all Commonwealth attorneys. Although Franklin County is the logical venue for the prosecution of crimes involving state funds from the State Treasury, the violations and offenses described in the statute may be prosecuted in any county where the offense occurs. Consequently, the statute applies equally to all in a class and may affect any and all Commonwealth attorneys. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1985).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A writ of prohibition was erroneously granted to restrain circuit judge from conducting criminal proceedings against one charged with violating KRS 18A.140, while the Attorney General was acting as prosecutor, despite defendant’s claim of great injustice and irreparable harm on being forced to stand trial if it were later determined that the Attorney General had no authority to prosecute on grounds that this section was unconstitutional. In cases involving a claimed constitutional defect, as a general rule the remedy of appeal is adequate and prohibition is not proper. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky.

OAG 78-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the county attorney or special prosecutor in district court must prepare the subpoenas, the circuit clerk has the duty to sign and issue the subpoenas and put them in the hands of peace officers empowered to serve process, usually the county sheriff.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) of this section implicitly authorizes the employees of a former Commonwealth’s attorney to continue their duties. OAG 92-101.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The individual designated by the Attorney General as a temporary or interim Commonwealth’s attorney pursuant to subsection (4) of this section is not a <i>de facto</i> officer. Such person holds the position pursuant to statutory authorization, and therefore would not be a de jure officer. The law regarding de jure officers is that they are entitled to compensation at the same rate as the officer in whose place they act during the period that they had the responsibilities of that office. OAG 92-101.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the office of Commonwealth’s attorney becomes vacant, the responsibilities of that office automatically become the responsibilities of the Attorney General. OAG 92-101.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it would be incompatible for a county attorney to hold, at the same time (either through election or appointment) the office of Commonwealth’s attorney, it is not a conflict under Ky. Const., § 165 or under KRS 61.080 for the county attorney, on a temporary basis, to assume the duties of the Commonwealth’s attorney for an interim period until another person can be either appointed or elected to fill the office. OAG 92-162.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Commonwealth’s Attorneys are not covered by the provisions of KRS 11A.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit clerks are not at all subject to the supervision of prosecutors, but of the judiciary, and the fact that a warrant must be prepared by the Commonwealth’s or county attorney has nothing to do with the clerk’s exercise of independent judgment in deciding whether probable cause has been shown to justify issuance of warrant; furthermore, the determination of probable cause is made not from the warrant but from the supporting affidavit or affidavits.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section specifically provides that a county clerk can issue a criminal warrant prepared by a county attorney when no district judge, circuit judge or trial commissioner is available, the authority to sign the judge’s name to an arrest warrant cannot be delegated to the county attorney since Ky. Const., § 28, prohibits anyone in one branch of government from exercising the power in another branch of government, the county attorney being in the executive branch under Ky. Const., § 99, and the judicial branch being under Ky. Const., § 109. Dugger v. Off 2nd, Inc., 612 S.W.2d 756, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 425 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where county attorney issued arrest warrant and signed district judge’s name thereon, he was acting outside the scope of his power under this section and exercising judicial rather than executive branch powers which is prohibited under Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (2) of this section is broad enough to mean that the prosecution of preliminary hearings, involving felonies or misdemeanors, in the district court is a responsibility of the county attorney on and after January 2, 1978; however, since subsection (3) of this section provides that the Commonwealth’s attorney and county attorney in a judicial district shall cooperate in the enforcement of criminal and penal laws, when necessary the Commonwealth’s attorney and the county attorney shall assist each other in the prosecution within their respective courts. OAG 77-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since contempt of court is an offense against the state, and not against the judge, it would be proper to proceed in the name of the Commonwealth with the Commonwealth’s attorney as prosecutor in a criminal contempt proceeding. OAG 78-22.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inherent in the duty of the county attorney to attend the district court and prosecute all violations of criminal and penal laws within the jurisdiction of that court is the duty of preparing complaints, warrants of arrest, affidavits for search warrants and search warrants. OAG 78-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the petition for a 60-day involuntary hospitalization must be filed in Circuit Court, the county attorney would have no duties under this section except where it is necessary for him to help the Commonwealth’s attorney. OAG 78-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney’s duty to cooperate with the Commonwealth’s attorney includes helping him with the grand jury when necessary. OAG 78-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to criminal appeals from district to circuit court, the Commonwealth’s attorney would handle the appeal for the Commonwealth and when necessary the county attorney could be called upon to handle such appeal. OAG 78-190.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the term criminal warrants embraces search warrants, in the event of the absence from a county of all district judges and all circuit judges and all trial commissioners, the circuit clerk in any county in Kentucky may issue not only arrest warrants but may issue search warrants as well, provided that such warrants are prepared by the Commonwealth’s attorney or county attorney, who shall certify, before such warrants are issued, that there is no district judge, circuit judge, or trial commissioner within the county.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section requires a cooperative effort and mutual assistance, on the part of the Commonwealth’s attorney and county attorney, in pursuing prosecutions in their respective courts, but the General Assembly has left it up to the Commonwealth’s attorney and county attorney in determining precisely the need and application of mutual assistance. OAG 82-28.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither KRS 69.210 nor this section specifically require the county attorney to advise a joint city-county planning commission, but KRS 69.210 is sufficiently broad to justify an interpretation that the county attorney should advise a city-county planning commission concerning the interests of the county. However, a county attorney would not be expected to render such advice if doing so would create a conflict of interest situation. OAG 82-377.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If members of fiscal court complain of possible criminal violations, including KRS 61.170, the grand jury is charged with looking into the matter by hearing witnesses who voluntarily come before it or who are compelled to testify under RCr 5.12. If the county judge/executive or other members of the fiscal court seek to appear before the grand jury, even though the Commonwealth’s attorney, as prosecutor, has reason to believe that no actual commission of crime has occurred, the Commonwealth’s attorney does not have the authority to refuse to allow such fiscal court matters to be presented for the grand jury’s consideration. OAG 82-459.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under RCr 5.14 and subsection (1) of this section, the Commonwealth’s attorney may make suggestions to the grand jury, where he has carefully assessed the potential evidence and actually and honestly believes that technically no criminal conduct is involved sufficient to support an indictment, that in his professional opinion no public interest would be subserved by their hearing such proffered witnesses. However, it would then lie within their sound discretion, considering their duty of inquiring into the commission of crime as to whether or not such proffered witnesses would be heard by them. OAG 82-459.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the county attorney or special prosecutor in district court must prepare the subpoenas, the circuit clerk has the duty to sign and issue the subpoenas and put them in the hands of peace officers empowered to serve process, usually the county sheriff.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county attorney is a county constitutional officer, pursuant to Ky. Const., § 99, and, therefore, an assistant county attorney is a statutory county officer for the purpose of considering the general question of incompatibility of offices; since the office of assistant county attorney involves only one office, a county constitutional office, no incompatibility exists even though the county attorney has been given state duties as a prosecutor (KRS 15.725(2)) and county duties as an adviser to fiscal court (KRS 69.210). OAG 80-341.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assistant county attorneys are county employees when hired by an elected county attorney to work for the county, despite their affiliation with the Unified Prosecutorial System for the purpose of uniform enforcement of criminal law and administration of criminal justice, and they are not subject to the provisions of KRS Chapter 18A on compensation except to the extent that this section requires that salaries established by the Prosecutors Advisory Council be comparable with the classification and compensation plan for comparable positions maintained by the Department of Personnel.

Any person may prefer charges in writing against any officer or individual employed as a Trooper R Class, which shall be filed in the Office of Internal Affairs, which shall be designated by the commissioner as the recipient of charges and shall be administratively responsible for the maintenance of good order within the department through the collection and investigation of charges and the retention of their dispositions. The charges shall be signed by the person making the same, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall prefer charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part. If the officer admits the truthfulness of the charges, the commissioner shall remove, suspend, reduce in rank or pay the officer so offending, in proportion to the seriousness of the charges.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> If the charges are denied and the officer demands a hearing within the time above specified, he shall make his demand known to the commissioner in writing. After demand for hearing has been made, the commissioner within twenty (20) days from the date thereof shall arrange for a public hearing before a trial board to be constituted in the manner provided in this section. The officer defendant shall be given not less than twenty (20) days’ notice of the time, place, and hour of the hearing.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Upon the hearing, all charges shall be considered traversed and put in issue, and the trial shall be confined and limited to the issues presented by the written charges. The trial board hearing the charges may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or sittings, by subpoena issued by the commissioner and served upon any witness by any sheriff or other person authorized by law to serve process. If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board, or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> The officer defendant shall have the right to subpoena in his behalf any witnesses he may desire, upon furnishing their names to the trial board or to the commissioner. The officer shall likewise have the right to appear in person and by counsel.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> All charges against the officer defendant, together with all proceedings before the trial board, shall be transcribed and reduced to writing and a permanent record kept thereof.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> In any instance where the commissioner has probable cause to believe that an officer has been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, he may immediately suspend the officer from duty, or from both pay and duty, pending trial, and the officer shall not be again placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until a determination of the charges under this section.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> The trial board, after hearing the charges, shall fix the punishment of any officer found guilty of any one (1) or more charges, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time not to exceed six (6) months, or by reducing the grade if the officer’s classification warrants same, or by combining any two (2) or more of the punishments, or by reducing the monthly salary of the officer by not more than twenty percent (20%) for not more than six (6) months, or by removing or dismissing from the service of the department any officer so found guilty.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(8)</b> For the purpose of hearing charges against any officer, as set forth in this section, there is created a trial board, which shall consist of the commissioner and of a panel of ten (10) officers of the department appointed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall designate from the panel not less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) members thereof to hear charges against any officer in the manner and under the procedure above set forth. The commissioner may promulgate reasonable administrative regulations governing the procedure before the trial board, which do not conflict with this section. The panel or trial board shall be a continuing body, and the officers designated shall serve thereon in addition to their other duties and without any increase in compensation, except they may be reimbursed for meals, lodging, and traveling expenses incurred while in the performance of their official duties as members of the board. Any officer defendant may for cause challenge the right of any member of the board in the trial of any action against him, and if the remaining members of the board find that the challenge is justifiable, the member of the board shall be excused from hearing the charges, and another member substituted in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(9)</b> No officer is entitled to a hearing as provided in this section, unless his suspension is for more than twenty (20) days, or his pay reduced more than ten percent (10%); but if the officer receives more than twenty (20) days’ suspension or reduction in salary of more than ten percent (10%) within a period of one (1) year, he shall have the right to such hearing in the manner above provided.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(10)</b> Any civilian employee may be discharged, suspended, or reduced in pay at any time by the commissioner, pursuant to KRS Chapter 18A.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> With the exceptions specified in this section and KRS 16.193, no officer commissioned under KRS 16.186 to 16.195 shall be removed, suspended, or reduced in grade or pay for any reason except inefficiency, misconduct, insubordination, or violation of law or of any administrative regulation promulgated by the commissioner. Any person may present charges in writing against any officer, which shall be filed with the Office of Internal Affairs, which shall be designated by the commissioner as the recipient of charges and shall be administratively responsible for the maintenance of good order within the department through the collection and investigation of charges and the retention of their dispositions. The charges shall be signed by the person filing the charges, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall present charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand a public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part. If the officer admits the truthfulness of the charges, the commissioner shall remove, suspend, or reduce in rank or pay the officer so offending, in proportion to the seriousness of the charges.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> If the charges are denied and the officer demands a hearing within the time specified by subsection (1) of this section, he shall make his demand known to the commissioner in writing. After a demand for hearing has been made by the officer, the commissioner, within twenty (20) days from the date thereof shall arrange for a public hearing before a trial board to be constituted in the manner provided in this section. The officer defendant shall be given not less than twenty (20) days notice of the time, place, and hour of the hearing.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Upon the hearing, all charges shall be considered traversed and put in issue, and the trial shall be confined and limited to the issues presented by the written charges. The trial board hearing the charges may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or sittings, by subpoena issued by the commissioner and served upon any witness by any sheriff or other person authorized by law to serve process. If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> The officer defendant shall have the right to subpoena in his behalf any witnesses he may desire upon furnishing their names to the trial board or to the commissioner. The officer shall likewise have the right to appear in person and by counsel.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> All charges against the officer defendant, together with all proceedings before the trial board, shall be transcribed and reduced to writing and a permanent record kept thereof.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> In any instance where the commissioner has probable cause to believe that an officer has been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, he may immediately suspend the officer from duty, or from both pay and duty, pending trial, and the officer shall not be again placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until a determination of the charges under this section.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> The trial board, after hearing the charges, shall fix the punishment of any officer found guilty of any one (1) or more charges, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time not to exceed six (6) months, or by reducing the grade if the officer’s classification warrants same, or by combining any two (2) or more of the punishments, or by reducing the monthly salary of the officer by not more than twenty percent (20%) for not more than six (6) months, or by removing or dismissing from the service of the department any officer so found guilty.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(8)</b> For the purpose of hearing charges against any officer, as set forth in this section, there is created a trial board, which shall consist of the commissioner and a panel of ten (10) officers of the department appointed by the commissioner which shall be composed of six (6) commercial vehicle enforcement officers, two (2) facilities security officers, one (1) arson investigator officer, and one (1) hazardous devices investigator officer. The commissioner shall designate from the panel seven (7) members consisting of four (4) commercial vehicle enforcement officers, one (1) facilities security officer, one (1) arson investigator officer, and one (1) hazardous devices investigator officer, to hear charges against any officer in the manner and under the procedures established by this section. The commissioner may promulgate reasonable administrative regulations governing the procedure before the trial board that do not conflict with this section. The panel or trial board shall be a continuing body and the officers designated shall serve on the board or panel in addition to their other duties without any increase in compensation, except they may be reimbursed for meals, lodging, and traveling expenses incurred while in the performance of their official duties as members of the board or panel. Any officer defendant may for cause challenge the right of any member of the board in the trial of any action against him, and if the remaining members of the board find that the challenge is justifiable, the member of the board shall be excused from hearing the charges, and another member substituted from the panel.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(9)</b> No officer is entitled to a hearing as provided in this section unless his suspension is for more than twenty (20) days, or his pay reduced more than ten percent (10%), except that if the officer receives more than twenty (20) days suspension or reduction in salary of more than ten percent (10%) within a period of one (1) year, he shall have the right to a hearing as provided by this section.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(10)</b> Any officer appointed to the department under this section shall be considered on probation for a period of one (1) year from and after the date of his appointment, and during that period may be discharged or suspended or reduced in rank or pay, with or without cause, by the commissioner. The rights conferred upon an officer for a hearing, as provided in this section, shall not accrue until the officer has been employed by the department for a period of one (1) year or more.</p>

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex.

Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

Notwithstanding any statutes, administrative regulations, and policies to the contrary, if standards and technologies other than those set by the Commonwealth Office of Technology are required, the executive director of the Commonwealth Office of Technology shall review, expedite, and grant appropriate exemptions to effectuate the purposes of the unified criminal justice information system. Nothing in this section shall be construed to hamper any public officer or official, agency, or organization of state or local government from furnishing information or data that they are required or requested to furnish and which they are allowed to procure by law, to the General Assembly, the Legislative Research Commission, or a committee of either. For the purposes of this section, “criminal justice agencies” include all departments of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet except the Department of Public Advocacy, the Unified Prosecutorial System, Commonwealth’s attorneys, county attorneys, the Transportation Cabinet, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, and any agency with the authority to issue a citation or make an arrest.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The program to design, implement, and maintain the system shall be under the supervision of the executive director of the Office of Homeland Security, in consultation with the executive director of the Commonwealth Office of Technology and the Administrative Office of the Courts.</p>

<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> The uniform policy shall include a system to enable the criminal justice agencies and the courts to share data stored in each other’s information systems. Initially, the uniform policy shall maximize the use of existing databases and platforms through the use of a virtual database created by network linking of existing databases and platforms among the various departments.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sexual Offender Registration Act, KRS 17.500 et seq. (Act), violated neither state nor federal constitutional provisions as the Act was remedial and not punitive in nature so it did not violate ex post facto laws; the legislature permissibly granted the trial court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Act to carry out its provisions such that there was no separation of powers violation, defendants right to privacy was not outweighed by public interest in people being able to protect themselves from sex offenders, and Act was not a bill of attainder since it neither inflicted punishment nor adjudicated guilt. Hyatt v. Commonwealth, 72 S.W.3d 566, 2002 Ky. LEXIS 18 (Ky. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 909, 123 S. Ct. 1481, 155 L. Ed. 2d 230, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 2026 (U.S. 2003).</p>

While a sex offender’s past conduct is the reason he or she is required to register, the failure to register occurs in the present; an increase in the degree of the offense for failing to register would only present an ex post facto issue if the act of failing to register occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The inclusion of kidnapping as an offense requiring registration under the Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 et seq., even where not sexually-motivated, is rationally related to the Kentucky General Assembly’s stated purpose of protecting minors from crime and potential sexual assaults. As such, the Commonwealth does not violate an individual’s substantive due process rights by forcing him or her to register under KSORA based on a kidnapping conviction. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 et seq., is nonpunitive; therefore, one required to register thereunder cannot maintain an Eighth Amendment claim predicated on its enforcement. Because KSORA does not impose punishment but is regulatory in nature, it does not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v.

Commonwealth v. Newman, 145 S.W.3d 416, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 (2000), applies to any person who is required to register by its terms and requires registration by anyone being released by the court, the parole board, the cabinet, or any detention facility who was 18 years or older at the time of the offense if the offense was a sex crime or was an enumerated offense against a minor. A criminal offense against a minor is defined to include kidnapping in violation of KRS 509.040; the 2000 amendments require lifetime registration for any person convicted of kidnapping in violation of KRS 509.040, if the victim was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant did not make an objection in either the trial or appellate court, defendant’s claim that defendant was not required to register as a sex offender had to be reviewed by the state supreme court for manifest injustice pursuant to RCr P. 10.26. Since no showing was made that defendant had to register under any version of the Sex Offenders Registration Act, KRS 17.500 et seq., defendant could not be found guilty of the crime of failing to register and the indictment lodged against defendant charging that offense had to be dismissed. Commonwealth v. Nash, 338 S.W.3d 264, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 80 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the grant of the employer’s motion to dismiss was proper because the Sex Offender Registration Act did not create a public policy exception to the terminable-at-will doctrine. Despite the underlying public policy of protecting the public from sex offenders and the immunity provided by the Act, it did not provide an explicit right to disseminate information from the registry in a private workplace.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510(10) was not unconstitutionally vague in requiring a registered sex offender who knew he or she would have a change of address to inform authorities; it was the failure to give notice of one’s change in residence, not homelessness, that was prohibited. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 396 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1042 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2007), aff'd, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of former KRS 17.510(7) to define “residence” did not cause the statute to be unconstitutionally vague because the language of the statute was sufficiently definite to put defendant on notice that if defendant failed to register as a sex offender when defendant moved from Tennessee, where defendant was registered as a sex offender, to Kentucky, defendant would be guilty of a crime. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 52 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510(10)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because, even though defendant became homeless when he was expelled from a center where he was living, this fact was irrelevant to the statute’s application; the statute did not require that a registrant must have had an actual place he was moving to. Further, KRS 17.510(10)(a) as written did not cause arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement and did not criminalize being homeless because all sex offenders, regardless of socioeconomic status, had to register with the proper authorities and report any change in address. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2006 amendment to KRS 17.510(11), which reclassified the failure to register from a misdemeanor to a felony, did not constitute a violation of a sex offender’s constitutional rights to be free from ex post facto laws because the amendment did not have a real and direct effect on the punishment for a sex offender’s past crimes but served only to affect the punishment for his commission of a future crime. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 178 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Amendments to Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), KRS 17.510, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution or the Kentucky Constitution because any potential punishment arising from violation of SORA was totally prospective and was not punishment for defendant’s past criminal behavior. Buck v. Commonwealth, 308 S.W.3d 661, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 95 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any potential punishment arising from the violation of the Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>17.500 et seq., is totally prospective and is not punishment for past criminal behavior. While a sex offender’s past conduct is the reason he or she is required to register, the failure to register occurs in the present; an increase in the degree of the offense for failing to register would only present an ex post facto issue if the act of failing to register occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510 (2000) is aimed at both sex crimes and crimes against minors, and that provides support that the Kentucky General Assembly’s purpose for including kidnapping a minor in the list of offenses requiring registration was aimed at protecting children from crime in general, not just sexually-related crime. Thus, inclusion of those convicted of a kidnapping involving a minor is rationally related to the General Assembly’s intent to protect children from crime. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 247, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Applicability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not required to register as a sex offender, and charges against him for failure to register were properly dismissed, where he was convicted in 1990, more than four (4) years before the effective date of the Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), KRS 17.500 et seq., and was discharged from prison approximately three (3) years before the effective date of the Act. Commonwealth v. Newman, 145 S.W.3d 416, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant was prosecuted under former KRS 17.510(7) for failing to register as a sex offender after defendant was convicted of a sex crime in Tennessee, registered as a sex offender there, and moved to Kentucky, the fact that defendant’s crime was committed before KRS 17.510(11) was amended did not cause the trial court to lack jurisdiction to convict defendant of a felony because defendant moved to Kentucky, and failed to register, after the statute was amended. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 52 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>From a plain reading of KRS 17.510(11), it is clear that the state legislature intended to expand the coverage of the felony penalty to include all registered sex offenders. By expressly providing that a sex offender’s first violation of the current version or prior versions of the sex offender law constitutes a Class D felony, the legislature intended to establish a uniform penalty for all sex offenders. As such, a sex offender’s violation of the registration law after the effective date of the 2006 amendment constituted a felony even if he would have been subject only to a misdemeanor under the law in effect at the time he was first required to register. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 178 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 17.510(7) requires sex offender registration of any person who was required to register in another state upon that person's relocation to Kentucky. Because defendant was required to register in Michigan, he was also required to register in Kentucky when he moved there. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 500 S.W.3d 827, 2016 Ky. LEXIS 494 (Ky. 2016).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Requirement to Register.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant pleaded guilty to criminal attempt to commit first-degree sexual abuse on a nine-year old victim, defendant committed a criminal offense (sex crime) against a victim who was a minor; accordingly, defendant was required to register as a sex offender under KRS 17.510(6). Gullett v. Commonwealth, 266 S.W.3d 835, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 294 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of mistake where he failed to register as a sex offender. A mistake of fact did not excuse his failure to pre-register a change of residence, and it did not negate the “knowingly” mental state required for the offense. Lawson v. Commonwealth, 425 S.W.3d 912, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 37 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of mistake where he failed to register as a sex offender, and it did not negate the “knowingly” mental state required for the offense. Defendant failed to show a mistaken belief of law based on his belief that he had to send in a new address when he received a form; defendant did not argue that he relied on something or someone official. Lawson v. Commonwealth, 425 S.W.3d 912, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 37 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant was convicted of failing to register as a sex offender, based on his prior guilty plea to third degree rape and third degree sodomy, the fact that he was not advised, when he pled guilty to those offenses, that he could be criminally prosecuted for failing to register as a sex offender, did not render his guilty plea invalid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graham v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant moved to Kentucky after being convicted of a sex crime in Tennessee, and registering as a sex offender there, and did not register as a sex offender in Kentucky, defendant was properly convicted of violating former KRS 17.510(7), despite not being notified by Kentucky, under KRS 17.510(6), of defendant’s duty to register, because the statute imposed an absolute duty to register, without requiring proof of a culpable mental state, and did not require Kentucky to give defendant notice of a duty to register. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 52 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>6. Withdrawal of Plea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the registration requirement of KRS 17.510, mandatory in cases involving a child victim, constituted a purely collateral consequence which implicated neither the constitutionality of defendant’s plea nor his counsel’s effectiveness, was nonpunitive, and was not a matter within the control of the Commonwealth, defendant could not withdraw his plea based on the court’s failure to inform him that he would have to register. Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 231 S.W.3d 134, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 290 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007), overruled in part, Commonwealth v. Thompson, 548 S.W.3d 881, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>7. Sufficiency of Evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence that defendant failed to register as a sex offender as required under KRS 17.510(11), and, thus, defendant’s conviction on that charge had to be upheld. The evidence was sufficient to support a charge under either KRS 17.510(6) or KRS 17.510(7), dealing with individuals convicted outside of Kentucky who relocated to Kentucky, as occurred with defendant, and the evidence also showed both that defendant resided in Kentucky and had not registered in violation of KRS 17.510(11).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s appeal was untimely, CR 73.02(1)(a), because where sex offender registration was not a condition of probation but was a statutory mandate as a result of the conviction itself, KRS 17.510, the appeal had to be from the conviction upon which it was based, and the time for appeal had passed.

Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1016 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 17.520(2)(a)(4), because the legislature had directed that lifetime registration was mandatory for conviction for two felony crimes against a minor, neither the trial court nor the Commonwealth could provide any lesser requirement; however, defendant should have been permitted to withdraw his plea because the trial court had reason to know the registration period was an essential element of defendant’s agreement to plead guilty, and he was misinformed on the law. Buford v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 187 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court did not err in imposing statutory residency restrictions on defendant upon his conviction for kidnapping as kidnapping was explicitly included in KRS 17.500(3)(a)(1) in the definition of a “criminal offense against a victim who is a minor,” if the victim was under the age of eighteen, and defendant was clearly a “registrant” subject to lifetime registration pursuant to KRS 17.520(2)(a)(1) and 17.545. Ladriere v. Commonwealth, 329 S.W.3d 278, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 259 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Lifetime Registration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in requiring defendant, who was 15 at the time of the offenses, to register for lifetime as a sexual offender pursuant to KRS 17.520 upon defendant’s convictions on two (2) counts of first-degree sexual abuse; none of the sections in KRS 17.520 requiring lifetime registration applied to defendant, in that defendant’s conduct was criminal based solely upon the age of the victims, not because he had used forcible compulsion, and as a result, the trial court should have applied KRS 17.500(2)(b) to exempt defendant from the lifetime registration requirement. Dever v. Commonwealth, 300 S.W.3d 198, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 1 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to advise of the lifetime registration requirement for a sex offender pursuant to statute does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because the requirement is nonpunitive and designed to protect the public. Therefore, an applicant was not entitled to postconviction relief based on the failure to give such advice in a case where he entered a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor. Embry v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.3d 264, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 159 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015), overruled in part, Commonwealth v. Thompson, 548 S.W.3d 881, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Movant seeking postconviction relief must offer some proof of his claims to justify relief; bare allegations in the motion will not justify granting extraordinary relief. Therefore, an applicant's bare allegation that counsel told him that he would only have to register as a sex offender for a decade after entering a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor was insufficient to prove that relief was justified. Embry v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.3d 264, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 159 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015), overruled in part, Commonwealth v. Thompson, 548 S.W.3d 881, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 247, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant did not avail himself of the structure for attacking the judgment of conviction of a sex offense that led to defendant being sentenced to probation and that probation later being revoked, defendant was not entitled to relief from that revocation of probation. Although defendant wanted to attack application of KRS 17.520 that tolled the sex offender registration statute as an impermissible ex post facto violation under Ky. Const. § 19, defendant’s failure to use RCr P. 11.42 and CR 60.02 allowing for postconviction relief precluded defendant challenging the conviction. Lucas v. Commonwealth, 380 S.W.3d 554, 2012 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in reversing the ruling of the Commonwealth’s personnel board to dismiss the employee’s grievance of the warden’s decision not to allow the rescission of the employee’s resignation; KRS 18A.095 does not permit an employee to rescind a resignation prior to the time that the employee actually resigned since the statute does not mention the term “resignation.” Commonwealth v. Searcy, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 103 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 256 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 2007), review denied, ordered not published, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Apr. 16, 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State law enforcement officer was no longer entitled to a pretermination hearing when he was reclassified as a state police employee rather than an executive branch employee; thus, the denial of such a hearing was not arbitrary action.

(Decided under prior law) Pritchett v. Marshall, 375 S.W.2d 253, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 187 (Ky. 1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the only attempt which public employee made to appeal either her suspension or dismissal within the 30-day limit was the correspondence of her attorney with personnel director of the Department of Parks, which correspondence was not directed to the Personnel Board, and did not set forth the specifics of the employee’s argument, but merely stated that “it was not in the employee’s interest to appear” until the matter of criminal charges was resolved and requested that action be deferred until the employee had “the opportunity to defend herself at the proper time and place,” such letter did not meet the requirements of an appeal under this section. (Decided under prior law) Kidd v. Montgomery, 583 S.W.2d 87, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 423 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the board specifically found that grounds to discipline officer existed, but that the penalty imposed was excessive, the board having exercised its statutory prerogative to amend or modify appellant’s penalty as excessive, the Circuit Court on appeal was limited in its review of that action by KRS 18A.100(5) and, in the absence of any of the grounds specified in that statute, the Circuit Court erred by failing to affirm the board’s order in all respects.

Const., § 2, and must be affirmed. Bowling v. Natural Resources &amp; Envtl. Protection Cabinet, 891 S.W.2d 406, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 157 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).</p>

Commonwealth v. McDonald, 304 S.W.3d 62, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 50 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 18A.095(29) did not include any exception from its one-year time limit for filing appeals of actions that penalized state employees based on continuing violations or ongoing penalization; thus, as Finance Cabinet employees were on notice as of January 1, 2003 that their duties were increasing without any change in their job classification or any pay grade increase, their appeals had to be filed by January 1, 2004 and not within one year of the Finance Cabinet’s acknowledgement in August 2004 that the employees had been penalized by the failure to reclassify them. Commonwealth v. McDonald, 304 S.W.3d 62, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 50 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section vests the board with the exclusive authority, if it finds that the action taken by the appointing agency was excessive, to alter, modify, or rescind the penalty imposed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A classified merit employee of this commonwealth is endowed with certain rights and protections, among those being the right of continued employment unless “just cause” for dismissal is demonstrated by the agency by whom he or she is employed; therefore, the rule that applicants before an administrative agency have the burden of proof has no application in a disciplinary proceeding involving such an employee.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Personnel Board properly determined that an agency lacked authority under KRS 18A.095(22) to unilaterally reinstate an employee who had been terminated where her appeal from that termination was still pending; an order from the Board was required in order to reinstate her.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision of former law regarding rules for classified service that employees can be discharged only for cause is fully consistent with the stated purposes of former law providing for general purposes of personnel law.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The reasonable implication of the language of former provision providing for probation period is that the purpose of the probationary period is to determine whether or not an employee can satisfactorily perform the task required of a certain position.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The denial of the employee’s rights to seek review of his discharge before the Personnel Board was arbitrary, where the employee was required to resign from the part-time “status” position to be reappointed the next day to the full-time position, there was no competition for the position when the employee’s classification was changed, and the employee was working full-time hours and the reclassification was simply a change “on the books” to reflect that.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee who was terminated without cause from a non-merit system position in the Kentucky Department of Parks retained reversion rights due to his prior service with the state classified service employment; those reversion rights required a three-step process: (1) upon termination of the career employee from the unclassified service, the appointing authority had to determine whether a vacancy existed in a position in the last class that the career employee had previously attained status within the classified service; (2) if a vacancy existed in that last class, the agency had to revert the employee to a position in that class; however (3) since a vacancy did not exist in the last class, the appointing authority was required only to consider the terminated employee for re-employment in any vacant position for which he was qualified, as specified by KRS 18A.130 and 18A.135. The terminated employee, therefore, was entitled only to consideration for positions for which he was qualified, but not automatic placement. Faust v. Commonwealth, 142 S.W.3d 89, 2004 Ky.

The fact that one of the individual’s letters was subject to a subpoena in an ongoing merit system investigation did not lead to the conclusion that he would be indicted, the newspaper articles and statements contained therein did not establish that the individual would be indicted, and as a result, the individual had failed to establish specific present objective harm or threat of specific future harm.

<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> Any citizen of the United States, who has been a Kentucky resident for at least one (1) year prior to purchasing coverage under this section, shall be permitted to purchase health insurance coverage provided to state employees pursuant to KRS 18A.225 and 18A.2281, under the same terms and conditions as state employees until the Kentucky Health Purchasing Alliance created pursuant to KRS 304.17A-020 becomes operational. The premium charged for coverage for high risk individuals as defined by the Kentucky Health Policy Board shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the premium paid by the Commonwealth for state employees. Policies issued under this section shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, and at the time of the policy’s expiration the insured shall be eligible for participation in the Kentucky Health Purchasing Alliance created pursuant to KRS 304.17A-020.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and the secretary of the Cabinet for Human Resources shall provide for a system to enroll any citizen who elects to purchase health insurance coverage under subsection (1) of this section using the county offices of the Cabinet for Human Resources. Citizens desiring to purchase coverage shall do so through the office of the Cabinet for Human Resources in the county of the citizen’s residence. Payment for premiums shall be made in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, in a manner to be determined by administrative regulations of the Finance and Administration Cabinet promulgated pursuant to KRS Chapter 13A.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Following the close of each calendar year, the Kentucky Health Policy Board shall determine for each of the insurance plans providing coverage to state employees and persons electing to purchase coverage pursuant to this section, the net premium, being premiums less administrative expense allowances, the plan expenses, and claim expenses losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> Each health insurer’s proportion of participation in the state employee health plan shall be determined annually by the Kentucky Health Policy Board based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the insurer with the board. The proportion of participation shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of each state health insurance plan coverage operation by a fraction, the numerator of which equals that insurer’s premium and subscriber contract charges for health insurance written in the state during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which equals the total of all premiums and subscriber contract charges written in the state. The amount of the assessment shall also be adjusted to ensure that the Commonwealth’s cost of providing coverage to state employees does not increase more than the average rate of premium growth for state employees during the five (5) years preceding July 15, 1994.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> Any deficit incurred by the state employee health insurance plan shall be recouped by assessments on all health insurers doing business in the Commonwealth pursuant to the assessment formula set forth by the Kentucky Health Policy Board. The insurers may recover these amounts in the normal course of their respective businesses without time limitation.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> The Kentucky Health Policy Board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of an insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against an insurer is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. The insurer receiving an abatement or deferment shall remain liable to the Commonwealth for the deficiency for four (4) years.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the plan, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the Commonwealth to offset future losses or to reduce premiums. As used in this subsection, “future losses” includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(8)</b> After July 14, 1995, this section shall become null and void.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 18A.350 to 18A.360 clearly provide that unclassified employees will be entitled to the annual increment, the statutes provide no indication as to when the Legislature intended this benefit to take place, and such a decision should be left to the Department of Personnel which has the authority to promulgate rules for the unclassified service. OAG 82-355.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An annual increment under KRS 18A.350 to 18A.360 may not take an employee’s salary beyond any maximum salary for any classification established by statute. OAG 82-355.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Just as KRS 64.640 provides an upper limit for all employees with regard to their potential salary, including any five percent increases, KRS 161.340 must be read into KRS 18A.350 to 18A.360 to provide an absolute upper salary limit for the executive secretary of the Teachers’ Retirement System to be the maximum set for commissioners by KRS 64.640(2). OAG 82-355.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statutory authority stated or implied in KRS 18A.350 to 18A.360 for delaying an annual increment if an employee does not work more than half the scheduled work days in a month. As long as said employee remains in an employment status during the entire 12-month period, no delay in receiving the five percent increment can be authorized. OAG 82-355.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The incumbents of the Workers’ Compensation Board, the Real Estate Commission, the Board of Claims, the Crime Victims Compensation Board, the Board of Tax Appeals, the Parole Board, the Board of Chiropractic Examiners, the Board of Elections, the Athletic Commission and the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission are included in the language of KRS 18A.350 which defines employee as any officer or employee of the executive branch of government; therefore, it would appear that the members of these boards and commissions are eligible for annual increments although it is entirely possible that this was not the intent of the legislature, especially with regard to the members of the Workers’ Compensation Board which indexes compensation to the salaries of appeals court judges.
