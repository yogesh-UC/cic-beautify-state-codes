<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> This section shall not apply to a vehicle used exclusively on private roads or to transport municipal solid waste within the boundaries of or to real property owned or leased by the generator of the municipal solid waste.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> This section shall apply to both publicly and privately-owned municipal solid waste transportation vehicles.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> No person shall operate a municipal solid waste transportation vehicle within the Commonwealth without first having obtained a license from the Transportation Cabinet to operate a municipal solid waste transportation vehicle pursuant to regulations promulgated by the cabinet.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subdivision (9) of this section, the turnpike authority, acting in concert with the department of highways, has the authority to grant additional access points on a turnpike.

The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided for the payment. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate or rates or method of determining rates, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile of the seal shall be affixed to the bonds and attested by the manual signature of the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery of the bonds. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell the bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the turnpike project or projects for which the bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in a manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the bonds.

<p class="p9">There is hereby created a fund in the road fund of the Commonwealth of Kentucky entitled the debt payment acceleration fund. The fund shall consist of twenty percent (20%) of the revenues to the state road fund provided by the adjustments in KRS 138.220(2) excluding the provisions of KRS 177.320 and 177.365. Annually the Transportation Cabinet shall use the funds generated to accelerate the payment of debt service including principal and interest, over and above the annual debt service payments appropriated for each fiscal year, for all bonds issued and any refinancings thereof by the Kentucky Turnpike Authority. The Transportation Cabinet shall notify the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue by January 1 of each fiscal year of the debt payments which are to or have been accelerated in the fiscal year. In the event that, due to bond market conditions, the terms of the bonds issued or other factors, the Transportation Cabinet is unable to accelerate debt service payments, the Transportation Cabinet shall provide documentation to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue that such acceleration is not possible and the reasons therefor. In such an event, the funds not available for debt acceleration shall be placed in a special escrow account in the Transportation Cabinet. Such funds shall not be expended for any of the lawful purposes of the Transportation Cabinet but shall be held in the escrow account until such time as the debt acceleration described by this section is possible. The Transportation Cabinet shall invest the funds allocated to the escrow account and any funds generated from these investments shall remain in the escrow account. Any funds remaining in the escrow account at the close of the fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year for use as provided in this section. In the event that all principal and interest outstanding on any bonds issued or any refinancing thereof by the turnpike authority has been paid, the Transportation Cabinet shall so report. In that event, any funds remaining in the escrow account shall remain in the fund until such time as the funds are appropriated by the General Assembly for any of the lawful purposes of the Transportation Cabinet.</p>

<p class="p9">The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky determines as a legislative finding of fact that the economy of the Commonwealth is, to a major degree, dependent upon the severance and production of coal, which is the most abundant and valuable mineral resource of Kentucky; that there is a serious shortage of transportation facilities for the transportation of coal from mines to market; that many of the roads, bridges and highways situated in the coal-producing areas of the Commonwealth are obsolete and inadequate for the uses to which they are subjected, and have, in many cases deteriorated to the point where their use is hazardous and represents a potential threat to the safety and welfare of the traveling public; and that the shortage of modern, heavy-duty road systems in such areas is seriously retarding the continued economic growth of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky further determines as a legislative finding of fact that the construction and financing of resource recovery roads through the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky utilizing coal severance tax allocations for the amortization of resource recovery road revenue bonds issued to provide funds to construct such roads will preserve and enhance the economic viability of the Commonwealth, will protect and enhance the safety, health, convenience and general welfare of the traveling public, and will therefore constitute the performance of essential governmental and public purposes.</p>

Waste shall include, but not be limited, to nonhazardous nonsoluble construction material, steel, concrete, brick, asphalt, rock, dirt, or other fill material, but shall not include vegetation resulting from land clearing and grubbing, utility line maintenance, seasonal and storm-related cleanup, or any hazardous material or hazardous waste as defined in KRS 174.405.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The purpose of using the site as a repository for waste is to reduce the cost associated with the road project and to level or otherwise create a site sufficient to support industrial activities. The department or the department’s contractor shall use stabilization methods to reduce significant differential settling of the waste. The department or the department’s contractor shall continually grade and compact the waste site, and design surface contours to minimize water run-off, until the site is stable, final grading is complete, and the site is ready for building to begin on an industrial park.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> If a waste site is owned by the state, the state shall deed in fee simple the area used as a waste site to an interested city, county, or other governmental agency upon completion of the highway project after the final pay estimate has been processed.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> The department shall consult with the appropriate elected officials affected by new routes proposed to be constructed in the six (6) year road plan. The department shall consult with the appropriate elected officials to identify waste sites along the proposed new routes that may be potential industrial park sites.</p>

OAG 79-533.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “secondary and rural” is broad enough to include “county roads,” but “county roads” are not necessarily “secondary and rural.” OAG 79-533.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where county fiscal court designated several county roads for repair under the Rural Secondary Road Fund and subsequently the state conferred with party patrons in the county and proceeded to change the list of county roads to be repaired and began repairing county roads without ever seeking or receiving authorization from the fiscal court, the state’s action was legal since the fiscal court was given a chance to recommend as to the project, but the Department of Rural Aid could not agree with the fiscal court. OAG 84-336.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“County Roads” are public roads which have been formally accepted by the fiscal court of the county as a part of the county road system. OAG 85-73.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the statutory definitions, a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution by the state, under subsection (1) of this section, may include a “county road,” as well as a “secondary and rural road.” However, a “county road,” for purposes of fund distribution, under subsection (2) of this section, can only be a road meeting the definition of KRS 178.010(1)(b).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reading KRS 177.340 and this section together, it is evident that the Department of Rural Aid is required to use its sound discretion in considering the county’s recommendations within the Department’s consideration of the development of a system of secondary highways, which may become a part of the state highway system, at the discretion of the Department of Highways.

Whenever the department shall determine that it is necessary that any such public utility facilities which now are, or hereafter may be, located in, on, along, over or under any turnpike project should be relocated in such turnpike project, or should be removed from such turnpike project, the public utility owning or operating such facilities shall relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the department; provided, however, that the cost and expenses of such relocation or removal, including the cost of installing such facilities in a new location or new locations, and the cost of any lands, or any rights or interests in lands, and any other rights, acquired to accomplish such relocation or removal, shall be ascertained and paid by the department as a part of the cost of such turnpike project. In case of any such relocation or removal of facilities, the public utility owning or operating the same, its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate such facilities, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations, for as long a period, and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate such facilities in their former location or locations. No utility shall have the privilege of establishing its lines or properties within the right-of-way of a turnpike, except upon the conditions and terms prescribed by the department; however, a utility shall be permitted to connect its lines with service stations, garages, restaurants and other installations permitted to exist upon the right-of-way of the turnpike.</p>

<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> The department is authorized to provide, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of turnpike revenue bonds of the Commonwealth for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one or more turnpike projects. The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided in KRS 177.390 to 177.570 for payment. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more of the series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate or rates or method of determining rates, payable at least annually, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be determined by the department, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the department, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the department prior to the issuance of the bonds. The department shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the commissioner of highways, and the great seal of the Commonwealth or a facsimile signature of the commissioner shall be affixed to the bonds and attested by the Secretary of State by his facsimile signature, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the commissioner of highways. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until the delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the department may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The department may sell the bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of KRS 177.390 to 177.570.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the turnpike project or projects for which the bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in a manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the department may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement mentioned in KRS 177.460 securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for the bonds or any account or accounts as the department shall have provided in the proceedings or trust agreement authorizing and securing the bonds.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the department may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when the bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The department may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, department, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by KRS 177.390 to 177.570.</p>

<p class="p9">In the discretion of the department, any bonds issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the department and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth.

Such trust agreement or proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the department in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the turnpike project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates of toll to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the department. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or proceedings may contain such other provisions as the department may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the turnpike project or projects.</p>

A sufficient number of service stations shall be authorized to be established in each service area along any such turnpike to permit reasonable competition by private business in the public interest.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> Tolls shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of tolls from the turnpike project or projects in connection with which the bonds of any issue shall have been issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 as to provide funds sufficient, with any other available funds, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing, operating, regulating, and policing such turnpike project or projects, unless such cost or any part thereof has been assumed by the department as provided in this section, and (b) the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and to create reserves for such purposes. Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other department, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth. The tolls and all other revenues derived from the turnpike project or projects in connection with which the bonds of any issue shall have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, operation, regulation, and policing, and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside in a sinking fund or funds which are hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the tolls or other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the department shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the department, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the proceedings nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the department. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of any such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such proceedings or in such trust agreement, any such sinking fund shall be a fund for all bonds provided to be payable therefrom without distinction or priority of one over another.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the department may, in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or revenue refunding bonds under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, covenant to pay all or any part of the cost of maintaining, repairing, operating, regulating, and policing any project constructed under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570, and the department may, in such proceedings or trust agreement, covenant to make up all or any part of any deficiency in the fund or funds pledged to and charged with the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds from any funds or tax revenues available for general purposes of the department and not required by law to be devoted to some other purpose, and, inasmuch as such project will at all times belong to the Commonwealth, any such covenant will have the force of contract between the Commonwealth and the holders of such revenue bonds or revenue refunding bonds.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the department may, in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or revenue refunding bonds under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, pledge to the payment of such bonds all motor fuel taxes and surtaxes collected by the Commonwealth on gasoline and other motor fuels consumed on any project financed under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570, except the two-sevenths (2/7) of said motor fuel taxes provided by KRS 138.220 to be set aside for the construction, reconstruction, and maintenance of rural and secondary roads, and covenant to deposit such motor fuel taxes and surtaxes from time to time in the sinking fund or funds pledged to the payment of such bonds. In determining the amount of motor fuel consumed on any turnpike project the department shall divide the total miles traveled on such project by passenger automobiles, single unit trucks, and semitrailer trucks and buses as determined by the department by the average number of miles per gallon of motor fuel consumed by each of those classes of motor vehicles on the following basis:</p>

In doing so, the commission shall in all respects observe the restrictive conditions presently applicable to said unissued 1956 bonds, in that any sale or sales shall be for not less than par or face amount with accrued interest to delivery, and at a rate or rates of interest not exceeding, as to any bond, three percent (3%) per annum, payable semiannually, and all of such bonds shall be caused to mature as to principal within thirty (30) years from January 1, 1957.</p>

Inasmuch as said unissued 1956 bonds have been taken into account in determining the amount of money otherwise necessary to be provided through issuance of additional bonds as hereinafter set forth, such proposal that the voters remove said existing interest rate limitation as to the unissued 1956 bonds shall appear on the ballots at the election to be held on November 8, 1960, as a part of the ballot question submitting for authorization and approval KRS 177.700 to 177.820 as a whole and the proposed issuance of an additional one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) of general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth for state parks, and for highways, bridges and tunnels, as hereinafter provided.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Billboard Advertising Act (KRS 177.830 to 177.890) is constitutional as a proper exercise of the state police power and the agreement entered into with the United States department of commerce, bureau of public roads concerning the construction of the interstate highway system in Kentucky did not constitute a relinquishment by the state of the right to exercise its police power. Moore v. Ward, 377 S.W.2d 881, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 505 (Ky. 1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Billboard Advertising Act is not unconstitutional as a retroactive or retrospective act since it does not affect or impair rights existing prior to the date of its enactment nor is it unconstitutional as an ex post facto act since it does not impose a criminal penalty upon any person for any prior act and it is not an arbitrary exercise of state police power. Moore v. Ward, 377 S.W.2d 881, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 505 (Ky. 1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Billboard Act and regulations are content neutral since they are not directed at the content of the messages, but at their secondary effects, and they apply evenhandedly to commercial and noncommercial speech. Wheeler v. Commissioner of Highways, 822 F.2d 586, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 7865 (6th Cir. Ky. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1007, 108 S. Ct. 702, 98 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 300 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The interest in promoting the recreational value of public travel and preserving natural beauty along interstate highways is substantial and sufficient to support the content neutral restrictions of the Billboard Act, these restrictions are narrowly tailored to achieve this interest, and these restrictions leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information; therefore, the Billboard Act does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.Wheeler v. Commissioner of Highways, 822 F.2d 586, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 7865 (6th Cir. Ky. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1007, 108 S. Ct. 702, 98 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 300 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In consolidated actions challenging the application of Kentucky’s Billboard Advertising Act, KRS 177.830 through 177.890, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, because plaintiffs failed to obtain a permit for their billboards containing religious messages and the signs were thus subject to removal as public nuisances due to the lack of a permit. While plaintiffs had a right to express and share their religion with the motoring public, the Commonwealth of Kentucky had a right to place reasonable restrictions on the place and manner that message is conveyed, particularly when aimed at protecting public safety and preserving the public environment; government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>search for spiritual fulfillment, yet the government simply could not operate if it was required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regulations of Transportation Cabinet governing lighted message boards which prohibited commercial speech but allowed time, date, temperature or weather information to be displayed were substantially broader than necessary to protect the governmental interests of highway safety and aesthetics. Cabinet failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the requirements of highway safety and aesthetics and had not narrowly tailored the regulation to achieve any desired objectives and therefore developed an unconstitutional regulation on commercial free speech as well as upon noncommercial free speech because the state had chosen to allow some noncommercial messages to be displayed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language in KRS 177.842 extending the definition of “urban area” to advertising devices erected after 1976 was intended only to identify the advertising devices to which the amendment applied, rather than to make the definition of urban area contained in subsection (10) of this section retroactive to 1976.

While plaintiffs had a right to express and share their religion with the motoring public, the Commonwealth of Kentucky had a right to place reasonable restrictions on the place and manner that message is conveyed, particularly when aimed at protecting public safety and preserving the public environment; government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>search for spiritual fulfillment, yet the government simply could not operate if it was required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because of the express prohibition set out in subsection (1), the state does not have the authority to issue regulations allowing advertising within the so-called “Cotton areas,” i.e., areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When KRS 177.865(2) is read in connection with the rest of that statute and KRS 177.860, it does not appear that KRS 177.865(2) was meant to carve out an exemption to the prohibitions on advertising set forth in this section; rather, it was simply a part of the legislation to allow certain advertising devices within the highway rights-of-way to provide directional information for establishments offering goods and services to the traveling public. OAG 83-461.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky General Assembly specifically expressed its intent concerning the “Cotton areas” (areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way) when it enacted subdivision (1) of this section and expressly prohibited the erection or maintenance of advertising devices within the “Cotton areas” and the fact that the Kentucky General Assembly did not mention the element of time of acquisition of rights-of-way indicates that it intended to prohibit such advertising regardless of when such rights-of-way were acquired.

The reference to “KRS 65.220 to 65.300” in subsection (4) of this section has been changed back to its original form of “KRS 65.210 to 65.300.” Subsection (4) was added to this statute by 1984 Ky.

Because it is clear from an examination of KRS Chapter 65 that the range in question is KRS 65.210 to 65.300 and no reason is given or can be determined for altering the text as originally enacted, the original text of the reference has been restored.</p>

Neither dedication nor acceptance need be formal, and both can be presumed from continual use by the public for 15 years or more, accompanied by acts of control on the part of the county court; but mere use, without the exercise of control by the county court, is not sufficient.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county road is a public road which has been accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system by a formal order of the fiscal court and the fiscal court has a duty to maintain county roads, however, the mere maintenance of a road, without any formal fiscal court orders, would not make it a county road; therefore, the fiscal court has the authority to cease the maintaining of a road, without any formal action, concerning which road no formal orders of fiscal court were entered of record.

OAG 81-15.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a proposed street will run from a county recreational park to a city street, city commission approval of the proposed street means that the street will become a part of the city street system, and the city will have exclusive municipal jurisdiction or control over it under KRS 82.082; however, the fiscal court of the county may maintain the proposed street as a part of the county road system under the authority of this section and KRS 67.083, assuming that the city approves of the dedication, subject to the approval of the city commission.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county bridge may only be constructed on a county right-of-way and linking segments of a county road and the bridge must be a part of a public road accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system; a formal order of fiscal court is necessary to establish a county road. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once the fiscal court “accepts” a road segment as a part of the county road system, a formal order of fiscal court would be necessary for its effective abandonment by the county. OAG 82-363.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an old county road is fenced or blocked off by adjacent property owners, if it is determined that the county accepted the road as a county road, then the fiscal court can either abandon it by a formal order or it may improve the road and take legal steps to eliminate the fencing and blocking off activities of adjacent property owners, depending upon what is felt to be in the best interests of the county as a whole. If the fiscal court never “accepted” the road formally, or informally prior to 1914, as a county road, and the fiscal court does not deem it to be in the public interest to now formally accept it as a county road, then it would appear that the fiscal court has no further responsibility nor interest in the controversy. OAG 82-363.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where old county roads were abandoned to varying degrees and were not maintained by the county for over 50 years, but were never officially closed, if the fiscal court either formally (on and after 1914) or informally (prior to 1914) accepted the roads as a part of the county road system, then the fiscal court had a duty to maintain them. If the fiscal court believed it in the best public interest to abandon such roads as county roads, it must do so by a formal order. OAG 82-363.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Generally, a fiscal court has no authority to use county road equipment and crews on city streets, except where the city street segment has been made a part of the county road system for purposes of construction, maintenance, or repair; thus, a fiscal court may contribute to the maintenance or construction of a city street if it so elects by making such street a county through road; however, such county action is permissive only. OAG 82-418.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a county cannot furnish county equipment and road employees to maintain or construct a city street unless such street is made a part of the county road system, the mere fact that an interlocal agreement is being entered into that does not encompass the city street’s being made a part of the county road system would not convert it into a lawful project. OAG 82-418.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the fiscal court had never entered a formal order accepting a road as a part of the county road system and had never acquired the easement or title to the road by instrument or user, it was not a “county road,” as defined in subdivision (1)(b) of this section. However, if the fiscal court had entered a formal order of acceptance and if the public user had ripened into a prescriptive easement for 15 years, it was a “county road.” OAG 82-445.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court can “establish” a road or strip of land as a part of the county road system prior to obtaining easements or title from the owners. However, the fiscal court cannot start road work on the land in question until the owner has received or been tendered compensation; the fiscal court must either pay the owners for the land to be used for the county road or must tender the compensation prior to the county’s going on the land and beginning the road work. OAG 83-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s or general public interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Chapter 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 68.100 and Const., § 180, would prohibit the expenditure of county road money on the construction and maintenance of swinging bridges, which are isolated walk bridges generally found in the mountains, and which by definition are not an integral part of a “county road.” Thus, by definition of a county road, a legal county bridge is a bridge which is a necessary and integral part of a county road. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There must validly exist a county right-of-way on both sides of a stream in order for the county to build a bridge across the stream, and there can be no public interest involved where the bridge dead-ends on one piece of private property. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once the fiscal court entered an order accepting and establishing the particular county roads in question as a part of the county road system, such roads became county roads under subdivision (1)(b) of this section, even assuming that the minimal width of 30 feet was not observed. It was then up to the fiscal court to acquire the additional right-of-ways which would bring these county roads at least up to the mandated minimal width. OAG 83-290.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the city has exclusive jurisdiction and control over its city streets, a fiscal court, with the consent of the city, may, pursuant to KRS 67.083 and this section, take city streets into the county road system by fiscal court order for the purpose of expending county money on the construction or improvement of such streets. OAG 83-321.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county cannot legally accept title to city streets so as to militate against the jurisdiction of the city; in any event, where a city street is made a part of the county road system by fiscal court order, it would in no way take away the city’s control and jurisdiction as relates to city street right-of-way needed for cable television and the county could not include city streets in its ordinance for a cable television franchise. OAG 83-321.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court’s jurisdiction, including its powers relating to the county roads and bridges, extends only to territory within the particular county’s boundaries. Thus, a county had no statutory authority to unilaterally spend county money on a bridge located in another county. OAG 83-340.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court may not haul and apply county road materials to a city street which is wholly unconnected with the county road system, even if the city paid the costs of the materials. OAG 83-398.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county fiscal court may not haul and apply county road materials to a city street which is wholly unconnected with the county road system, with the city paying the costs of the materials; also, KRS 79.110 and 79.120 would not permit the city and county to contract for the county to supply some portion of the cost of the service on the theory that the residents of the city are also residents of the county paying both city and county taxes. OAG 83-439.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section implies that a road segment adopted as a part of the county road system requires any necessary construction and maintenance as a part of the county road system; ordinarily the fiscal court can maintain only those road segments specifically acquired as a part of the county road system. OAG 84-65.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where subdivision road segment used by public school buses in county containing a fourth-class city had not been acquired as a part of the county’s road system, the fiscal court had no authority to make repairs on that road. OAG 84-65.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The discontinuance of a public road, which is not a county road, as defined by subdivision (1)(b) of this section, requires no formal action of the fiscal court; the fact that the county once maintained it is not controlling. OAG 84-358.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>County acceptance of a road segment as a part of the county road system requires a formal order of the fiscal court; though a road may be public because of its public use, it is not a county road where the fiscal court has not formally adopted it as a part of the county road system. Thus if the road is merely a public road, and is not a county road, the fiscal court has no responsibility for its upkeep or discontinuance. OAG 84-358.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The gross weight limit of 36,000 pounds, provided in KRS 189.221(4), applies to any truck, semitrailer truck or truck and trailer unit, operating upon any highway regardless of the nature of its cargo, including coal, timber or other natural resources; the truck weight limitation, which applies explicitly to “any highway,” would include county roads.

OAG 85-73.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering that the statutes permit the spending of Rural and Secondary Road Fund money on “county roads” (as defined by this section), under the explicit terms of KRS 177.330(1), the Department of Rural and Municipal Aid and the fiscal court must come to an agreement in order that the Transportation Cabinet can proceed with a “county road” project, pursuant to KRS Chapters 177 and 179. OAG 85-73.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county may not continue to maintain a road which is not a county road, even if the public has acquired the free use of the road by prescriptive easement and the traveling public requests the fiscal court to maintain the road, unless the fiscal court acts in what it perceives to be the best interests of the county by designating the road as a county road.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is unrelated to the 15-year prescriptive easement rule; it merely provides in effect that any road dedicated by the owner or owners of the property as a public way and used by the general public without restrictions for five consecutive years shall conclusively be presumed to be a public road. Therefore, this section has no application where there is no record of any owner dedication. OAG 82-123.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in this section; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of KRS 178.040(2) had to be complied with. OAG 83-88.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The discontinuance of a public road, which is not a county road, as defined by KRS 178.010(1)(b), requires no formal action of the fiscal court; the fact that the county once maintained it is not controlling. OAG 84-358.</p>

Thus, where a public road is not used by the general traveling public for at least 15 continuous and uninterrupted years, an abandonment could be said to have taken place, without any formal action of the fiscal court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a subdivision plat has been approved pursuant to KRS 100.277 the streets become county roads, and their width is controlled by this section; therefore a county board of adjustments has no authority pursuant to KRS 100.241 to grant a variance of such a street’s right-of-way only to 26 feet since subsection (2) of this section mandates a 30 foot right-of-way, but a lesser width may be all that need be actually paved. OAG 78-567.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in KRS 178.025; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of subsection (2) of this section had to be complied with.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The acquiring of a minimal right-of-way of 30 feet is mandatory if it is to become a county road in the legal, technical sense. OAG 83-88.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any county road established on and after the effective date of the 1914 legislation creating this section is subject to a mandated width of 30 feet right-of-way. The fiscal court can make it more than 30 feet, but 30 feet in width, as to the right-of-way, is mandated. OAG 83-290.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once the fiscal court entered an order accepting and establishing the particular county roads in question as a part of the county road system, such roads became county roads under KRS 178.010(1)(b), even assuming that the minimal width of 30 feet was not observed. It was then up to the fiscal court to acquire the additional right-of-ways which would bring these county roads at least up to the mandated minimal width. OAG 83-290.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A road accepted into the county road system must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet, irrespective of whether it had previously existed as a road used by the public for a substantial period. OAG 91-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet.

They shall make careful examination of routes or locations other than that proposed or petitioned for, keeping in view the possible future development of the county and the accommodations of the general traveling public, and shall report to the fiscal court at a public meeting in favor of the one they prefer, giving reasons for the preference. A map giving the grades and bearings of the routes or locations shall be returned with the report.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> If it appears to the fiscal court that the interests of the general public may be furthered thereby, the fiscal court shall personally examine the proposed work. If the court decides to undertake the proposed work the county judge/executive shall appoint a day for hearing the parties interested, and cause notices thereof to be given to all interested parties.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> If the county judge/executive at any time has sufficient evidence before him to enable him to ascertain what would be a just compensation to the proprietors and tenants, and if the proprietors and tenants are willing to accept what the county judge/executive deems just, the county judge/executive, upon such acceptance being reduced to writing and signed by the proprietors and tenants, may determine to undertake the work, subject to the consent and approval of the fiscal court.</p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section and KRS 178.010 roads crossing national forest land, which have been used for years by the public and for which easements were reserved in the deeds of the land to the United States, should not be maintained by the county until they have been accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system; otherwise the county would be maintaining private roads which it is without authority to do. OAG 74-733.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The specific language of this section must govern, with the viewers being appointed by the fiscal court, acting as a body, and the general procedure of KRS 67.710 not applying. OAG 79-290.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court, in taking action authorizing the alteration of an existing county road, could legally take such action by enacting, at a properly held meeting of fiscal courts, a resolution. OAG 79-410.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a fiscal court votes to establish a road as a county road but the evidence indicates that the proposed road would be of private benefit only, the county attorney could file an injunctive civil suit in circuit court, seeking the enjoining of any action implementing the decision to establish the road. OAG 80-382.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county could not legally construct a bridge across a creek for the benefit of one or two property owners and provide that the owner or owners of the property upon which the bridge is built convey the necessary land to the county by a right-of-way deed. OAG 80-587.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, KRS 178.115, this section or KRS 179.470; however, the reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under KRS 179.470 would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under KRS 179.470 before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The establishment of a county road to a community of two or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.115 and this section, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a circuit court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal could be taken from a fiscal court order to the district court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 178.115 and this section, the initial decision as to the construction or altering of any particular county road by the county is not a mandatory function but is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, which body can determine whether or not a proposed project is deemed to be in the best interest of the county so as to constitute the necessity for such road; the “necessity for a road” arises in the context of the county’s condemnation proceedings, once the fiscal court determines that such road construction is in the public interest. OAG 83-323.</p>

In such case the court may, if it thinks proper, establish the road upon condition that the petitioner shall pay all costs and damages, and make and keep the road in repair, and the court may also impose upon the petitioner, his heirs and assigns, and upon the public, such other conditions in reference to the road as the court finds just.</p>

OAG 72-80.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The acceptance of a road segment into the county road system rests in the sound discretion of the fiscal court, and it is not necessary that roads be deeded to the county before they are accepted by the county as the fiscal court can enter a resolution under this section establishing a county road prior to any acquisition or conveyance of necessary land. OAG 72-81.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Generally, the acceptance of a road for county maintenance, as a part of the county road system, is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, but the action of a fiscal court, in exercising such discretion, could be reviewed in a Circuit Court action under an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion. OAG 78-121.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the format of “resolution or order” is irreconcilable with “ordinance,” the matter of accepting roads as a part of the county road system is a matter of general and lasting nature, and the road matter should take the form of an ordinance. OAG 79-294.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court, in taking action authorizing the alteration of an existing county road, could legally take such action by enacting, at a properly held meeting of fiscal courts, a resolution. OAG 79-410.</p>

OAG 80-368.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The responsibility for determining precisely just what specifically designated road segments and bridges will be constructed, reconstructed, maintained or repaired, rests with the fiscal court as a body, not the county judge/executive, and the county judge/executive cannot order the road department to begin work on a particular bridge without fiscal court approval. OAG 80-368.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The conventional system of county road acceptance under KRS 178.010(1)(b) and this section, and the special acceptance procedure under KRS 179.470 are mutually exclusive; thus a subdivision road may be taken into the county road system by the conventional method, and the provisions of KRS 179.470 would not apply. OAG 80-583.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court has the authority to accept a paved road in a subdivision and place the road in the county road system without cost to the owners of lots in the subdivision. OAG 80-602.</p>

OAG 80-636.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, this section, KRS 178.080 or KRS 179.470; however, reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under KRS 179.470 would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under KRS 179.470 before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The establishment of a county road to a community of two (2) or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of a county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The ordinance for the establishment of a road must declare that the project is in the best interests of the county, if the fiscal court believes it is, and the property involved in the improvement must be described sufficiently to put any contesting party on notice thereof; the posting of certified copies of such ordinance is made mandatory by this section and the posting of the ordinance on the road itself is required to be done by the county road engineer. OAG 82-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and this section, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a circuit court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal could be taken from a fiscal court order to the district court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in KRS 178.025; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of KRS 178.040(2) had to be complied with. OAG 83-88.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s or general public interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Chapter 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There must validly exist a county right-of-way on both sides of a stream in order for the county to build a bridge across the stream, and there can be no public interest involved where the bridge dead-ends on one piece of private property. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the county has not acquired the necessary right-of-way for a bridge, the fiscal court must do so. OAG 83-267.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 178.116(4), concerning access to closed roads, can be resorted to by the joint petition of all private parties entitled to necessary access, even though the time for appeal of the decision to close a road has expired. OAG 83-304.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 178.080 and this section, the initial decision as to the construction or altering of any particular county road by the county is not a mandatory function but is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, which body can determine whether or not a proposed project is deemed to be in the best interest of the county so as to constitute the necessity for such road; the “necessity for a road” arises in the context of the county’s condemnation proceedings, once the fiscal court determines that such road construction is in the public interest. OAG 83-323.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section implies that a road segment adopted as a part of the county road system requires any necessary construction and maintenance as a part of the county road system; ordinarily the fiscal court can maintain only those road segments specifically acquired as a part of the county road system.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court can, in its sound discretion, and where such construction is needed, build and maintain suitable areas for the safe turning around of school buses, but the county would have to acquire at least an easement right from affected landowners for such areas sufficient to justify the cost to the county. OAG 72-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a school bus must travel two-tenths or three-tenths of a mile from a county road over a private drive to reach an area maintained as a turn around pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the county must acquire the private drive interval by agreement or condemnation, since this section strongly suggests that a turn around is part of the county road system and does not contemplate a private ownership or interval between the county’s road holdings. OAG 81-428.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court could, with written permission of the city having jurisdiction over a road or street as a city street, construct sidewalks alongside the road or street where needed for school children. Where the public road is not under the jurisdiction of a city or other governmental agency, the fiscal court would have to procure the appropriate easement rights. OAG 82-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The only exceptions to the basic rule that formal acceptance of a road into the county road system is a prerequisite to a fiscal court’s authority to spend county money on a road or to improve or maintain it, relate to sidewalks and bus turn-arounds for school children, as treated under this section. OAG 82-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section, a fiscal court may, where needed, build and maintain suitable areas for the safe turning around of school buses. However, the fiscal court would have to acquire at least an easement right from affected landowners for such areas sufficient to justify the cost to the county; neither the school board nor the private owner is responsible for such construction. OAG 82-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There does not appear to be any statute permitting the fiscal court to place county gravel on school parking lots, even though the gravel would be on public property and the school system would pay the cost of the materials. OAG 83-398.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A school board cannot lawfully agree to provide materials paid for with school funds, or provide school funds themselves, whether under an intergovernmental agreement or otherwise, for the construction or maintenance of school bus turnarounds within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section.

Any such petition shall be considered by the fiscal court or the consolidated local government at its meeting held on the date advertised in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. The fiscal court or the consolidated local government may accept or reject any such suggested changes in the proposed county through road system.

In determining whether the proposed grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, the fiscal court shall receive evidence of, and shall consider, all relevant facts, including the present and prospective density of highway traffic and the present and prospective frequency and speed of train movements over the crossing, the adequacy of existing or proposed signals or warning devices for the protection of highway traffic at the grade crossings, the possibility and probability of personal injury to the public using the highway and to employees and passengers of the railroad company and damage to property, and the cost of the grade separation or change in relation to benefits resulting from the proposed construction. If the fiscal court finds that the grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, it shall make an order to that effect and furnish a copy thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company. The order shall specify a general plan for the new or changed grade separation. The order shall direct the railroad company to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change in accordance with the general plan prescribed by the order, or may provide that the plans, specifications and estimates of cost shall be prepared by the county if the grade separation structure shall pass over the railroad tracks. The plans, specifications and estimates of cost may, if requested by any public utility, provide facilities for such public utility.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Within ninety (90) days after the entry of an order directing a grade separation or change, and the preparation of plans, specifications and estimates of cost by the railroad company, the railroad company shall present to the fiscal court, plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change, including the necessary approaches thereto.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> After receipt of the plans, specifications and estimates of cost from the railroad company the fiscal court shall give at least ten (10) days’ notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company of a time and place for final hearing with respect to the grade separation or change. If the fiscal court elects to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost, it shall furnish copies thereof to the railroad company prior to or at the time it gives notice of a final hearing. At the final hearing the fiscal court shall consider whether or not the plans make reasonably adequate provision for present and future safety and convenience of highway traffic and present and future safety and efficiency of operation of trains of the railroad company, its employees and passengers, and for the development of highway and railroad facilities, and shall approve or modify the plans and specifications. It shall then consider and determine the method of doing the work, whether by the railroad company or by the county, or partly by one and partly by the other, and whether by contract or by the employees of the county or the railroad company, or both, or by any combination of these methods, and if by contract, the method and manner of advertising for bids, the time and place of opening the bids, the time when work shall be begun and completed, and all similar matters of an administrative nature. The fiscal court shall embody its conclusions in a final order, a copy of which shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> The fiscal court may reject or order the rejection of all bids submitted for the work, or any part thereof, and require a readvertisement for bids. The fiscal court may reject all bids and elect to do the work itself, or partly by itself and by the railroad company, or by contractors, or by a combination of these methods. If the work includes a structure to support the railroad tracks, the railroad company shall have the right to supervise the construction of that part of the work. If the fiscal court elects to do the work itself there shall not be charged to the railroad company any sum in excess of that it would have been required to pay had the contract been let to the lowest bidder.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> In all cases where the work is let by the railroad company on contract, the work shall be done under the general supervision of the county road engineer.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> The cost of all work incident to or occasioned by the elimination of the grade crossing and the construction of a substituted crossing, or the reconstruction of an existing overhead or underpass structure, including, without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the cost of preparing plans and specifications, the cost of acquisition of necessary property and property damage, if any, the construction of approaches, drainage structures, and streets and pavements, shall be paid in the proportion of fifteen percent (15%) by the railroad company and eighty-five percent (85%) by the county.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(8)</b> As the work progresses the fiscal court shall furnish to the railroad company, and the railroad company shall furnish to the fiscal court, a monthly statement showing in detail all amounts expended in connection with the work. On or about the fifteenth of each month, the county road engineer shall prepare a statement showing the total amount expended to the close of the preceding month, the amount paid or expended by each party up to that time, and the amount due from the county to the railroad company or from the railroad company to the county. Upon receipt of the statement each party shall pay to the other the amounts shown to be due thereby.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(9)</b> All payments made on such monthly statements shall be considered only payments on account, and upon final completion of the work the county road engineer shall prepare and furnish to the railroad company a statement showing the total cost of the work, the amount paid or expended by the county or the railroad company, and the amount due from one to the other. Each party shall be afforded reasonable opportunities to verify the statements of expenditures by the other, and the balance due as certified by the county road engineer in his final statement shall be paid by one party to the other promptly upon receipt of such final statement.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(10)</b> The fiscal court and any railroad company may agree by contract as to the method of eliminating any grade crossing or changing any existing overhead or underpass structure. In event of such agreement all notices, hearings and proceedings shall be deemed to have been waived, and the work of eliminating the grade crossing or making the change shall be performed in accordance with the terms of the contract, with the same effect as though the work were being performed pursuant to a final order of the fiscal court.</p>

OAG 84-205.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statutory impediment to the county road foreman also being appointed as county building inspector; however, the fiscal court would have to determine factually whether or not the road supervisor could perform both jobs with care and ability, if he could not, then a common-law incompatibility would exist.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the reporting of the road supervisor at a fiscal court meeting is mandatory, and since the county judge/executive should be present when the report is given, it is mandatory that the county judge/executive be present with the road supervisor on such report occasions.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fiscal court’s resolution acquiring a county road and the maintenance thereof resulted in an unauthorized taking because a proper acquisition complying with statutory requirements could not have occurred; however, owners who acquiesced to paving could obtain no recovery, even if they timely filed suit, and were properly directed to remove a gate. Cary v. Pulaski County Fiscal Court, 420 S.W.3d 500, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 85 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a road segment lying within the boundaries of a sixth-class city may be included in a special services district program established by the county, the legislative body of the city has no authority to turn over any money from its gasoline tax fund or its revenue sharing fund to the fiscal court for maintenance of the city street segment. OAG 76-331.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Concerning the maintenance of a subdivision street or road by the county, the conditions are that the street or road must be at least 200 feet in length and dedicated to public use, and the maintenance must be performed under approval of the county road engineer or the fiscal court under established standards for county roads, as the case may be, and at least 50 percent of the lots abutting the street or road must contain occupied houses. OAG 80-583.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The conventional system of county road acceptance under KRS 178.010(1)(b) and 178.115, and the special acceptance procedure under this section are mutually exclusive; thus a subdivision road may be taken into the county road system by the conventional method, and the provisions of this section would not apply. OAG 80-583.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a fiscal court, in a county containing a fourth class city, accepts a subdivision road or street for maintenance, including other improvements, such as street lights or garbage collection, it is mandatory that at least 50% of the lots abutting the street or road contain houses which are occupied; and special assessments to recover the county’s cost may be imposed by the county against the benefited property owners where road maintenance or other services, such as street lights and garbage collection, or both street maintenance and other services described in the statute, are involved. OAG 80-583.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Accepting a subdivision road for maintenance or for other described services or both by fiscal court is permissive (not mandatory); however, making the special assessments for subdivision road improvements is mandatory, where this section is used. OAG 80-602.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court has the authority to accept a paved road in a subdivision and place the road in the county road system without cost to the owners of lots in the subdivision. OAG 80-602.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section contains no restrictions on the fiscal court’s accepting a “subdivision road” or a “nonsubdivision road” as a part of the county road system pursuant to KRS 178.010(1)(b) and 178.115. OAG 80-602.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a subdivision street is taken over by the county for maintenance pursuant to this section, the fiscal court is responsible for seeing to it that the executive branch of county government maintains files showing the details of the special assessment placed against all abutting property owners; this would include any necessary plats or drawings of each affected lot and a separate file system for each street taken over would be logical. OAG 80-636.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In adopting the procedures of this section, special assessments may be imposed under the specific terms of KRS 91A.200 to 91A.290 and the properties subject to assessment for road maintenance are those abutting or contiguous to the road (or both sides of the road). OAG 80-636.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section would apply where a county contains one city of the fourth class and the rest of the county is basically unincorporated, except for a subdivision located in an unincorporated area of the county just outside the city limits in which subdivision all but two streets have previously been placed on the county road maintenance system and dedicated to public use; however, the subdivision’s streets may be taken into the county road system pursuant to KRS 178.010(1)(a) and 178.115 pursuant to the judgment of the fiscal court and, under this more conventional method, this section would not apply. OAG 80-636.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While subsection (3) of this section mentions that the cost of the maintenance of the roads should be added to the owner’s tax bill, this could not be done, since the special assessment for maintenance of roads is merely a special charge fixed on property to finance an improvement, it is not a tax and could not very often be integrated with the tax billing procedure and the language in a statute must receive a practical construction. OAG 80-636.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language in subsection (3) of this section “notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 178.010(2)” simply means that the exclusive jurisdiction of the sixth-class city over its streets must give way to the fiscal court where a city street segment is taken into the county road system under this section; the city can, where the county applies this section, be absolved from the duty of maintaining such city street. OAG 80-638.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, KRS 178.115, KRS 178.080 or this section; however, the reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under this section would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under this section before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a county which contains a fourth-class city may maintain any street or road which is at least 200 feet in length, dedicated to public use and located in an unincorporated area of the county pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, there is no statutory requirement for a county fiscal court to appoint trustees to maintain streets in an unincorporated area. OAG 81-169.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The method of assessment to be applied for the county’s maintenance of subdivision roads under this section, including any services of street lights, garbage collection, water and sewer systems, is to be determined through the sound judgment of the fiscal court, which assessment shall be geared to the legislative criterion that the cost of the improvement shall be apportioned equitably on a fair basis. In so using that standard, resort may be had to the use of one or more of the methods outlined in KRS 91A.210, depending upon the nature of the improvement and the general circumstances of property ownership related thereto. OAG 82-527.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One of the basic conditions for the applicability of this section, as relates to maintenance of subdivision roads in counties, is that the subdivision road segment must have been dedicated to public use and where a subdivision road segment is private, this section can have no application. OAG 84-65.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where subdivision road segment used by public school buses in county containing a fourth-class city had not been acquired as a part of the county’s road system, the fiscal court had no authority to make repairs on that road. OAG 84-65.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, requiring owners of property abutting certain subdivision roads, in certain counties, to reimburse the county for a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance of such roads, remain effective after the 1990 amendment to KRS 100.277(4); accordingly, a county does not assume “legal and financial responsibility” for maintenance of subdivision roads accepted prior to July 1990, if, by “assumption of legal and financial responsibility,” one means assumption of full responsibility for maintenance of such roads, without reimbursement from owners of property abutting them, where subsections (2) and (3) of this section are applicable. OAG 92-52.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The attorney general opined that the 1990 amendment of KRS 100.277(4) does not provide, even in effect, for assumption of “legal and financial responsibility” for maintenance of all subdivision roads accepted prior to July, 1990, under this section, by a fiscal court. OAG 92-52.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> Upon a finding by the fiscal court that there exists an unabated dust nuisance on a county road resulting from the transportation of natural resources by truck, said court may require the producers of the natural resources that are being hauled on said road to treat said road to control dust. Said producer or producers shall be notified of the fiscal court’s finding by certified mail and shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to treat said road to control dust prior to the county fiscal court initiating dust control treatment. The cost of treatment shall be apportioned among all producers of natural resources using said road. If a producer does not pay his proportionate share within sixty (60) days of the mailing of the bill, the fiscal court may prohibit the movement of the producer’s natural resources on county roads until the charges are paid.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The proportionate share of costs of any producer shall be determined as the percentage which the tonnage of natural resources hauled by or for the producer over county roads bears to the total tonnage of natural resources hauled on the county roads. The fiscal court shall consult with producers to devise an equitable method for determining proportionate cost shares before instituting charges, but the fiscal court shall be the final authority in determining proportionate costs.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> Treatment of county roads for dust pursuant to this section shall not include paving, or laying of rock.</p>

<p class="p9"><b>(1)</b> The territorial limits of an established subdivision road district, as established pursuant to KRS 179.700 to 179.735 may be enlarged or diminished in the following way: The trustees of the district shall file a petition in the county clerk’s office of the county in which that district and the territory to be annexed or stricken off, or the greater part thereof, is located, describing the territory to be annexed or stricken and setting out the reasons therefor. Notice of the filing of such petition shall be given by publication and posting in the same manner as provided for in KRS 65.182. On the day fixed in the notice, the county judge/executive shall, if the proper notice has been given, and the publication made, and no written objection or remonstrance is interposed enter an order annexing or striking off the territory described in the petition. Fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the freeholders of the territory sought to be annexed or stricken off may, at any time before the date fixed in the notice, remonstrate in writing, filed in the clerk’s office, to the action proposed. If such written remonstrance be filed, the clerk shall properly give notice to the trustees of the subdivision road district and the county judge/executive shall hear and determine the same. If upon such hearing, the county judge/executive finds from the evidence that a failure to annex or strike off such territory will materially retard the functioning of the district and materially adversely affect the owners and the inhabitants of the territory sought to be annexed or stricken off, he shall enter an order, granting the annexation or striking off the territory. In the latter event, no new petition to annex or strike off all or any part of the same territory shall be entertained for a period of two (2) years. Any aggrieved person may bring an action in Circuit Court to contest the decision of the county judge/executive.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The property in any territory annexed to a subdivision road district shall not be liable to taxation for the purpose of paying any indebtedness incurred by the district prior to the date of the annexation of such territory, except such indebtedness as represents balance owing on purchase price of road equipment.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the county airport board and a county airport corporation were sued in a wrongful death action after a plane crash, the trial court properly determined that the airport board and corporation were agencies of the county government created in accordance with KRS 183.132(1) and entitled to sovereign immunity. By providing essential transportation infrastructure to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the airport board and the airport corporation were exercising a function integral to state government; as such, the organizations and their members could not be held liable in tort.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county attorney may be employed as private counsel by a joint city-county air board and the compensation paid him would not be considered as part of the income derived as county attorney. OAG 65-837.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is not necessary for a corporation organized pursuant to this section to file articles of incorporation with the secretary of state. OAG 68-238.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Upon the expiration of the term of a member of the joint air board, and the mayor and county judge (now county judge/executive) not being able to agree upon a jointly named successor, the member, whose term expired, will continue in office until his successor is duly appointed and qualified. OAG 70-70.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The city council does not have to approve or affirm the mayor’s actions in the appointment of the members of a city air board. OAG 70-275.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The selection of membership of the air board by the county judges (now county judges/executive) consenting to three (3) members suggested by the mayor and the mayor consenting to three (3) members suggested by the county judge (now county/executive) is a practical and pragmatic method of complying with the appointment requirements of subsection (3)(c) (now (4)(c)) of this statute where the action of one county and one city is involved. OAG 73-670.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no conflict of interest, under KRS 61.210 or 61.220, if a corporation whose president is county magistrate has a contract with a county airport board established under this section as the airport authority is neither a city nor a county board but a separate corporate entity. OAG 74-253.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county cannot pledge money to an airport board for airport purposes out of the general fund, without the vote of the people as required by Const., § 157, unless the amount pledged can be found within the available income revenue for the fiscal year. OAG 74-399.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mayor, as an essential part of the appointing authority, does not have the power to select and submit his name for appointment to membership on the city-county air board. OAG 74-755 (modified by OAG 84-384).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a city-county airport board is an independent corporate entity, neither a city nor a county agency, membership on such board is not an office contemplated by Const., § 165 or KRS 61.080 and is not incompatible with the office of commonwealth’s attorney. OAG 75-72.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A member of the city council may legally serve on the county air board at the same time. OAG 75-238.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Insofar as this section does not expressly prohibit the establishment of two separate local air boards in the same county, a county may establish a second and separate air board despite the existence of another local air board created in joint action with a city, where one airport may be insufficient to serve the needs of all the residents of the county. OAG 76-173.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a city-county air board is a separate political entity from the creating agency, a member of the city council could be appointed to the air board by the mayor. OAG 76-257.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there is no authorization for the use of proxies by members of the air board created pursuant to this section, the use of proxies by or on behalf of board members would be illegal and a board member must be present at a regular or called meeting in order to cast a valid vote on any subject to be acted upon by the board. OAG 78-235.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Of course the fiscal court has no authority to create an additional membership to the air board of any kind, regardless of whether it is advisory or not, since by attempting to create an advisory member to this board the fiscal court in effect would be attempting to amend this section which establishes the membership of that board. OAG 78-505.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county judge/executive may legally appoint the county attorney as a member of the county air board. OAG 78-610.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any appointment to the air board must be made by way of nomination made by the county judge/executive, subject to the approval or disapproval of the nomination by the members of the fiscal court acting as a body. OAG 78-746.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 67.710(8) and subsection (3)(b) (now (4)(b)) of this section are in irreconcilable conflict, and in this situation the later statute should control, and while this section was last amended in 1964, KRS 67.710(8) was passed during the extraordinary session of 1976, and, therefore, 67.710(8) controls. OAG 78-746.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An airport board is a municipal corporation. OAG 79-240.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the air board is a public body engaged in the performance of a public duty, without express statutory permission it is not permitted to delegate and surrender to others its official powers which are discretionary in character and require the exercise of judgment. OAG 79-240.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section governing local air boards does not expressly prohibit the dissolution of the board by the city establishing it, the city probably can do so under the home rule charter (KRS 82.082) by the enactment of appropriate local legislation even though this chapter does contain a so-called comprehensive scheme of legislation on the general subject. OAG 80-345.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since subsection (10) (now subsection (11)) of this section and KRS 67.710(8) are in conflict as to who removes a member of a county air board, KRS 67.710(8), as the later enactment, prevails and a member of a county air board is removed by the county judge/executive with the approval of the fiscal court; the statutes are not in conflict as to the reasons for removal, however, and a member of a county air board can only be removed by the county judge/executive and the fiscal court for those specific reasons set forth in subsection (10) (now subsection (11)) of this section. OAG 80-403.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an air board is established by a county, the air board members are nominated by the county judge/executive, subject to the approval of fiscal court as a body under KRS 67.710(8), and since the fiscal court is therefor the appointing authority, a justice of the peace serving on the fiscal court is prohibited by subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section from becoming an air board member. OAG 80-436.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The persistent or chronic absenteeism of a board member in connection with air board meetings constitutes “misconduct” under subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section; thus where a member has been persistently absent from the meetings without excuse, the mayor and county judge/executive may, after conducting a hearing on the question of absences, and after determining that the member missed three (3) consecutive meetings without any justifiable cause or excuse, remove and replace the offending member under the subject by-law of the air board and subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section. OAG 80-469.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of legislative guidelines of the general assembly, an air board cannot be dissolved or discontinued. OAG 80-556.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the air board repeatedly, and as a definite pattern, and over a substantial period of time holds meetings resulting in a tie vote, thus resulting in a failure to carry out its statutory duties, the fiscal court may file a mandamus action in circuit court against the board, seeking a judgment compelling the members to perform merely ministerial duties or to direct that its discretionary duties be performed, though not to direct the particular manner of the performance of a discretionary duty. OAG 80-556.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a city-county air board is entrusted with the control and custody of public funds, the officers of the air board must comply with the provisions of KRS 424.220 concerning the preparation and publication of an annual financial statement. OAG 80-577.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the purpose of legal advertisements, the “publication area” for the Kenton County airport board is Kenton County, inasmuch as the operation of the Kenton County airport, though conducted in the main in Boone County, is an official activity of the airport board, which was created by Kenton County and which is derivatively a board of Kenton County. OAG 80-584.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Persons appointed to fill vacancies on local air boards pursuant to subsection (4) (now (8)) of this section can only serve throughout the remainder of the unexpired term of their predecessors and would, under no circumstances, serve full four-year terms calculated from the date of their appointment. OAG 81-348.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A regional airport board created by four counties acting jointly may be expanded from a six-member board to a ten (10) member board; if the four fiscal courts vote to expand the board membership to ten, then the ten (10) members shall be appointed by the joint action of the county judge/executives of the participating counties, without the necessity for approval by the respective fiscal courts, as a body, of the member counties. OAG 84-269.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an airport board is a joint board, it is a hybrid agency authorized by statute between the cities and county; thus, a municipal officer could be appointed to such board without violating the prohibition against a municipal officer holding any other municipal, county or state office at the same time, contained in KRS 61.080 and Const., § 165, provided the appointment is made jointly by the mayor of the other city and the county judge/executive, and the appointee is not present during the voting. OAG 84-384, modifying OAG 74-755.</p>

OAG 85-97.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the explicit language of KRS 183.476, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

While KRS 173.340 and 212.855 impose a limit on consecutive terms, as relate to a library board and a district board of health, the General Assembly has established no policy limiting the number of consecutive terms for members of the other boards and commissions, and there is no statutory authority for the fiscal court’s enacting such a policy as relates to the four bodies not covered by statute.

<p class="p9"><b>(2)</b> The board shall establish and fix reasonable rates, charges and fees for the use of the landing area, ramps and other common aviation facilities. In fixing such rates, charges or fees the board may take into consideration, among other factors, the total capital investment by the board or other local or state governmental authority, the revenue needed properly to maintain such facilities, the revenue needed properly to expand the airport and its facilities, the portion of the facilities utilized by the licensee or contracting party and its customers and the volume and type of business conducted. Any party aggrieved by the rates, charges or fees may appeal from the action of the board to the Circuit Court of the county within which the board operates, within ninety (90) days from the date that the board finally publishes such rates, charges or fees and gives notice of same to the contracting party or licensee. The Circuit Court may hear evidence and determine whether or not the rates, charges or fees are, or are not, reasonable in amount. Appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court may be prosecuted as any other civil appeal.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(3)</b> The board shall likewise have power, from time to time, to fix rates, charges or fees by contract, or by publishing general rates, charges or fees for commercial vendors, concessionaires or other persons for the use or occupancy of terminal or other ground use facilities, under such terms or conditions as it may deem to be in the best interest of maintaining, operating or expanding necessary airport or air navigation facilities, and the public use thereof.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(4)</b> The board may acquire by contract, lease, purchase, gift, condemnation or otherwise any real or personal property, or rights therein, necessary for establishing, operating or expanding airports and air navigation facilities. The board may erect, equip, operate and maintain on such property, buildings and equipment necessary, desirable or appropriate for airport or air navigation facilities. The board may dispose of any real or personal property, or rights therein, which, in the opinion of the board are no longer needed for operating or expanding the airport or air navigation facilities.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(5)</b> The board or any other governmental unit may by resolution reciting that the property is needed for airport or air navigation purposes direct the condemnation of any property, including navigation or other easements. The procedure for condemnation shall conform to the procedures set out in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(6)</b> The board or any other governmental unit may from time to time make, adopt and enforce such rules, regulations and ordinances as it may find necessary, desirable or appropriate for carrying into effect the purposes of this chapter, including those relating to the operation and control of the airport, airport facilities or air navigation facilities owned or operated by such board or such other governmental unit. All rules, regulations and ordinances adopted pursuant to this section shall be published according to the provisions of KRS 424.130, and the board or other governmental unit adopting them shall keep a permanent record of such rules, regulations and ordinances available for public inspection, on the airport premises. Prosecution for a violation of any rule, regulation or ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be in the District Court of any county within which the airport is located.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>(7)</b> Any board may engage in activities to promote, encourage or develop the use of airports or air navigation facilities under its control and any board which has members thereof appointed by the Governor shall be assisted in such activities by the state Cabinet for Economic Development if it requests such assistance from the cabinet.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the explicit language of this section, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the Authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

The proceeds of the suit shall be paid to the treasurer of the district and by him applied to the redemption of matured bonds as if the payment had been made without suit. In such a suit, an allegation in substance that the improvement of the road had been duly made and completed and such assessment levied therefor and bonds for unpaid portion of the cost had been issued pursuant to resolutions and proceedings duly adopted and had by the board of directors in accordance with law, shall be a sufficient pleading of such resolutions and proceedings without setting the same out in full or making further reference thereto. The road district is hereby authorized to bid an amount not in excess of its lien and costs for any property sold in such suit.</p>
