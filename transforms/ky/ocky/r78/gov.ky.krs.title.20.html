    Where the statute not only gives the alcoholic beverage control board authority to stop the sale of whiskey on the premises, but also confers upon it authority to prevent the premises from being used for any purpose, it amounts, in effect, to the taking of private property, which cannot be done even by the state without due process of law.

   <p class="p10">
    A county cannot collect license fees from package store owners in a city of the first four classes for the authority for issuing such licenses rests exclusively with the city authorities to the absolute exclusion of the county authorities. OAG 61-31.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Although there is no statutory prohibition against appointing as city alcoholic beverage administrator an insurance agent representing a company presently doing business with the city and who may do business with the city in the future, there would be a common-law conflict of interest. OAG 74-33.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A councilman in a fourth-class city may be assigned the duties of alcoholic beverage control administrator for the city and receive compensation from both positions but he should not vote on either the question of his selection as alcoholic beverage control administrator or on the compensation fixed for the performance of the additional duties assigned to him, as this might create a common-law conflict of interest. OAG 74-68.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A member of the city council may serve concurrently as the city alcoholic beverage commissioner if such duties are assigned by the city council to one of the council members, but if the office of alcoholic beverage commissioner is created by ordinance, the office is a municipal office and KRS 61.080 and Ky Const., § 165 prohibit a person from filling two municipal offices at the same time. OAG 74-82.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where councilman is assigned duties of alcoholic beverage control administrator under this section, such assignment did not violate KRS 61.080 in that said councilman would not be occupying two city offices at the same time, since the council was assigning the duties of the office and not creating a new office. OAG 74-292.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A member of a town board of trustees can be legally assigned the duties of the office of alcoholic beverage control administrator under authority of this section as the board member would not be holding another municipal office in violation of Ky. Const. § 165 and KRS 61.080. OAG 74-576.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    If a city creates a separate office of alcoholic beverage control administrator or assigns the duties of the office to a present city office, such as mayor or city council member, such action must be taken by ordinance. OAG 76-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    An ordinance which created the office of city alcoholic control administrator in a fourth class city and vested the powers and duties of the administrator in the mayor was in violation of this section, which provides that such office may either be created or its duties assigned to an existing office, and also violated subsection (3) of KRS 61.080 and Const., § 165 which prohibit any person from filling two municipal offices at the same time; however, the city council could amend or revise the ordinance to state that the duties of the administrator should be assigned to the office of the mayor, thereby avoiding the creation of a separate municipal office.

Howard v. Salyer, 695 S.W.2d 420, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 247 (Ky. 1985).

    Where county judge (now county judge/executive) did not show himself to be qualified as a handwriting expert, he had no authority, on the basis of his own comparison of the signatures on the petition with the signatures on the registration books of the county, to strike names from the petition on the ground that the signatures were not genuine, particularly where there was direct positive testimony by the persons in question that they did sign the petition. Widick v. Pursifull, 299 Ky. 773, 187 S.W.2d 447, 1945 Ky. LEXIS 791 (Ky. 1945).
   </p>

Boyd v. Alexander, 284 S.W.2d 85, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 15 (Ky. 1955).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    If the county judge/executive is satisfied with the petition for a local option election prima facie, or has personal knowledge without hearing evidence, that signatures and petitioners are what and whom they purport to be, and constitute the required percent of voters, he is authorized to order the election.

    Where there were 46 separate papers or units of petition for local option election circulated over the county and the number of voters signing all these petitions aggregated the sum of approximately 2,200 and clerk on receipt of the bundle of petitions placed his indorsement on the back of the outside petition there was substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and contention that only the petition indorsed by the clerk could be counted was in error. Rodgers v. Campbell, 267 Ky. 261, 101 S.W.2d 937, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 301 (Ky. 1937); Wilson v. Lawrence, 268 Ky. 179, 103 S.W.2d 955, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 427 (Ky. 1937).

    There is a presumption that each signature upon a petition was written by the voter himself. Boyd v. Alexander, 284 S.W.2d 85, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 15 (Ky. 1955).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A local option election ballot designating voting precinct by name only, was not fatally defective for failure to set out precinct number and name of county, where election order, signed by the county judge (now county judge/executive), directing the sheriff to advertise order in county newspaper, and post notices in precinct, clearly identified the county and the precinct number, and there was no evidence that voters did not know location of precinct. Robinson v. Spradlin, 303 Ky. 451, 197 S.W.2d 919, 1946 Ky. LEXIS 866 (Ky. 1946).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Voters living in magisterial districts which were dry territory by reason of previous district elections were qualified voters of the “territory to be affected” within the meaning of this section, as concerned petition for county-wide local option election, notwithstanding that adoption of county-wide prohibition would not change status in such districts. Widick v. Pursifull, 299 Ky. 773, 187 S.W.2d 447, 1945 Ky. LEXIS 791 (Ky. 1945).

   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    There is nothing in the words of this section to suggest a legislative intent that a precinct once established is irrevocably fixed in perpetuity as a local option voting unit. Reeves v. Zirkle, 331 S.W.2d 723, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 1959).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where the county voted dry as a unit, another vote on the question by less than the county unit would be contrary to law. Stice v. Milliken, 343 S.W.2d 824, 1961 Ky. LEXIS 440 (Ky. 1961).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    It is not mandatory that the order be made at the current or next regular term, it being permissible to make the order at a subsequent regular term, yet it must be done a sufficient length of time before the election is held to amount to a substantial compliance with the statute. Hardigree v. White, 266 Ky. 648, 99 S.W.2d 785, 1936 Ky. LEXIS 730 (Ky. 1936).

   <p class="p10">
    Where a proper petition for a local option election was filed during a special term of the county court and an order calling an election was immediately entered, and, during the second succeeding regular term, the county judge (now county judge/executive) withdrew the void order (an order calling an election must be entered during a regular term), but refused to permit petitioners to withdraw the petition and refile same, or to sustain their motion to enter an order calling an election based upon the petition as originally filed, mandamus issued directing county judge (now county judge/executive) to follow the latter procedure. Martin v. Cheek, 309 Ky. 319, 217 S.W.2d 785, 1949 Ky. LEXIS 700 (Ky. 1949).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where a county judge fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of this section and does not call an election at the current or next regular term after the filing of the petition, this failure should be regarded as a clerical misprision which may be corrected as such. Howard v. Carty, 275 S.W.2d 68, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 349 (Ky. 1955).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Since present statute does not except druggists as did former law, clause “shall apply to druggists” in the court order calling an election under this section is mere surplusage and did not invalidate the court order. Cassady v. Jewell, 268 Ky. 643, 105 S.W.2d 810, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 511 (Ky. 1937).
   </p>

   <p class="p10">
    Election is not invalid because the order calling for it used the word “census” instead of “sense” as in this section. Duncan v. McMurray, 249 S.W.2d 156, 1952 Ky. LEXIS 809 (Ky. 1952).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    County court had no jurisdiction at special term to amend original order, made at prior term, directing local option election to be held, to include territory not included in original order. Ray v. Spiers, 281 Ky. 549, 136 S.W.2d 750, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 65 (Ky. 1940).

   </h4>
   <p class="p10">
    The phrase “qualified voter” as used in this section means a voter who is constitutionally qualified and properly registered, so that a person who signs a local option petition must be 18 years of age, a resident of the state for one year, of the county for six months, and of the precinct for 60 days as prescribed by Ky Const., § 145, and be a duly registered voter, but need not have voted in the last election. OAG 66-190.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    While under subsection (1) of this section, a petition may consist of one or more separate units, each unit should clearly indicate that it is part of a single petition calling for a local option election on a certain date. OAG 66-190.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    In a county-wide local option election, cities of the first four classes vote separately and are not controlled by the vote in the rest of the county. OAG 66-309.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Once an entire county has voted dry, no smaller unit of that county can hold a separate election for voting wet except for cities of the first four classes. Accordingly, a county court should not order a local option election to be held in a county that has voted dry even though the petition filed with the court meets all the requirements of this section. OAG 70-500.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Although the addresses following the names on a petition are not specific, such signatures should be counted in determining the number of valid signatures unless the names are challenged. OAG 73-64.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Once a petition for the holding of a local option election has been filed with the county court clerk, the petition containing the signatures of the petitioners becomes a record of the county clerk and the petition signer no longer possesses the right to enjoin or prohibit the use of his name without his consent, so that a citizen or a group of citizens could obtain all of the names on a local option petition calling for an election on the sale of alcoholic beverages and publish the names of the signers without the consent of the signers. OAG 73-134.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    When the boundaries of a precinct are changed in order to decrease the number of registered voters to the legal maximum of 700 as provided by KRS 127.050 (repealed), a local option election can be validly called in the new precinct only upon a petition of qualified voters of the new precinct equal to 25 percent of the votes cast by the voters in the new precinct at the last preceding general election. OAG 73-300.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    There is no time limit as to when a petition must be filed after the first petitioner signs the petition, but all signers of the petitions for local option elections must be registered voters so that the signature of anyone who has moved out of the territory or who has died prior to the filing date of the local option election petition cannot be considered the signature of a “constitutionally qualified voter.” OAG 73-707.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A local option election may not be held for an annexed portion of a city where the portion is less than a whole precinct as the smallest division encompassed by the term “territory” is a precinct. OAG 74-451.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where, subsequent to local option election in city in which city voted “wet,” territory was annexed to city, application for a malt beverage license should have been denied since the annexed territory encompassing the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was being sought remained “dry” after becoming annexed to the city and an election would have to be held in the entire precinct encompassing the annexed territory and therefore in the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was sought in order to redetermine the local option status of the annexed territory, including the business location in question. OAG 76-644.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Any part of a “wet” magisterial district that is subsequently reapportioned into another magisterial district will remain “wet” and any part of a “dry” magisterial district that is subsequently reapportioned to another magisterial district will remain “dry.” OAG 77-10.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The holding of a city-wide election which produces a vote against prohibition does not prevent a local option election from thereafter being held in any precinct of the city. OAG 79-382.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The smallest area considered and defined as a territory is a precinct and no smaller political unit or area of a city or county can hold a local option election. OAG 79-382.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where three commercial liquor establishments located in a county precinct about to have a local option election were annexed by a “wet” city the day before the election, they were no longer a part of that precinct and would be unaffected by the outcome of the election. OAG 79-580.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A voter who signs a petition for a local option election must indicate his address opposite his name for identification purposes that can either be his exact residence or a post office address, since such designation has been held to be directory rather than mandatory and the clerk may exercise his own discretion as to whether the designation is sufficient in order to identify the petitioner as a qualified voter. OAG 80-431.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A petition for a local option election is a public record and may be inspected by any person and the petition may be published in a newspaper or in any other manner, including the names of the persons who signed the petition; unless a person purported to have signed a petition has had the court declare that his name was placed on the petition without the person’s authority and should therefore be removed, the person has no legal recourse if his name is made public as a signer of the petition and there is no liability for the disclosure of the petition and the names thereon. OAG 80-450.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    When a local option election is confined to the corporate limits of the city, only those qualified voters residing within the city are entitled to sign the petition or to vote in the election; the clerk, in sending out the registration lists to the split precincts, should indicate which voters live within or without the city so that the election officers can lockout the local option election for those voters who may appear but who are not entitled to vote in the city election by virtue of being nonresidents. OAG 80-466.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    When a local option petition is filed, it is the responsibility of the clerk, on behalf of the county judge/executive who calls the election, to check the petition to see if the correct percentage of the qualified voters have signed as required by this section; following the filing of the petition it can be challenged in court by any qualified voter in opposition to the election. OAG 80-466.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A local option election petition must be signed by voters who are duly registered and thereby presumed to be constitutionally qualified to vote. OAG 80-492.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    It is the county judge/executive who is responsible for examining the petition for a local option election on its face to determine whether the petition is correctly filed under the express terms of this section, but the county judge/executive can call on the clerk to assist him in comparing the petition with the voters’ registration data on file in the clerk’s office; where the county judge/executive has good reason to believe that a particular signature is not genuine, he may ask the person with that name to voluntarily come to the county judge/executive’s office to give evidence about it, one way or the other, and if it appears to the county judge/executive, after such evidence, that someone other than the so-called petitioner signed his name without authority, the county judge/executive may eliminate such name by an order in his executive order book, and such signature will not be counted as a petitioner. OAG 80-495; 82-538.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    So long as it appears a signer is a constitutionally qualified voter in the county and that he signed his own name, a misstatement as to his residence would not be a basis for the county judge/executive’s ordering the elimination of that name from the local option election petition. OAG 80-495.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The county judge/executive has no authority to issue subpoenas in connection with the examination of a petition for a local option election. OAG 80-495.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The smallest territory in which a local option election may be held is a precinct. OAG 81-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A petition for a local option election is to be kept by the county clerk, as he is the one with whom the petition is required to be filed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. OAG 83-134.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A county clerk cannot be held liable in a civil suit for making a petition for a local option election available to the public for inspection or having a copy made since, by law, it becomes a public record when it is filed subject to both inspection and copying; the mere fact that the petition is subsequently declared invalid for insufficient compliance with the statute would have no bearing on the clerk’s civil liability. OAG 83-134.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Once a petition for a local option election is filed and duly recorded, it becomes a public record irrespective of whether or not it is found to meet the statutory requirements for validity and cannot be withdrawn. Thus, where the petition was ruled invalid for not containing a sufficient number of signatures, those favoring a referendum on the subject would be required to start over and submit an entirely new petition. OAG 83-134.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    As long as the petitioner is registered to vote prior to the filing of the petition, his signature should be counted as a valid signature, even though at the time he may have signed the petition he had not registered. OAG 85-60.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A petition is valid if it contains sufficient information to determine if a sufficient number of qualified voters request the election, regardless of whether the petition strictly complies with the provisions of the statute. OAG 91-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    If a petition could be valid despite the omission of Social Security numbers, it necessarily follows that an irregularity in the inclusion of the numbers, such as using voter’s files from the clerk’s office to add the numbers to the signed petition, would not necessarily invalidate the petition. OAG 91-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The complete omission of a Social Security number or date of birth would not necessarily invalidate a petition, as long as the county judge/executive can make the required determination of whether a sufficient number of voters request the election. OAG 91-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The petition must state the petitioner’s address, and the date on which he signed, and either the petitioner’s Social Security number or date of birth. OAG 91-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    As the date may be omitted entirely without disqualification of the voter’s signature, it follows that a mere alteration to the date does not necessarily disqualify the petition or the signature. OAG 91-204.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    If the signers were in fact registered as of the original date on the petition and not the altered date, then the names may be counted. OAG 91-204.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A local option petition may be supplemented at any time before the county judge/executive has made a determination regarding the sufficiency of the petition. After the county judge/executive has determined that the petition either is or is not sufficient, the petitioners may not tender supplemental signatures. OAG 92-132.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The petition is filed with the clerk, since the clerk is the official custodian of such records, and the clerk then delivers the petition to the county judge/executive. OAG 92-132.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The petitioner must state his social security number or date of birth. If this information is given, the clerk should be able to determine the identity of the person signing even though the actual signature may be illegible. Therefore an illegible signature should be disallowed only if the clerk or the county judge/executive is unable to determine the petitioner’s identity after consulting the other information given on the petition. OAG 92-132.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The provisions of the local option statute requiring petitioners to state their address and date of signing were “directory” rather than mandatory, and therefore the names of petitioners should be counted even if they omitted the address or date entirely. OAG 92-132.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    This section, in conjunction with the general law on petitions, requires that a petitioner be a qualified voter both at the time the petition is signed and at the time it is filed. OAG 92-132.

Therefore trial court, in contest of local option election, did not err in failing to grant contestants more than five days additional time in which to take proof concerning insufficiency of signatures on petition.

    Under Ky. Const. § 61, the General Assembly was given the authority to determine policy and draft laws regulating alcohol, and to that end, the General Assembly drafted KRS 242.030 setting forth the requirements for a local option election about whether the sale of alcohol would be permitted and dictating that no local option election could be held in the same territory more than once in every three years. Accordingly, the precinct could not hold a local option election approximately five weeks after one had just been held, as KRS 242.010 barred counties within which the precincts were located from holding a local option election so soon after the last local option election.

    Where the places selected by officers for posting notice of local option election were not the most conspicuous, but were at least public places, the court was not convinced that such places were so inconspicuous as to fail to meet the requirements of this section, especially since the city wherein the election was held was small and nearly 1,000 people out of a total population of 2,375 voted in the election.

    While the statute requires the sheriff to report in writing to the county court that such notices have been published and posted, yet such provision is not mandatory, and the failure of the sheriff to technically comply with the statute in that respect will not render the election invalid.

    Defect in sheriff’s return, in stating that he had advertised that “election would be held at least five times in conspicuous places in each precinct,” instead of stating that the handbills were posted in five conspicuous places in each precinct, was cured by amended answer and sheriff’s testimony in contest suit, showing proper advertisement.

    Failure of sheriff to report in writing to county courts that the notices of proposed election had been published and posted, which was an important process that should be observed, was not a mandatory provision after the election had been held, and issue as to whether notices were posted and published as required by law could be raised in a contest, though sheriff did not file his report, the difference being in the matter of the burden and weight of evidence.

    Where the entire county had previously been voted dry, a local option election could be held in and for a fourth-class city even though there was no election being held for the entire county. OAG 71-316.

    For a local option election in a city with three (3) precincts, an election would have to be held simultaneously in each of the three (3) districts. OAG 71-541.

   <p class="p10">
    There is no authority for a city of the fifth class to hold a local option election, as any such election would have to be on a countywide basis. OAG 72-181.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    If an entire county is dry, no individual precinct may conduct its own local option election, nor may one precinct conduct such an election if the city is dry; however, if the county is wet or the city is wet, then a precinct may vote to go from wet to dry. OAG 72-591.

    If the referendum for alcoholic beverages in Williamsburg passes and if, at the time of the election, the entire city was dry territory, pursuant to former subsection (3) of this section, the city council’s license ordinance under KRS 243.070 would have to apply to all city territory and it could not apply to designated areas of the city.

    When “dry” territory is annexed to “wet” territory, the annexed territory is not automatically “wet” and a local option election may be held in the precinct, including the annexed territory, and the outcome of this election will determine the “wet” or “dry” status of the entire precinct, as the way the majority of the voters in either the annexed territory or the original territory voted has no effect on the “wet” or “dry” status of the annexed territory.

   <p class="p10">
    Every city of the first four classes that establishes home rule by compliance with subsection (1) of this section may only thereafter change its status by holding another separate, special local option election under subsection (1) of this section and, since it cannot hold such an election more often than once in every three (3) years, such city would not vote in a county-wide election where it had held an election establishing home rule within three (3) years; moreover, such city having independently determined its own local option status, the outcome of a county-wide election would not affect the city.

    The Karloftis v. Mills, 312 Ky. 722, 229 S.W.2d 477, 1950 Ky. LEXIS 746 (1950), case stands for the proposition that every city of the first four (4) classes may independently determine its own local option status and thus establish home rule and therefore, every city of the first four (4) classes in a dry county must separately and independently establish home rule under subsection (1) of this section and because one city has made an independent determination of its local option status and established home rule under the statute, this does not automatically establish home rule for any other such city similarly situated. OAG 76-624.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where a city of the first four (4) classes has established home rule by conducting a local option election in which it votes in favor of prohibition, it will thereafter always independently determine its own local option status under subsection (1) of this section and KRS 242.200 and in the event prohibition is repealed in a local option election held in the county, the outcome of the county election will not affect the city. OAG 76-624.

    Where, subsequent to local option election in city in which city voted “wet,” territory was annexed to city, application for a malt beverage license should have been denied since the annexed territory encompassing the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was being sought remained “dry” after becoming annexed to the city and an election would have to be held in the entire precinct encompassing the annexed territory and therefore in the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was sought in order to redetermine the local option status of the annexed territory, including the business location in question.

   <p class="p10">
    The annexation of the dry territory into the wet city precinct creates an enlarged precinct with both wet and dry areas, which is located within a “wet” city, and which may conduct a precinct election, and if the majority of voters are opposed to prohibition, convert the territory into an entirely “wet” precinct. OAG 79-382.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where a county has previously held a county-wide local option election at which it voted in favor of prohibition, a fourth-class city located within that county is a separate territorial unit under subsection (1) of this section for the purpose of determining its status on the issue of prohibition, and the city may proceed immediately with a city-wide local option election without waiting for three years as specified in subsection (5) of KRS 242.030. OAG 81-271.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where a city previously held a local option election which resulted in the city being designated a “wet territory” despite the fact that two (2) precincts voted for prohibition and where a small portion of a “dry” county was then annexed to one (1) of the two (2) precincts which had voted for prohibition, the annexed territory assumed the “wet” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (2) of KRS 242.190; however, a local option election could then be held to determine the “wet” or “dry” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, despite the prior city-wide election. OAG 81-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Since subsection (1) of this section authorizes a local option election in any city of the first four (4) classes in a dry county, but does not provide for separate voting by such cities when a county-wide election is called in a dry county, the votes for a fourth-class city could not be tabulated separately from the remaining county votes outside the corporate limits of the city. OAG 82-534.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where a county-wide local option election was held in a county that was dry prior to and remained dry after the election, even though a majority of the votes within a city were against prohibition, the provisions of KRS 242.220 to 242.430 were applicable to the city and such city could immediately proceed with a separate local option election pursuant to subsection (1) of this section to take the sense of the people as to discontinuance of prohibition within the city. OAG 82-534.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Local option elections are within state “licensing and regulatory laws” for which an included city should be deemed to exist even after the adoption of an urban-county form of government. Therefore, the county unit rule would still apply to all of a county outside of that city, which would remain an independent unit for purposes of local option elections. The urban-county government charter may provide that future local option elections will not be bound by the “county unit” rule. OAG 88-40.

The remaining three (3) licenses may be granted to a hotel, motel, or inn meeting the requirements of this section or to bona fide restaurants open to the general public having dining facilities for not less than one hundred (100) persons.

The regulatory license fee may be levied at the beginning of each city budget period at the percentage rate reasonably estimated to fully reimburse the city for the estimated costs of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expenses related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any other taxes, fees, or licenses permitted by law, but a credit against the fee shall be allowed in an amount equal to any licenses or fees imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070.

    The governing body receives a petition signed by a number of constitutionally qualified voters of a precinct equal to thirty-three percent (33%) of the votes cast in the precinct at the last preceding general election requesting the governing body of the city to designate the precinct as a limited sale precinct. The petition may consist of one (1) or more separate units and shall be filed with the mayor of the city.

    A private club would not be in violation of this section in allowing its adult club members to bring their own alcoholic beverages into the club for their own personal consumption as the mere possession of legally produced, legally possessed and legally purchased alcoholic beverages by a person at least 21 years of age for his “own personal consumption” is not in violation of this section.

    Although there is no specific quantity of alcoholic beverages that serves as a line of demarcation between unlawful possession or transportation of such beverages for the purpose of sale and lawful possession or transportation, as covered by this section, and each case must rest on its own particular facts, evidence of transportation of a large quantity of alcoholic beverages in dry territory raises an inference that such beverage was not possessed for personal or other legitimate use and is sufficient to support a conviction of the offense of transporting such beverages for the purpose of sale. OAG 76-279.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Any messenger or delivery service used to acquire alcoholic beverages to be transported into dry territory would be in direct violation of this section, regardless of whose money was used to purchase the beverages and regardless of ownership. OAG 79-389.

    The drinking of alcoholic beverages in a private club, whether in a wet or dry county, is not a crime; this section only prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages when that possession is for the purpose of sale in a dry territory or the possession has been unlawfully acquired. OAG 84-185.

    This section, to be applicable, involves possession for the purpose of trafficking in liquor in dry territory; thus liquor lawfully acquired and lawfully used is outside of this prohibition. OAG 84-185.

    When liquor is discovered on premises not owned by the accused there must be some evidence of substance “connecting” the accused with it. Marcum v. Commonwealth, 411 S.W.2d 462, 1967 Ky. LEXIS 474 (Ky. 1967).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Proof that liquor was sold at a time when the defendant was absent from Kentucky was not sufficient to destroy the inference that the establishment was “doing business as usual” with the full knowledge and consent of the defendant in violation of the local option law.

   <p class="p10">
    Where the accused is indicted as a second offender of a similar misdemeanor and there is evidence supporting the accusation, the instructions should permit the jury to return three possible verdicts: (1) not guilty; (2) guilty of the particular or principal offense charged; or (3) guilty of a second or third violation of the law as the case may be. Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 331 S.W.2d 891, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 11 (Ky. 1959), overruled,

   <p class="p10">
    Instruction requiring finding that appellant had committed a prime offense and that he had been convicted of local option offenses on two other occasions but failing to permit a finding that he had been guilty of a similar offense only one time before held erroneous. Marcum v. Commonwealth, 398 S.W.2d 886, 1966 Ky. LEXIS 518 (Ky. 1966), overruled,

    Where indictment charged illegal sale of alcoholic beverages it was error to instruct on the illegal possession of liquor for the purpose of sale. Spears v. Commonwealth, 399 S.W.2d 693, 1966 Ky. LEXIS 473 (Ky. 1966).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where the defendant’s entire defense was based upon the tenet that she had no knowledge whatever that liquor was being maintained on her premises and that it was brought there without her knowledge or consent, the failure of the court to affirmatively instruct the jury so as to encompass this theory of defense was error.

   </h4>
   <p class="p10">
    Although quarterly courts have concurrent jurisdiction with Circuit Courts of offenses under the local option law, appeal from judgment of conviction in quarterly court must be to circuit court and not directly to Court of Appeals. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 297 Ky. 513, 180 S.W.2d 414, 1944 Ky. LEXIS 762 (Ky. 1944).
   </p>

    Where a notice of appeal was filed in the Circuit Court on the date the Circuit Court’s order was entered but no notice was filed in the Court of Appeals or served on the other parties and the record was not filed within 30 days, the motion for appeal was overruled. Embry v. Commonwealth, 423 S.W.2d 523, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 486 (Ky. 1968).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Where defendant was seeking to prohibit the Circuit Court from trying him on an indictment under this section on the ground that his prior conviction was in a magistrate court and therefore void, prohibition did not lie since, in the event that the defendant was unsuccessful in persuading the Circuit Court to strike this count of the indictment, defendant had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to the Court of Appeals. Barnes v. Ashcraft, 490 S.W.2d 484, 1973 Ky. LEXIS 632 (Ky. 1973).

    The police court of a fifth-class city has jurisdiction in local option cases. OAG 63-754.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    A judge of the police court of a fourth-class city can probate the jail sentence in a local option violation case so long as he follows the provisions of KRS 439.550. OAG 66-84.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    In local option violations where the quarterly court and justices of the peace have concurrent jurisdiction, the quarterly court should try the case if that was the court before which the defendant was first brought. OAG 67-39.

   <p class="p10">
    The justice court has no authority, where a second or third offense is involved, to reduce the charge to a first offense. OAG 70-623.

    The justices’ courts only have jurisdiction of the first offense under this section. OAG 70-623.

    This section provides a mandatory jail sentence and a fine for natural persons pleading guilty to or who are convicted of a violation of KRS 242.230, but the justice court may, under KRS 439.550, probate the jail sentence, provided that the requirements of the latter statute are met. OAG 70-623.

    Since the quarterly court has no jurisdiction in “second offense” cases, the quarterly court has no jurisdiction or authority to pass on any preliminary motion in such a case. OAG 71-119.

    The quarterly court has no jurisdiction of second offense cases involving violations of KRS ch. 242. OAG 71-119.

   <p class="p10">
    An inferior court may probate a defendant as a first or second offender under subsection (1) of this section by suspending judgment as to the fine and the jail sentence provided that all the stautory conditions of KRS 439.550 are met. OAG 72-221.

    (7/15/2020). This statute was amended by
    2020 Ky. Acts chs. 80 and
    102, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.

   <p class="p10">
    (7/15/2016). A reference to “KRS 243.895” in this statute has been changed in codification to read “KRS 243.890.” In
    2016 Ky. Acts ch. 80, sec. 5, subsection (8)(b)2. refers to “tax collections imposed pursuant to
    KRS 243.710 to
    243.895.” It is obvious from the context that the citation of this range should not include the final section,
    KRS 243.895, which is a statute on an unrelated topic. Under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has inserted the correct reference.

    The in-person requirement in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is unconstitutional as it discriminates in practical effect against out-of-state small farm wineries and has not been shown to advance the legitimate local purposes asserted that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.

    The limit in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and 244.165(2)(c) of shipments to two cases of wine per customer per visit to the winery is evenhanded, as nothing on the face of the statute favors in-state over out-of-state wineries with respect to the two-case limit.

    Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted quota of retail package liquor licenses which quota was filled, nonsuccessful applicants who were admittedly qualified and to whose application no protest was made had standing to appeal administrator’s refusal to grant them licenses; however, trial court’s error in finding that there was no appeal from such refusal was harmless since the quota of licenses had been filled and the appeal would thus be an exercise in futility.

    The law prohibits an arbitrary selection or rejection of applicants for licenses and requires the exercise of sound discretion in such action and, since a lottery system is an arbitrary method of rejecting or selecting an application and involves no discretion, this method is not permitted under the law.

    Any licensee selling malt beverages to customers at a price which does not match, if not exceed, his “cost,” as defined in KRS 365.030(3), is in violation of KRS 365.030(1), assuming sales below cost are for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition. Assuming the retail price does not reflect the cost factors specified by statute, two remedies are available: first, the violator will be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment pursuant to KRS 365.990(2); second, the violator’s license may be revoked pursuant to this section.

If the board deems a violation of KRS 365.050 to be a sufficient cause for revocation of a license, a show cause hearing may be held to determine if such violation has in fact occurred. OAG 82-479.

    Legislature did not contemplate administrative punishment of unlicensed parties because it failed to provide non-licensees with any appellate remedy of a decision by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board; nowhere in KRS 243.560, nor any other statute in KRS Chs. 241 to 244, is appellate review of the Board’s decision mentioned in the context of a non-licensee who has been aggrieved by the imposition of administrative fines.

   <p class="p10">
    The Legislature never intended an appeal under this section by an aggrieved citizen, who is not an applicant, from an order of the board granting the application for a liquor license; the citizen is heard by filing a “protest” under the provision of KRS 243.360 on the granting of a license.

    Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sales of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted 21 retail package liquor licenses, nonapplicant aggrieved citizens could allege no violation of any property rights and thus they had no standing to complain against actions of administrator and board in granting the licenses.

    Under KRS 241.200, a liquor store owner was an aggrieved citizen entitled to an administrative hearing on an applicant’s request for liquor license; therefore, the trial court properly remanded the case to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the city administrator’s issuance of the license violated KRS 243.450 because the applicant’s premises did not comply with the city’s regulations.

Acts ch. 102, sec. 18, amended KRS 243.884, following a free conference committee for HB 445 to “adjust the tax rates on beer and wine.” In this amendment the internal numbering of KRS 243.884 was changed and subsection (2) was renumbered as subsection (3). An existing reference within KRS 243.884 to “subsection (3) of this section” was changed to “subsection (2)”. However this conforming change was not made to another statute, KRS 243.882(1), which refers to “KRS 243.884(2).” The Reviser of Statutes has made this change to KRS 243.882(1) under the authority of KRS 7.136.

    1982 Senate Journal 2026. In this substitute, Section 4 had two subsections. Floor Amendment No. 4 to this substitute deleted subsection (1) of Section 4 and removed (2) from the remainder of the text.

    Although KRS 243.130 specifically prohibited promotional activities for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the part of distillers, rectifiers and vintners and this section prohibited similar activities by any retail licensee but there was no statute prohibiting such activities on the part of brewers and beer distributors, the alcoholic beverage control board was not authorized to adopt a regulation prohibiting the promotion of alcoholic beverage brands by brewers and distributors in retail stores for enactment of specific statutory legislation in the field as to distillers, rectifiers, vintners and retail licensees dispels any notion that the Legislature impliedly delegated to the board power to legislate similarly to brewers and beer distributors.

    Sale below “cost,” as defined in KRS 365.030(3), is not the equivalent of giving away alcoholic beverages for less than a “full monetary consideration” as prohibited by KRS 244.050; so long as the retail sales price to the customer matches or exceeds the replacement price on the date of sale (i.e., fair market value) or his original purchase price, whichever is lower, the retailer receives “full monetary consideration.” Had the legislature intended that “full monetary consideration” include the retailer’s costs, it would have explicitly provided for such requirement in this section, as it did in KRS Ch. 365.

    The Commerce Clause does not require that out-of-state wineries be granted the exact same economic advantages as in-state wineries; however, the in-person requirement as it operates under KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is protectionist and cannot stand. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93266 (W.D. Ky. 2006), aff'd, 553 F.3d 423, 2008 FED App. 0458P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 26086 (6th Cir. Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The in-person requirement in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is unconstitutional as it discriminates in practical effect against out-of-state small farm wineries and has not been shown to advance the legitimate local purposes asserted that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93266 (W.D. Ky. 2006), aff'd, 553 F.3d 423, 2008 FED App. 0458P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 26086 (6th Cir. Ky. 2008).

   <p class="p10">
    The limit in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and 244.165(2)(c) of shipments to two cases of wine per customer per visit to the winery is evenhanded, as nothing on the face of the statute favors in-state over out-of-state wineries with respect to the two-case limit. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93266 (W.D. Ky. 2006), aff'd, 553 F.3d 423, 2008 FED App. 0458P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 26086 (6th Cir. Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Twenty-first Amendment’s grant of virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system renders the two-case limitation for small farm wineries under KRS 243.155 and KRS 244.165 easily justified. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93266 (W.D. Ky. 2006), aff'd, 553 F.3d 423, 2008 FED App. 0458P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 26086 (6th Cir. Ky. 2008).

    The two-case quantity limitation written into KRS 244.165 does not burden interstate commerce. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93266 (W.D. Ky. 2006), aff'd, 553 F.3d 423, 2008 FED App. 0458P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 26086 (6th Cir. Ky. 2008).

    No retailer selling distilled spirits and wine by the package or by the drink shall sell, deliver, or give away, or cause, permit or procure to be sold, delivered, or given away any distilled spirits or wine on credit, except that a bona fide licensed private club, restaurant, or hotel may sell on reasonable credit to its members, customers, or registered guests. Sales by any retailer selling distilled spirits or wine by the package or by the drink may be made by use of national or bank credit cards wherein the credit card company has agreed to payment to the licensee for such charges.

    The legality of a retailer’s proposal to sell alcoholic beverages on a “lay-away” plan depends upon whether the terms of the “lay-away” plan at the outset involve a contract to sell rather than a present sale, with title passing on payment and delivery. If the transaction represents a contract to sell on the part of the retailer or an option to purchase on the part of the customer-purchaser, title has not passed and no binding sale for credit has occurred; on the other hand, if the lay-away plan involves a present sale with only payment and delivery postponed, the retailer-seller would clearly have completed a sale and passed title without receiving full remuneration thereby violating this section.

    The underwriting of a $50,000 stakes race purse at a race track by a brewery company did not violate this section since it was the manufacturer and not the licensee, which was offering the “prize” and, the prize was not offered “in connection with the sale of malt beverages,” inasmuch as the purchase of such beverages was not required of persons who wished to participate in the race. Although the event might build goodwill for the brewery company thereby indirectly increasing sales of its product, the relationship between the prize and the purchase of the brewery’s products was so remote as to remove the event from the scope of this section.

    Whether the vertical restraint created by this section violates the antitrust laws would depend on whether the restraint poses a significant injury to competition and the anti-competitive conduct clearly overrides any procompetitive redeeming benefit. OAG 82-514.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    In enacting this section, the 1982 General Assembly clearly articulated its policy to supplant the free and open market determination of distributor arrangements by requiring a written agreement between the distributor and brewer or supplier which defines the distributor’s exclusive territory; however, the section fails to provide for adequate state supervision over this policy since the determination of the exclusive territories is accomplished by private parties rather than by the state and the state does not regulate or “police” the enforcement of these exclusive territorial arrangements entered into by private parties. Thus, even though the exclusive territories for distributors are required by this section, the arrangements are not immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine; whether the conduct contemplated by the section violates the antitrust laws would depend upon the factual circumstances surrounding the particular arrangement and the existence of an illegal restraint of trade. OAG 82-514.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    This section represents a vertical restraint between the brewer or supplier and the distributor by confining the distributor to a particular area of operation (plus various other restrictions relating to sale and quality control); these vertical nonprice restraints contained the potential to promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of his products and, moreover, society’s increasing demand that manufacturers directly assume responsibility for the safety and quality of their products constitutes a legitimate reason or justification for manufacturer control over the manner in which his product is sold. Accordingly, there is a rational relationship, for equal protection purposes, between the classification and the objectives justifying it; the statute also withstands a due process analysis in that it bears a reasonable relationship to the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages. OAG 82-514.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    In order to effectuate the intent of this section and to construe subsection (3) of this section in harmony with the other subsections, the phrase “brewer and supplier” in the last sentence of subsection (3) must be interpreted as “brewer or supplier” and thus subsection (3) must be interpreted to require the prior written approval of the supplier or brewer for the sale of a particular brand of malt beverage.
