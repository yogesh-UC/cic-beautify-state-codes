That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

    The Board of Trustees of the Kentucky Judicial Form Retirement System was prohibited from deducting from retirement benefits, being drawn by retired judge, a sum representing benefits which had been previously paid to him during an earlier period of retirement since judges serve in Kentucky for terms to which they are elected, and their return to active service following a period of retirement is an easily foreseeable circumstance; therefore, if the Legislature had intended that benefits be recouped in that event, it could have so provided, but did not so provide.

    (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky.

    In the absence of any legal relationship between the Judicial Retirement System and its ex-member the fact that the latter may subsequently obtain service credit in another state retirement system would not entitle him to count that service credit toward vesting in the Judicial Retirement System. OAG 78-538.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since there is no legal obligation on the part of the Judicial Retirement System to an ex-member who does not demand a refund, the contributions then being held by the Judicial Retirement System do not constitute or reflect service credit in that system, and, at best, the contributions simply constitute an amount of money belonging to the ex-member which he has left in the hands of the Judicial Retirement System.

    (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

    As a pilot project to determine the effectiveness of using senior retired judges to combat backlog and delay in Kentucky courts, there is hereby created a “Senior Status Program for Special Judges.” The program shall be implemented as follows:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    KRS 21.400(1) and any other provision in KRS Chapter 21 to the contrary notwithstanding, a member who retires at a time when combining his total years of judicial service credit and his age equals or exceeds the number seventy-five (75), may elect, within ninety (90) days following retirement, to participate in the “Senior Status Program for Special Judges,” if he complies with the provisions of this subsection. In that event, the member shall be entitled to a service retirement allowance, commencing at the member’s normal retirement age, payable monthly during his lifetime in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of his final compensation multiplied by the number of years of his judicial service, not to exceed twenty (20) years of judicial service at the five percent (5%) factor, not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of final compensation. “Final compensation”, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, for all members retiring under any provision of KRS 21.345 to 21.570 or this section, or similar statutes governing the same positions, as defined in KRS 21.400 shall be based on a period of thirty-six (36) months. Any nonjudicial time shall be counted as is otherwise provided in KRS Chapter 21, but in no event shall service retirement allowance exceed one hundred percent (100%) of final compensation.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     1.
    </span>
    In the event the retiring judge elects to retire as a “Senior Status Special Judge” under this subsection, he shall commit to serve, upon appointment by the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, as special judge for one hundred twenty (120) work days per year for a term of five (5) years without compensation other than the retirement benefits under this subsection. The Senior Status Special Judge may agree to work more than one hundred twenty (120) days in any year within the five (5) years of service; however, the Senior Status Special Judge shall be compensated as otherwise provided by law, in addition to his retirement benefits, for any days served in excess of one hundred twenty (120) in that year. If the Senior Status Special Judge has not served a total of six hundred (600) days within the five (5) year period outlined in this subsection, the Chief Justice shall require the Senior Status Special Judge to serve at no additional compensation to the Senior Status Special Judge, until the six hundred (600) day period is served by the Senior Status Special Judge. The Senior Status Special Judge and the Chief Justice may agree in writing to serve less than the one hundred twenty (120) days in any one (1) or more of the five (5) years; however, any of the days not served in a given year shall be served at the end of the five (5) year period set forth in this subsection.

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     2.
    </span>
    Should any member electing to retire under the Senior Status Program for Special Judges fail, when ordered by the Chief Justice to serve the requisite number of days not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days a year for the five (5) year period outlined in this subsection, unless otherwise agreed in writing, he shall no longer be eligible for benefits computed under this subsection and shall return to the benefits otherwise provided under this chapter.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     3.
    </span>
    Subject to Section 110(5)(b) of the Kentucky Constitution, the Chief Justice shall give due regard, when practical, to the desirability of appointing Senior Status Special Judges to serve within their judicial region as defined by the regional administration charter.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    The inviolable contract provisions of Kentucky law, KRS 21.480, shall apply during the period of time that KRS 21.580 is effective; however, no other provisions of 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 305 shall be considered subject to an inviolable contract of the Commonwealth.

     (1)
    </span>
    Except as provided in Section 110 of the Constitution, an appeal may be taken as a matter of right to the Court of Appeals from any conviction, final judgment, order, or decree in any case in Circuit Court, including a family court division of Circuit Court, unless such conviction, final judgment, order, or decree was rendered on an appeal from a court inferior to Circuit Court.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders of the Circuit Court in civil cases, but only as authorized by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, there shall be no review by appeal or by writ of certiorari from that portion of a final judgment, order or decree of a Circuit Court dissolving a marriage.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    An appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals by the state in criminal cases from an adverse decision or ruling of the Circuit Court, but only under the following conditions:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    Such appeal shall not suspend the proceedings in the case.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    Such appeal shall be taken in the manner provided by the Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Rules of the Supreme Court, except that the record on appeal shall be transmitted by the clerk of the Circuit Court to the Attorney General; and if the Attorney General is satisfied that review by the Court of Appeals is important to the correct and uniform administration of the law, he may deliver the record to the clerk of the Court of Appeals within the time prescribed by the above-mentioned rules.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    When an appeal is taken pursuant to this subsection, the Court of Appeals, if the record so warrants, may reverse the decision of the Circuit Court and order a new trial in any case in which a new trial would not constitute double jeopardy or otherwise violate any constitutional rights of the defendant.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    Any party aggrieved by the judgment of the Circuit Court in a case appealed from a court inferior thereto may petition the Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari.

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    Since under §§ 109 and 116 of the Constitution the Supreme Court only has the power to prescribe rules governing appellate procedure and jurisdiction and since the only restriction on appeal by the Commonwealth set forth by the Constitution of Kentucky, as stated in § 115, is that the Commonwealth may not appeal from a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case for any purpose other than securing a certification of the law; therefore, when the legislature, by enactment of subsection (4) of this section, attempted to establish rules of appellate procedure, it acted contrary to the dictates of the Constitution. Commonwealth v. Schumacher, 566 S.W.2d 762, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 524 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978), disapproved, Commonwealth v. Littrell, 677 S.W.2d 881, 1984 Ky. LEXIS 285 (Ky. 1984).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a trial court’s decision was not a final order, KRS 22A.020(4) allowed the Commonwealth to take an interlocutory appeal. Section 22A.020(4) did not violate Ky. Const. § 2 even though it was solely for the benefit of the Commonwealth as it furthered the Commonwealth’s legitimate interest in the administration of justice. Ballard v. Commonwealth, 320 S.W.3d 69, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 206 (Ky. 2010).

    “Rendered on an appeal from a court inferior to Circuit Court” is construed as referring only to decisions of the Circuit Court made while sitting as an appellate review court, and not to those made sitting as a trial court.

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    A Commonwealth’s Attorney seeking an appeal of discretionary rulings within a trial court’s jurisdiction has a remedy under subsection (4) of this section and, in this connection, the term “proceedings” as used in subdivision (4)(a) of this section is construed as referring to proceedings after the attachment of jeopardy, so that, unless the constitutional right to a speedy trial were unduly threatened, there is no reason why an interlocutory “ruling” entered prior to trial, if it decides a matter vital to the Commonwealth’s case, could not be reviewed by appeal. Eaton v. Commonwealth, 562 S.W.2d 637, 1978 Ky. LEXIS 334 (Ky. 1978).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Whereas this section authorizes the Commonwealth to appeal from an interlocutory order, there is no comparable provision for an appeal by the defendant. Evans v. Commonwealth, 645 S.W.2d 346, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 330 (Ky. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section gives the Commonwealth the authority to appeal from interlocutory orders under certain conditions. Those conditions are that (a) the appeal will not stay the proceedings, and (b) the defendant’s constitutional rights to a speedy trial and against double jeopardy are not violated. Commonwealth v. Evans, 645 S.W.2d 350, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 280 (Ky. Ct. App.), aff'd, 645 S.W.2d 346, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 330 (Ky. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Supreme Court has construed subsection (4) of this section to permit an appeal of an interlocutory ruling only if the ruling decides a matter vital to the Commonwealth’s case; where the ruling vital to the prosecution’s case was the order suppressing evidence of the statements by the deceased officer, this order was properly appealable, but the ruling denying reconsideration did the prosecution no further damage and was not appealable. Commonwealth v. Cobb, 728 S.W.2d 540, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 472 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987), overruled in part, Parker v. Commonwealth, 440 S.W.3d 381, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 432 (Ky. 2014).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Unquestionably, this section provides for interlocutory appeals but only from Circuit Court, not to Circuit Court from District Court. The proper procedure for appeals from District Court is governed by KRS 23A.080. Tipton v. Commonwealth, 770 S.W.2d 239, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 38 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989), overruled in part, Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 2004), abrogated in part, Commonwealth v. Lamberson, 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 733 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    An interlocutory appeal by the Commonwealth does not require the continuance of pre-trial proceedings until the determination of the appeal and, therefore, the trial court did not improperly dismiss a criminal proceeding against the defendant where (1) the court issued an order stating that the case would be dismissed in 60 days if the Commonwealth did not proceed to trial; (2) the Commonwealth failed to seek intermediate relief from the Court of Appeals following entry of such order; and (3) the Commonwealth took no steps to avoid dismissal of the action. Commonwealth v. Blincoe, 33 S.W.3d 533, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 146 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Interlocutory appeal, under KRS 22A.020, may only be taken from a judgment or order that has been signed by the judge and service thereof noted on the docket by the Circuit Court clerk under RCr 12.04, RCr 12.06, and CR 58; to meet these requirements, it is axiomatic that the judgment or order appealed from be reduced to writing. Commonwealth v. West, 147 S.W.3d 72, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 197 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Oral interlocutory order was not an appealable order as it had not been signed by the judge and as no notation of service had been made on the docket. Commonwealth v. West, 147 S.W.3d 72, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 197 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Filing of an appeal in a negligence case did not divest a trial court of jurisdiction to enter a subsequent order because the appeal was an inappropriate interlocutory appeal; only certain appeals were timely and appropriately brought, pursuant to CR 73.02 and KRS 22A.020, 417.220. Moctar v. Yellow Cab of Louisville, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 175 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2012), review denied, ordered not published, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 431 (Ky. Sept. 18, 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    An order granting a subpoena duces tecum and requiring defendant to comply therewith was interlocutory and was not appealable, however, defendant could apply to the Court of Appeals for a writ of prohibition to prevent entry of the order. (Decided under prior law) Claussner Hosiery Co. v. Paducah, 275 Ky. 149, 120 S.W.2d 1039, 1938 Ky. LEXIS 386 (Ky. 1938).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Interlocutory judgments are such as are given in the middle of a cause, upon some plea, proceeding or default, which is only intermediate, and does not finally determine or complete the suit. Final judgments are such as at once put an end to the action by declaring that the plaintiff has or has not entitled himself to the remedy sued for. (Decided under prior law) Adkins v. Carol Mining Co., 281 Ky. 328, 136 S.W.2d 32, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 40 (Ky. 1940).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    An order sustaining or overruling a motion to quash the return of an officer on a summons is not a final order for the purposes of an appeal. (Decided under prior law) Bastian Bros. Co. v.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where, in a declaratory judgment action, the trial court sustained a demurrer to the petition and proceeded to make a declaration of rights, the plaintiff did not decline to plead further, and the petition was not dismissed, the ruling of the court was interlocutory and appeal was not proper. (Decided under prior law) Campbell v. Daugherty, 259 Ky. 372, 82 S.W.2d 460, 1935 Ky. LEXIS 322 (Ky. 1935).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Appellate court was not authorized by the Kentucky Constitution or statute to consider an appeal from an interlocutory order denying defendant immunity under this section because this section did not include a provision for allowing such an appeal.

    In a case involving the suppression of evidence, an appeal filed by the Commonwealth was timely, even though it was inappropriate for review under the civil rule for altering or amending a judgment, because the Commonwealth forfeited its motion before the trial court with an alternative request for findings of fact and conclusions of law under a rule of criminal procedure; the motion for findings under the rule of criminal procedure was treated as a motion under the rules of civil procedure seeking findings of fact, thus tolling the appeal period.

    Generally, state courts of general jurisdiction have

    The appropriate standard of review for a Circuit Court to employ when considering the actions of a Fiscal Court regarding the closing of a county road is limited to determining whether the decision not to close the road was arbitrary, including whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision. A trial de novo is expressly prohibited. Trimble Fiscal Court v. Snyder, 866 S.W.2d 124, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 154 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).

    “Original action” necessarily encompassed a trial de novo. A challenge to the Fiscal Court’s action must be designated an “original action,” because the Fiscal Court is not a judicial court, which precludes an “appeal” per se. Nonetheless, calling the proceeding an original action does not convert the review of a local legislative body’s decision into a trial de novo. Rather, the proper standard for review is that applicable to all such matters. Trimble Fiscal Court v. Snyder, 866 S.W.2d 124, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 154 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).

    The phrase, “may be authorized by law,” in subsection (4) of this section suggests that the review, which is not an appeal but an original action, is an inchoate authority and requires some further and positive legislative act or rule of the Supreme Court of Kentucky to permit such original actions.

    KRS 61.170 requires an indictment by a Circuit Court grand jury in order to charge the offense of malfeasance or neglect of county officers; but since KRS 24A.110 vests exclusive jurisdiction of misdemeanor cases, generally, in the District Court, the Circuit Court in which such an indictment is returned has necessarily, because of the jurisdictional statute, the authority and duty to refer the indictment for trial or other appropriate disposition to the district court of that county.

   <p class="p7">
    Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and 178.115, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a Circuit Court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal can be taken from a fiscal court order to the District Court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction.

    Former section was the general law on the subject of appeals from inferior courts in certain cases, but it did not control where there was a special law governing the particular kind of appeal to be prosecuted.

   <p class="p7">
    The Legislature did not intend anything significant by the word “Action” instead of “judgment” or its equivalent. The emphasis is on the word “final”; so the legislature did not authorize interlocutory orders to be reviewable by direct appeal. Tipton v. Commonwealth, 770 S.W.2d 239, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 38 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989), overruled in part, Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 2004), abrogated in part, Commonwealth v. Lamberson, 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 733 (Ky. Ct.

   <p class="p7">
    As a Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to take an interlocutory appeal from the District Court, and the Commonwealth would suffer irreparable harm if the District Court’s order suppressing the results of a breathalyzer test was enforced, the mandamus was the proper means for the Circuit Court to redress the District Court judge’s error. Billingsley v. Commonwealth, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 162 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2004 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 929 (Ky. Ct. App. June 4, 2004).

    In habeas corpus proceeding for release from county jail on ground that judgment was void because trial commissioner had no legal authority or power and defendant was convicted of five charges but tried on only one, defendant instead of appealing denial of writ of habeas corpus to Court of Appeals should have exhausted his remedy of appeal to the Circuit Court where the case would have been tried de novo and question of lack of judicial authority in presiding judge and trial on multiple charges would have been eliminated.

   <p class="p7">
    Circuit court had authority to issue a writ of prohibition to a district court judge who had issued an order precluding all county attorneys from objecting to questions made to defense witnesses during a preliminary hearing because the Kentucky Supreme Court was not the proper forum and access of such matters to the circuit court provided the parties with rapid and easy access to address claims of immediate and irreparable harm. Delahanty v. Commonwealth ex rel. Maze, 295 S.W.3d 136, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 124 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal because the order did not dispose of the ultimate issue, i.e., whether defendant was guilty of DUI, nor did it include finality language. Peters v. Commonwealth, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 2 (Ky. Ct. App. Jan. 8, 2010), rev'd, 353 S.W.3d 592, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 140 (Ky. 2011).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Even though the Commonwealth showed that there was an inadequate remedy by appeal and that it would have suffered great and irreparable injury if a trial court erred by suppressing a juvenile’s statement, a writ of prohibition was not appropriate for the State in a sodomy case because the 13-year-old juvenile’s statement given to police at a school was properly suppressed as involuntary in nature; although a 32-minute interrogation did not seem excessive, the repetitive questioning amounted to coercion by importunity. Even though Miranda rights were read, the juvenile was ordered by school officials into a room, he faced authority figures with considerable power who feigned superior knowledge, and they repeatedly demanded answers. Commonwealth v. Bell, 365 S.W.3d 216, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 55 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Circuit court properly denied the a writ of prohibition seeking to prohibit the district court from suppressing the results of defendant’s breathalyzer test in the DUI case under KRS 189A.010(1)(b) because, although the Commonwealth had no adequate remedy by appeal and would suffer great and irreparable injury, the evidence showed that defendant did not intend to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated but, rather, that he had returned to his vehicle after an evening of merry-making, entered his vehicle, and started it to warm himself while he sobered. Commonwealth v. Armstrong, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 40 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2013), review denied, ordered not published, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 694 (Ky. Dec. 11, 2013).

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the district court’s denial of the Commonwealth’s motion to transfer appellant juvenile’s robbery case to the circuit court did not dispose of the ultimate issue in the case concerning appellant’s guilt, there was no finality within the meaning of RCr P. 54.02(1); therefore, the Commonwealth’s only remedy was to petition for a writ of mandamus. The circuit court did not err by granting a petition for writ of mandamus under KRS 23A.080(2) directing the district court to transfer appellant’s robbery case to the circuit court, because the conditions of KRS 635.020(4) were satisfied; appellant was older than 14 years of age and a participant in a crime in which a gun was used. K.N. v. Commonwealth, 375 S.W.3d 816, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 89 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus because the Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal; the district court's denial of the motion to transfer defendant juvenile to circuit court was an interlocutory order because further proceedings were necessary in district court to dispose of all the issues in the case.

    A direct appeal may be taken from District Court to Circuit Court from any final action of the District Court. OAG 78-190.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Jurisdiction to order the return to defendant of personal property seized for forfeiture does not vest in any court until there has been a conviction. Until that time, property is not subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of the appropriate law enforcement agency. The Commonwealth may hold property which may be subject to forfeiture under the penal code until the underlying criminal charges have been resolved, and upon conviction subject the property to forfeiture. A district court order directing that personal property seized incident to an arrest or by execution of a search warrant be returned to the defendant is not a final action, so a direct appeal would not be available. Rather, review, if any, would be available through an original proceeding for relief in the nature of mandamus or prohibition in the Circuit Court pursuant to the authority of SCR 1.040(6), CR 81 and subsection (2) of this section.

    Former husband’s breach of oral contract complaint was properly dismissed by Circuit Court; the complaint was an attempt to collaterally attack a property settlement from a dissolution action over which the family division had exclusive jurisdiction under KRS 23A.100. Bush v. Combest, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 293 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Trial court erred in treating a father’s exceptions to a commissioner’s child custody recommendations as a CR 59.05 motion and
    by transferring the case to a Family Court because the recommendation was not a final judgment; rather, the trial court should have simply reviewed the exceptions, conducted a hearing, and entered a final judgment adjudicating the custody issue. The Family Court’s jurisdiction over domestic issues was not intended to be exclusive. Pursley v. Pursley, 242 S.W.3d 346, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 457 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    While KRS 23A.100(2)(b) conferred general jurisdiction of the trial on a Family Court division for paternity proceedings, the Kentucky paternity statutes did not apply to grant subject matter jurisdiction to Kentucky courts to determine a paternity claim where there was no evidence or allegation that the marital relationship ceased 10 months before the child’s birth. Pursuant to KRS 406.011 a child born during lawful wedlock, or within 10 months thereafter, was presumed to be the husband and wife’s child. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 2008), overruled in part, J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Family court erred in declining to make findings that a child satisfied the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act that could enable her to acquire special immigrant status because the fact-finding process fell squarely within its jurisdiction to provide an adequate remedy for the child, who had been adjudged to be dependent and whose substantial rights were affected by such findings or lack thereof. N.B.D. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 248 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2018), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2018).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In keeping with its independence from the federal immigration process, the family court is fully authorized as the finder of fact to conclude under Kentucky law that a petitioner has failed to present evidence to support the special immigrant factors or that the evidence presented was not credible. N.B.D. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 248 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2018), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2018).

    Court of Appeals erred in reversing a family court decision declining to conduct a Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) hearing at the disposition phase of a dependency, neglect, and abuse case regarding an unaccompanied Guatemalan minor because, while the minor was a dependent child and entitled to the protection and care of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the courts of Kentucky were not required to make additional findings related to SIJ classification unless they first determine that the evidence to be gleaned from such a supplemental hearing was relevant to the child’s best interests, and there were also grave concerns about the use of the juvenile process in the case to circumvent federal immigration law. Commonwealth v. N.B.D., 577 S.W.3d 73, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 209 (Ky. 2019), cert. denied, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 3427 (U.S. June 29, 2020).

    Where the estate of a decedent filed a complaint for determination of paternity of a child allegedly fathered by the decedent, although the Family Court did not have jurisdiction over a paternity action under KRS 406.021 or KRS 406.180, as the estate was not the proper party to file such a suit, and neither the child nor mother ever lived in the United States, the court had jurisdiction under KRS 418.040 to enter a declaratory judgment as to the child’s paternity.

    Contrary to a husband’s arguments, the fact that a District Court declined to issue an emergency protective order did not leave a Family Court without jurisdiction to issue a domestic violence order subsequent to a hearing on a wife’s petition; under KRS 23A.100(3), the Family Court was the primary forum for cases involving domestic violence and abuse although the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction to enter protective orders under KRS 403.725.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Court of appeals erred in holding that a family court lost jurisdiction to issue a domestic violence order on the ground that it failed to conduct a hearing within 14 days after the issuance of an emergency protective order because the family court’s failure was, at most, the erroneous exercise of subject matter jurisdiction; it was not a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under KRS 23A.100(2).

    When a family court judge recused in a divorce action, she simultaneously and automatically disqualified herself from a domestic violence order proceeding as the very purpose for the creation of the family courts was to consolidate litigation and controversies related to a family into one court.

   <p class="p7">
    In accordance with KRS 23A.100(2)(b), the family court had jurisdiction over an action to establish paternity to a child conceived while a married couple was legally separated and pursuing a divorce; given the unusual facts of this case and the inherent rights of biological parents, the grant of joint custody to appellant former husband could not prevent appellee alleged biological father from pursuing his paternity action. The family court had jurisdiction to make the proper balancing of the parties’
    rights and determine the best interests of the child. Smith v. Garber, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 142 (Ky.), sub. op., 2010 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 115 (Ky. June 17, 2010).

   <p class="p7">
    Mother was estopped from arguing that KRS 406.180 limited jurisdiction to children born “out of wedlock.” The mother and her husband judicially admitted that another man was the father of a child born during the marriage, and diagnostic testing confirmed the other man’s paternity; the mother’s judicial admissions were sufficient to rebut the presumption that her husband was the father of the child.

    To apply the provisions of this section to suits filed prior to January 2, 1978, would make the statute retroactive in its application; since there is no provision or indication in the statute or in the bill enacting the statute that such an objective was intended and since KRS 446.080(3) states that no statute shall be construed to be retroactive, unless expressly so declared the filing fee requirement is applicable only to suits filed on and after January 2, 1978.

    Statute allowing for costs to be assessed after sentencing, KRS 23A.205, allowed for court costs to be waived for “poor persons,” as defined in KRS 453.190(2), but did not give defendant the blanket immunity from costs that defendant suggested was required by KRS 31.110. Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant.

   <p class="p7">
    Trial court's imposition of court costs and the arrest fee was affirmed where the record did not reflect an assessment of appellant's financial status, other than that he was appointed a public defender and permitted to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, and simply because appellant was represented by a public defender did not mean he was necessarily exempt from court costs. Spicer v. Commonwealth, 442 S.W.3d 26, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 435 (Ky. 2014).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Assessment of court costs was facially valid and did not constitute error, as the court expressly imposed court costs and made provisions for deferred payment, without finding that defendant was a “poor person.” Nunn v. Commonwealth, 461 S.W.3d 741, 2015 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2015).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In a drug case, there was no error in requiring defendant to pay court costs because, even though defendant stated he did not believe he had money in a commissary account, the trial court did not find him to be a poor person. The trial court found that defendant would have been able to earn money to pay the nominal court costs after his release from prison. Hunt v. Commonwealth, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 65 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016).

    There was no method by which a trial court could indirectly impose fines under KRS 534.040(4) and court costs under KRS 23A.205(2) against a defendant by reducing his pretrial jail time credit; therefore, language in the judgment that could be taken to indicate that such credit would be reduced was ordered stricken. Smith v. Commonwealth, 366 S.W.3d 399, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 27 (Ky. 2012).

    Court reversed the imposition of court costs and remanded for a finding whether defendant was a poor person, as defined in KRS 453.190(2), was unable to pay court costs, and would be unable to pay the court costs in the foreseeable future.

    Decision to impose or waive court costs was to be made by the trial court by or at the time of sentencing; there was no statutory basis for a court to exercise jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of court costs beyond the end of the proceedings, much less once the sentence has been imposed and served and the defendant has been released from prison. Buster v. Commonwealth, 381 S.W.3d 294, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 162 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Appellant was ordered to pay costs and fees immediately upon release from custody, and he was facing an over seven-year sentence during which he could not work; thus, there was not a reasonable basis to find that appellant would soon be able to pay costs, and that part of the order imposing costs and fees was vacated. Butler v. Commonwealth, 367 S.W.3d 609, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    While the trial court provided defendant with a six-month period of time to pay the court costs once he was released from incarceration, there was no indication in the record that the court made any findings regarding whether defendant was “poor” and whether he could presently or in the foreseeable future pay the court costs as required by KRS 23A.205. McElroy v. Commonwealth, 389 S.W.3d 130, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 292 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The trial court's imposition of court costs under this section was unreasonable and constituted palpable error, as defendant had no job, asserts, or income, was facing a three and one-half year prison sentence, had nothing but a phone card while in jail, and was specifically found to be indigent under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 453.190 shortly after sentencing. Jones v. Commonwealth, 527 S.W.3d 820, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 442 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

    Imposition of court costs was reversed and the case was remanded for a determination of whether defendant was a poor person as defined by KRS 453.190(2), unable to pay court costs now, and would be unable to pay court costs in the foreseeable future as court costs could be imposed on an indigent defendant, unless the court found that the defendant was a poor person as defined by KRS 453.190(2) and that he or she was unable to pay court costs and would be unable to pay the court costs in the foreseeable future under KRS 23A.205.

    Prior to imposing court costs, the trial court issued no finding on whether defendant was a poor person and did not inquire into his ability to pay cost in the future, and such constituted reversible error; the was a question of fact to be determine by the trial court on remand.

    Because an inmate timely tendered a notice of appeal with the proper filing fees, payment of the court facility fees was not a condition precedent, and failure to tender the court facility fee within the time limits of CR 73.02(1)(a) did not require automatic dismissal of the appeal. Moreover, the trial court could issue a show cause order to ensure the court facility fee was paid. Hill v. Ky. Parole Bd., 250 S.W.3d 314, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 104 (Ky. 2008).

    Contrary to arguments by a husband who was the subject of a domestic violence order, a District Court was a court of limited jurisdiction and nothing within KRS ch. 24A gave District Courts exclusive jurisdiction in domestic violence proceedings. Under KRS 403.725, the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction with Family Courts for the issuance of domestic violence orders. Gomez v. Gomez, 254 S.W.3d 838, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct.

    In view of the fact that the District Judge must be available at all times to issue civil or criminal process and the fact that his is a court of continuous session, a person could not carry on the work of a District Judge and be a master commissioner at the same time. OAG 77-186.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    While prosecution as an habitual violator of the motor vehicle laws is not a criminal prosecution, it clearly comes under the jurisdiction of the District Court. OAG 78-177.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and 178.115, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a Circuit Court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal can be taken from a fiscal court order to the District Court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The enacting of an ordinance which contains provisions regarding the jurisdiction of the District Court which are identical to the provisions found in the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, KRS 383.505 to 383.715, would not be an enlargement of the court’s jurisdiction and would not, therefore, invalidate such an ordinance. OAG 83-251.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a District Court has found, as a result of a preliminary hearing proceeding, that probable cause exists to believe that a felony has been committed, but a grand jury has not yet returned an indictment, the District Court does not have the authority to order that personal property seized incident to the arrest or by execution of a search warrant be returned to the defendant. OAG 91-67.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Unless a District Court, upon a showing of good cause, amends a felony charge to a misdemeanor or finds a lack of probable cause and releases the defendant from custody, its sole authority with respect to a felony charge is the authority to examine the charge and determine whether to commit the defendant to jail or hold him to bail or other form of pre-trial release. OAG 91-67.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. This section, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence. OAG 91-67.

   <p class="p7">
    A person would be prohibited from holding the office of trial commissioner, which is a state office, while at the same time serving as county judge/executive. OAG 77-661.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no authority under this section for the appointment of a judge pro tem of the District Court or the appointment of a pro tem trial commissioner. OAG 77-661.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since the position of trial commissioner is a state office and membership on the county election board is a county office, an individual would be prohibited from holding both positions at the same time by Const., § 165 and KRS 61.080. OAG 80-266.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county sheriff must execute and make due return on all criminal process lawfully issued by a county trial commissioner (process as authorized by SCR 5.030) and placed in the sheriff’s hands or with his lawful deputies. OAG 80-332.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The positions of deputy circuit clerk, a state officer under KRS 30A.010, and trial commissioner of the county District Court, a state officer under this section are compatible with one another, since neither Const., § 165, nor KRS 61.080 prohibits a person from holding two state offices at the same time; however, they may be incompatible under the doctrine of practical or common law. OAG 81-124.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A lawyer who represents defendants in criminal cases cannot also be appointed to the position of trial commissioner pursuant to this section and Const., § 113, since the judicial functions of the trial commissioner are inherently inconsistent and repugnant to the role of a defense attorney in criminal cases, and, in addition, the trial commissioner of one district court cannot personally appear in criminal matters before another District Court within the same judicial district. OAG 81-177.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a city has either established a position of legal advisor as a form of city employment or created the office of city attorney, no one could hold at the same time the state office of trial commissioner and the office of city attorney or city employment without violating Const., § 165 and KRS 61.080. However, if an attorney is employed on a personal service contract basis, he would be considered an independent contractor and there would be no constitutional or statutory objection to his serving as trial commissioner of the District Court.

    Where jurisdiction initially attached in the Circuit Court, it was not lost when that court, during the course of the trial, dismissed one felony count of a three-count indictment; jurisdiction having attached by reason of the felony charge was not divested by its final determination. Broughton v. Commonwealth, 596 S.W.2d 22, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 520 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    District Court ruling that there was no probable cause for search of defendant charged with drug possession and that evidence seized in the search should be suppressed was not binding on Circuit Court in subsequent trial since District Courts have no jurisdiction for final disposition of felony cases under this section. Waugh v. Commonwealth, 605 S.W.2d 43, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 366 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with burglary in the first degree and persistent felony offender in the first degree, the issuance of the indictment on the felony charge terminated the jurisdiction in the District Court and placed the sole jurisdiction in the Circuit Court; therefore, the District Court had no jurisdiction to accept the defendant’s plea to a reduced charge and there was no double jeopardy when the defendant was subsequently arraigned in the Circuit Court. Commonwealth v. Hamblem, 628 S.W.2d 345, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 315 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section unequivocally places jurisdiction in the Circuit Court when an indictment charges both a felony and a misdemeanor. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    District Court has no power to dispose of any charges which constitute lesser included offenses of the felony charged in the indictment. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Action of the District Court in accepting a plea of guilty to a possession charge after the return of the grand jury’s indictment for trafficking did not preclude a Circuit Court conviction on the same possession charge, as once the indictment was returned charging the offense of trafficking, the District Court no longer had jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the offense of possession, a lesser included offense. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Until such time as an indictment is reported to the Circuit Judge in a felony case, the District Court may exercise its jurisdiction and enter any order or judgment it deems appropriate; the reporting of an indictment to the Circuit Judge is essential to the validity of that action. Commonwealth v. Karnes, 657 S.W.2d 583, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 263 (Ky. 1983).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As a District Court lacked jurisdiction to make a final adjudication as to defendant’s felony charges, its dismissal of those charges did not preclude the Commonwealth, on double jeopardy grounds, from proceeding against defendant in Circuit Court on the same charges. Commonwealth v. Stephenson, 82 S.W.3d 876, 2002 Ky. LEXIS 165 (Ky. 2002).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    County attorney and the district court did not have the authority to approve a deferred prosecution on a charge of first-degree possession of a controlled substance under KRS 218A.14151 because only the Commonwealth’s attorney and the circuit court had jurisdiction over a felony offense. Commonwealth v. Vibbert, 397 S.W.3d 910, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 60 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).

    After an indictment has been returned incorporating misdemeanor offenses with related felony offenses, the misdemeanor offenses may be tried in the Circuit Court along with the felony offenses. Keller v. Commonwealth, 594 S.W.2d 589, 1980 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 1980).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A District Court has jurisdiction to hold a preliminary hearing on a misdemeanor charge and to refer that misdemeanor to the grand jury if it is joined with a felony. When the District Court conducts such a preliminary hearing, jeopardy will not attach on the misdemeanor to the extent that it has been joined with a felony. Commonwealth v. Arnette, 701 S.W.2d 407, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 296 (Ky. 1985).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Special Circuit Judge could not enforce his judgment accepting defendant’s plea of guilty of charge of driving under the influence (DUI) since such charge had not been consolidated with felony charge of possession of cocaine and, since District Court and not Circuit Court had jurisdiction. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 806 S.W.2d 643, 1991 Ky. LEXIS 34 (Ky. 1991).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A Circuit Court, vested with jurisdiction by a grand jury indictment, does not lose jurisdiction when a felony indictment is amended to a misdemeanor. Commonwealth v. Adkins, 29 S.W.3d 793, 2000 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 2000).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a Governor’s blanket pardon for individuals involved in a merit system investigation was valid under Ky. Const. § 77 and there was no evidence that defendant rejected the pardon, the order dismissing the indictment was vacated because the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction and the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the misdemeanor charges under KRS 24A.110. Commonwealth v. Groves, 209 S.W.3d 492, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 345 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    District court properly granted summary judgment to the police officer on the arrestee’s claim for false arrest because officer acted pursuant to legal process, and although it was later determined that arrest warrant lacked probable cause, district court had authority to issue the warrant based on a charge of terroristic threatening.

    The Circuit Court judge did not commit reversible error in remanding a misdemeanor charge to the District Court after a felony count that was coupled with the misdemeanor was dismissed by the Circuit Court. Kimbro v. Lassiter, 648 S.W.2d 860, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1983).

    Where a misdemeanor offense and a felony offense are joined in a single indictment, after the Commonwealth dismisses the felony charge then the trial court should immediately remand the misdemeanor to the District Court. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 806 S.W.2d 643, 1991 Ky. LEXIS 34 (Ky. 1991).

    Since District Court had concurrent jurisdiction with Circuit Court over charges of second-degree robbery, receiving stolen property and first-degree persistent felony offender, the District Court had authority to reduce such charges to a misdemeanor and enter judgment thereon prior to the return of indictment in Circuit Court and, subsequently, Circuit Court acted properly in dismissing the case on grounds of double jeopardy.

    Pursuant to KRS 24A.110(2), the district court, rather than the circuit court, enjoyed exclusive jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the defendant’s charge of failing to register a change of address as a sex offender, because the charge against the defendant could only be brought under the 1998 version of 17.510, for which the offense was a Class A Misdemeanor, rather than the 2000 version of the statute, for which the offense was a Class D Felony. Peterson v. Shake, 120 S.W.3d 707, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 201 (Ky. 2003).

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    A grand jury may return a misdemeanor indictment, however it would be impractical to affirmatively seek a misdemeanor indictment, where it is not required, and is not a usual method of procedure. OAG 78-168.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The District Court has jurisdiction to dispose of any nonfelony criminal offense and the charge may be brought by information or complaint. OAG 78-168.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The enforcement of city ordinances is generally within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court and all fees, fines, forfeitures and costs in any District Court case shall be collected and accounted for by the circuit court clerk and paid into the state treasury; however, the city does not receive fines imposed by the District Court and collected by the Circuit Court Clerk although the city, pursuant to former KRS 24A.190 through 24A.192, may have funds returned to it if it qualifies under those statutes. OAG 78-682.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The only reading of KRS 318.190, 23A.010 and this section which gives effect to all three statutes is that the misdemeanor penalty established by KRS 318.990 must be prosecuted in District Court. OAG 78-742.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a defendant, who is charged with a felony, is placed on trial before a Circuit Judge and jury, and the felony charge is amended to a lesser included misdemeanor charge by the Circuit Judge, the Circuit Court must proceed with trial of the misdemeanor to judgment. OAG 79-570.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The authority for a District Court to order transfer of District Court prisoners to an out-of-the-county jail is an inherent power under its general criminal jurisdiction. OAG 79-588.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county attorney is required to prosecute violations of municipal ordinances in the District Court. OAG 80-34.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The District Court’s criminal jurisdiction under this section inherently gives him the authority to see to it that prisoners under his jurisdiction and requiring incarceration are placed in a suitable county jail. OAG 80-129.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 61.170 requires an indictment by a Circuit Court grand jury in order to charge the offense of malfeasance or neglect of county officers; but since this section vests exclusive jurisdiction of misdemeanor cases, generally, in the District Court, the Circuit Court in which such an indictment is returned has necessarily, because of the jurisdictional statute, the authority and duty to refer the indictment for trial or other appropriate disposition to the District Court of that county. OAG 80-152.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Even if subsection (4) of this section is interpreted literally, it is impossible for a District Court to amend a third or subsequent offense under KRS Chapter 242 and treat it as a first or second offense, since the convictions of the first and second offense are already of record and nothing can change that fact. OAG 80-335.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since the record of two or more prior convictions under KRS Chapter 242 indicates that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to try the defendant a third time, the defendant could, under RCr 10.22 (abolished), file a motion in arrest of judgment on the ground of no jurisdiction, provided that the motion is filed within five days after determination of guilt; in view of RCr 13.04, a defendant in such case could file a motion to set aside the judgment under the terms outlined in CR 60.02. OAG 80-335.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where court records show two convictions under KRS Chapter 242, the third offense under that chapter would be a felony, and the District Court would not have jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea or try the case since this section expressly provides that the District Court has no jurisdiction of felony cases. OAG 80-335.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The judge has the primary duty to determine where the defendant is to be committed and to enter an order directing such commitment; however, the court may order the sheriff to keep it informed of what facilities are available for housing the prisoners, and where the judges have ordered the sheriff to keep them informed of what facilities are available to house prisoners, he must do so. OAG 80-482.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a peace officer issues a citation pursuant to KRS 431.015 charging a person with the violation of a city ordinance, and the person fails to appear in response to the citation, the District Court cannot acquire jurisdiction under subsection (2) of this section and cannot impose a fine against the person until the person is properly before the court, either by way of a voluntary personal appearance or pursuant to a warrant or summons. OAG 81-252.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Felony cases do not have to go through District Court before they are presented to the grand jury and once a person is indicted on a felony charge by a grand jury, the case cannot be sent back to the District Court since the District Court no longer has jurisdiction in the case. OAG 83-31.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court to examine a charge of first-degree wanton endangerment, a felony. OAG 83-31.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. This section, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence. OAG 91-67.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Unless a District Court, upon a showing of good cause, amends a felony charge to a misdemeanor or finds a lack of probable cause and releases the defendant from custody, its sole authority with respect to a felony charge is the authority to examine the charge and determine whether to commit the defendant to jail or hold him to bail or other form of pre-trial release. OAG 91-67.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a District Court has found, as a result of a preliminary hearing proceeding, that probable cause exists to believe that a felony has been committed, but a grand jury has not yet returned an indictment, the District Court does not have the authority to order that personal property seized incident to the arrest or by execution of a search warrant be returned to the defendant. OAG 91-67.

    Since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters, any papers relative to an uncontested estate in which no final settlement was filed prior to January 2, 1978, should be transferred to the clerk of the District Court of that county and duplicates should be filed with the county clerk. OAG 78-68.

    The District Judge has the authority to take the executor’s bond book or administrator’s bond book from the county clerk’s office and surrender it to the circuit clerk since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters (wills and settlement of estates).

    Since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters, and since a contest of probate matters can only be filed in the Circuit Court, if at the time a will and related papers are offered and tendered with the District Court no adversary proceeding in such estate has been instituted in the Circuit Court, the District Court may proceed to exercise its jurisdiction; thus a party cannot come into the District Court objecting to the probate of the will or threatening to file litigation in Circuit Court, since such adversary party will have to file a suit in Circuit Court contesting such proposed will. OAG 79-81.

   <p class="p7">
    A clerk is not responsible in any way to any person who may be misled if a certified copy of an order of appointment is given to an administrator named in the copy who uses it to show his appointment, when actually the estate has been settled: the clerk has no duty to inform the public of the active or inactive status of each estate.

    The District Court has jurisdiction in actions under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act where there is an attempt to enforce support arrearage in excess of $1,500, notwithstanding the provisions of this section because, while this section generally governs the District Court’s jurisdiction, in the specific matter of uniform support actions, KRS 407.100(4) (repealed) and 407.170 (repealed) are controlling so that, regardless of the amount of support money sued for, the District and Circuit Courts have concurrent jurisdiction of such actions. OAG 80-159; OAG 80-615.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. KRS 24A.110, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence. OAG 91-67.

    As between legislation of a broad and general nature on one hand and legislation dealing minutely with a specific matter on the other hand, the specific will prevail over the general, and, accordingly, the specific prohibition of KRS 189.990 against imposing of costs in parking violations prevails over the generality of this section, which purports to require payment of costs in all criminal prosecutions upon conviction. OAG 78-328.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where two statutes enacted at the same session are destructively repugnant, the law last enacted must be regarded as the final expression of the legislative will and permitted to prevail; since amended KRS 189.990(1) and this section are destructively repugnant, KRS 189.990, as the last enacted, prevails. OAG 78-328.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A reasonable construction of former subsection (5) of this section means that the jail money paid by the circuit clerk to the county treasurer should be considered for expenditure, during the fiscal year received, through the budget item or items established for county jail operations, since Const., § 157 and KRS Chapter 68 contemplate a pay-as-you-go budget and no fiscal court can deliberately budget surpluses. OAG 80-448.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It is the responsibility of the fiscal court to see that any county jail money, arising out of this section, which is actually surplus at the end of a particular fiscal year is either placed in a reserve fund for construction, or budgeted for expenditure for noncapital jail purposes for subsequent fiscal years, depending upon the necessary operational expenses of the county jail; in any event, this section requires that the so-called jail money be spent for the sole purpose of defraying the costs of operation of the county jail. OAG 80-448.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The money coming into the county treasury pursuant to former subsection (5) of this section may be budgeted or earmarked by way of a special reserve fund for construction purposes, which may be maintained and carried over for the number of fiscal years necessary, provided that the fiscal court has by order or resolution committed the county to a definite capital project, supported by a bond issue or holding corporation action on the part of fiscal court. OAG 80-448.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The phrase “costs of operation of the county jail” in former subsection (5) of this section is very broad; under ordinary usage of language the phrase is broad enough to embrace the use of the money for new construction of a jail or construction of a new addition. OAG 80-448.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Former subsection (5) of this section was enacted to allay a shortage of funding for the operation of jails and housing of prisoners and the funds allotted hereunder were intended to be used to defray all costs associated with performing the duty of operating a jail. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The funds allotted pursuant to former subsection (5) of this section may be used for capital expenditures in connection with constructing a new jail or renovating an old one. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The money allotted under former subsection (5) of this section may be used for juvenile detention costs such as the payment of per diem fees to families who keep juveniles or to the county juvenile detention center for keeping out of county juveniles insofar as these juveniles could be housed and kept in the county jail if there was one. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The money allotted under former subsection (5) of this section may be used to pay the charges made to a county which had no jail by other counties that house and keep its prisoners in their jails. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where prisoners that would have been housed in a county jail, if it had one, were instead housed in a city jail, the city could charge the county on a cost-sharing percentage or per diem basis for housing the county prisoners, just as one county may charge another for performing like services and the county jail fund could be used to pay this charge. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where there is a jail, the funds collected under former subsection (5) of this section may be used to defray the costs of running the physical facility and of keeping and housing prisoners therein and, where the county does not have a jail, the funds may be used to cover the costs of providing alternative methods of housing and keeping prisoners. OAG 80-535.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Payment of a salary to a jailer during the closing of the jail for capital improvements is legal where the jailer is putting in at least a normal five-day work week supervising the capital improvements on the jail and preparing himself to run the jail once it reopens. OAG 80-661.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a new jailer supervised capital improvements on jail and, while the jail was closed for such improvements, also took applications and interviewed prospective deputies and worked on a daily basis with state officials and prepared a procedures manual which the county judge/executive had requested that he prepare, such activities related exclusively to the county jail operation and the phrase “operation of the county jail” in former subsection (5) of this section is broad enough to cover the period during which the jail was being repaired and the new jailer was preparing himself to adequately perform as jailer once the jail reopened; moreover, the repair of the jail is vital to its effective use as a place of detention and thus the repair period must logically fall within the ambit of jail operations, therefore, the regular jailer’s salary may be paid to the new jailer during said period out of the cost money described in former subsection (5) of this section. OAG 80-661.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The money going to the counties from this section is for the sole purpose of defraying the costs of operation of the county jail. Such money may be spent to fund or partially fund the salary of a jail matron, which is properly a part of the costs of operating a county jail, subject to proper budgeting procedure under KRS Ch. 68. OAG 82-137.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although the two 1982 amendments to this section are generally similar in that they involve court cost increases, there is no express nor implied basis for repeal of one by the other; thus effect must be given to both. OAG 82-208.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The 1982 amendment by ch. 235 provides for the $5.00 increase of costs listed under subdivisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section in order to help in the funding of county jails while Acts 1982, ch. 266, which increases the same fees by $7.00, is an “Act relating to fees and costs for utilizing state services” (performed by state employees or officers); the two amendments, in increasing such court costs, had two different purposes in mind and for that reason they cannot be considered in duplication of each other. OAG 82-208.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There are no apparent conflicts between the two 1982 amendments to this section, and thus the $5.00 increase of ch. 235 and the $7.00 increase of ch. 266 must be added together for a total of $12.00 increase of the court costs dealt with in subdivisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section. OAG 82-208.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since former subsections (5) and (6) of this section had two different purposes in mind, one being jail operational costs, the other being construction costs, they are not in duplication of each other. OAG 82-314.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The principle that the specific shall prevail over the general means that former subsection (6) of this section must be recognized as being exclusive of former subsection (5) of this section, since it deals with the specific expense of construction costs. OAG 82-488.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The mandate of former subsection (5) of this section was such that the fiscal court was restricted to using that money only for county jail operational costs. None of those funds can be reserved for some other purpose, such as jail construction costs. OAG 82-488.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Former subsection (6) money was to be used only for jail construction, while former subsection (5) money was to be used by the fiscal court for jail operational costs that do not include construction costs. When those subsections are read in pari materia, the emerging intent is that operational costs may cover any jail expense except construction costs; in that manner, the two subsections are a part of a connected system. OAG 82-488.

   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    The purpose of KRS 24A.200 to 24A.360 is to improve the administration of justice in small noncriminal cases, and make the judicial system more available and comprehensible to the public; to simplify practice and procedure in the commencement, handling, and trial of such cases in order that plaintiffs may bring actions in their own behalf, and defendants may participate actively in the proceedings rather than default; to provide an efficient and inexpensive forum with the objective of dispensing justice in a speedy manner; and generally to promote the confidence of the public in the overall judicial system by providing a forum for small claims.

    Seller involved in a small claims action against the buyer, who sued it when the generator that the buyer purchased from the seller soon caught fire, could not show that a presumption of the Kentucky Products Liability Act (Act), contained in KRS 411.310(2), applied. Since a small claims action was involved, that Act did not apply and, indeed, the simplified small claims procedure set forth in statutes such as KRS 24A.200 and KRS 24A.300(2) governed such actions.

    Where a county fiscal court ordered the county ambulance service, a service neither funded nor regulated by the court, but the majority of whose employees are paid through CETA, to not take individuals failing to pay their ambulance bills to small claims court, the fiscal court order is a nullity as an attempted usurpation of the power of the legislature to define jurisdiction of and access to the Small Claims Court.

    Seller involved in a small claims action against the buyer, who sued it when the generator that the buyer purchased from the seller soon caught fire, could not show that a presumption of the Kentucky Products Liability Act (Act), contained in KRS 411.310(2), applied.

    Because a court can only facially invalidate a statute for vagueness if the statute chills a substantial amount of protected speech, the court finds that the “reasonably be questioned” language of KRS 26A.015(2)(e) and SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) is not impermissibly vague. Family Trust Found., Inc. v. Wolnitzek, 345 F. Supp. 2d 672, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24458 (E.D. Ky. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Plaintiffs, who sought to have judicial candidates answer survey questions regarding their views on particular issues, were entitled to a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of SCR 4.300-5B(1)(c), which sought to regulate and prohibit statements of candidates for judicial office, because Canon 5B(1)(c) was overbroad in that it prohibited certain types of protected speech and plaintiffs were likely to prevail with respect to this claim. However, plaintiffs were not likely to prevail with respect to their challenge to the recusal statute, KRS 26A.015(2)(e), or SCR 4.300-3E(1) because they had not shown that they would suffer irreparable injury if the court denied the relief requested. Family Trust Found., Inc. v. Wolnitzek, 345 F. Supp. 2d 672, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24458 (E.D. Ky. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    While SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) and KRS 26A.015(2)(e) may have the effect of chilling some speech, the court could not conclude that in light of the state’s compelling interest in maintaining the impartiality and appearance of impartiality of the courts that SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) and KRS 26A.015(2)(e) prohibits a “substantial” amount of protected speech in relation to its many legitimate applications.

    There is no merit in the argument that a trial judge is not required to disqualify himself if his ruling involves a question of law rather than a matter of discretion, since this section does not condition a judge’s disqualification on the type of ruling involved.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 26A.020(1) provides a separate and distinct opportunity to a party who does not believe he or she will receive a fair and impartial trial. When a party or counsel seeks to disqualify or recuse a judge from proceeding further in any matter, a motion can be filed with the judge under this section or an affidavit pursuant to KRS 26A.020. It would also appear that an aggrieved party can do either or both. Nichols v. Commonwealth, 839 S.W.2d 263, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 143 (Ky. 1992).

    Where one of the attorneys was married to the sister of the trial court judge, the correct remedy would be under KRS 26A.020, rather than under subsection (2) of this section; therefore an action brought under this section must be dismissed. Middle States Coal Co. v. Cornett, 576 S.W.2d 250, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 658 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where defendant-petitioner, pursuant to CR 76.36, sought a writ of probation, seeking to disqualify the judge, under subsection (2)(d)2 of this section, since one of plaintiff’s cocounsel was the judge’s sister, it did not matter whether the degree of relationship was computed according to the common-law method, by which the degree is ascertained by counting down from common ancestor to the more remote party, or under the civil law method, which counts from one party to the common ancestor then down to the other, since in either event the sister was within the third degree of relationship, and accordingly the judge must disqualify himself. Middle States Coal Co. v. Cornett, 584 S.W.2d 593, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 681 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where an attorney married to the sister of the trial judge in the proceeding was intended to be one of the co-counsels but did not actually participate in the trial, he nevertheless acted “as a lawyer in the proceeding” under subsection (2)(d) of this section since it is immaterial whether that relationship continued into the trial itself; therefore, the trial judge’s refusal to disqualify himself constituted reversible error. Middle States Coal Co. v. Hicks, 608 S.W.2d 56, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 380 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).

    Where the spouse of the trial judge was an associate of the law firm that represented the patient in the medical malpractice action before the trial judge, the trial judge erroneously failed to recuse herself from the trial, as KRS 26A.015(2)(d)(2) and SCR 4.300, Canon 3E(1)(d)(ii) required the trial judge to recuse oneself if the judge’s spouse appeared before the trial judge, and SCR 1.10(a) imputed disqualification of one (1) associate of a law firm to all members of the firm.

    The language of subsection (2)(b) of this section is mandatory; therefore, the trial judge hearing the defendant’s motion for a new trial committed reversible error in not disqualifying himself, where the facts showed that the judge, while a county attorney, had served as an assistant to the Commonwealth’s attorney who prosecuted the defendant.

    Recusal is appropriate only when the information is derived from an extra-judicial source; knowledge obtained in the course of earlier participation in the same case does not require that a judge recuse himself.

    The trial judge did not err in failing to recuse himself because of information he learned while presiding over the subsequently withdrawn guilty plea. Marlowe v.

    Judge who issued a search warrant did not have to recuse from a suppression hearing involving the warrant because (1) nothing raised questions about the judge’s impartiality, (2) it was not alleged that the judge was not a neutral and detached magistrate able to make a probable cause finding, and (3) automatic recusal was not appropriate. Minks v. Commonwealth, 427 S.W.3d 802, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 166 (Ky. 2014).

    There was no error in the circuit court’s refusal to recuse pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26A.015(2)(a) where the trial judge’s ruling in the first action did not disqualify him, and even if it did, the circuit court was being called upon in the second action to review findings of fact and conclusions of law that had not been in existence during the earlier action, and thus, it had not expressed any type of opinion as to the findings of fact and conclusions of law before it in the second action.

    Under the major premise of SCR 4.300, Canon 3C, a judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned; as a general principle a judge should not sit in review of a case decided by him, however, this general principle must be given common sense application. Poorman v. Commonwealth, 782 S.W.2d 603, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1008, 110 S. Ct. 3249, 111 L. Ed. 2d 759, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3327 (U.S. 1990).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fact that appellate judge did not disqualify herself did not entitle appellant to reversal, where there was no issue on appeal directly or indirectly involving appellate judge’s rulings made at the District Court level, as the issues on appeal were confined to Circuit Court proceedings; the record did not suggest that the judge was aware before it was time for oral argument of her previous limited connection to this case; and where after it was brought to her attention during oral argument, there was no suggestion that appellant or his counsel preferred her recusal. Poorman v. Commonwealth, 782 S.W.2d 603, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1008, 110 S. Ct. 3249, 111 L. Ed. 2d 759, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3327 (U.S. 1990).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Some reasons for recusal are: (1) there is an issue on appeal that called for the trial judge to review a decision he had made at the District Court level; and (2) the trial judge was apprised of his connection with the matter sufficiently in advance of the time when the case is to be heard so that he could have been replaced without interrupting the procedure.

   <p class="p7">
    The expression of the concern by the trial judge that the victims of the crimes be informed of the prosecution’s recommendation under a plea agreement did not provide a basis for reversible error based on bias, prejudice or personal knowledge as contemplated by an automatic or statutory recusal in this section.

    Where judge’s impartiality might reasonably have been questioned in view of all the circumstances the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant’s motion for recusal. Sommers v. Commonwealth, 843 S.W.2d 879, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 137 (Ky. 1992).

   <p class="p7">
    Where during trial for trafficking in a controlled substance there were other charges pending against defendant stemming from the burglary of the home of the father of another judge, and judge in the drug case in stating his reasons for refusing to recuse himself said that he had no knowledge about the burglary and had not formed an opinion as to defendant’s guilt and no facts were presented to create an appearance of bias, the judge’s refusal to recuse himself was not error. Webb v. Commonwealth, 904 S.W.2d 226, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1995).

    It was appropriate for special judge to recuse himself, since he felt he would be unable to impose the death penalty under the circumstances of the case. Tamme v.

    Judge did not err by denying appellee’s motion to retroactively recuse herself because the only prior relationship between the judge and appellants’

The judge could not have been actually biased by facts that were not known to her. Petzold v. Kessler Homes, Inc., 303 S.W.3d 467, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 18 (Ky. 2010).

   <p class="p7">
    In a zoning dispute, there was no abuse of discretion in a trial judge’s refusal to recuse himself where there was no allegation of actual bias, and a close professional relationship between a city attorney and the judge was insufficient to require recusal under KRS 26A.015.

    There was no error committed by the trial court in denying the motion for judge to recuse himself where it was undisputed that the defendant did not raise any such issue on his appeals from the judgment and sentence entered after the first trial, nor did he file a motion pursuant to CR 59.05 to vacate the final judgment or to disqualify the trial judge. Also, the original motion to disqualify was not supported by an affidavit and finally, if defendant had filed a proper motion as required by this section, he could have required the matter to be transmitted to the Chief Justice for an immediate ruling, thereby avoiding what he later claimed was an unfair trial because of a presumptively biased judge.

    In order for a particular judge to appeal the issuance of a writ of prohibition against enforcing an order of the judge, the judge must make some showing that the court has been aggrieved; however, any judge in any division of a particular court may have decided any case or question in any other division of that court, and thus an order prohibiting an original judge from reinstating a sentence which was modified by a different judge was affirmed.

     (1)

    “Operating costs allowance” means compensation equivalent to the annual expenses borne by the unit of government for utilities, janitorial service, rent, insurance, and necessary maintenance, repair, and upkeep of the court facility which do not increase the permanent value or expected life of the court facility, but keeps it in efficient operating condition, and, at the election of the Administrative Office of the Courts, capital costs of interior or mechanical renovations for the benefit of the court.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    “Use allowance” means compensation equal to four percent (4%) annually of the total original capital costs and the cost of capitalized renovation of the court facility, except that if indebtedness has been incurred in respect to such capital costs at an interest rate equal to or greater than seven percent (7%), compensation shall be at a rate of eight percent (8%) annually of that portion of the capital costs for which the rate applies. For refinanced projects constructed or renovated prior to July 1, 1994, the use allowance payment shall not change for the term of the original bond issue, unless there is a change in the space occupied. For court facilities renovated or constructed after July 1, 1994, “use allowance” means the court’s proportional share of the annual principal and interest cost in connection with the renovation or construction, but not to exceed eight percent (8%) annually of capital costs, or, if there is no debt, four percent (4%) annually of capital costs. Beginning with court facility construction or renovation projects authorized by the 2000 Regular Session of the General Assembly, “use allowance” means the court’s proportional share of the annual principal and interest costs in connection with the construction or renovation of the facility, not to exceed the authorized annual use allowance.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    “Capital costs” means the costs borne by the unit of government, excluding grants, conditioned by the grantor agency specifically for court facility construction or renovation, for acquisition of property and for construction and capitalized renovation including interest accruing during construction or renovation, but no other interest of each court facility. If capital costs are not documented, reasonable estimates provided by qualified appraisers will suffice. After July 14, 2000, capital costs, for the purpose of computing the maximum annual use allowance, shall not exceed the project scope as authorized by the General Assembly in the judicial branch budget or as increased and approved under KRS 26A.164.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    “Capitalized renovation” means all remodeling involving the structural or mechanical systems, except for remodeling that involves substantial demolition of the original structure. Remodeling involving substantial demolition of the original structure shall constitute construction resulting in a new court facility.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    “Unit of government” means a county, city, urban-county government, special district, or corporate entity created for the purpose of constructing or holding title to a court facility.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)

    “Court facility” means the land and buildings owned or operated by a unit of government in which space for the court of justice is provided. Judges’ benches, jury and witness boxes, and fixed seating shall be considered as permanent building fixtures.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)

    “Court facilities standards committee” means a committee consisting of the Chief Justice or his designee; one (1) judge each of the Court of Appeals, the Circuit Court, and the District Court appointed by the Supreme Court; the president of the Circuit Clerks’ Association; the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the General Assembly; the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet; the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts; and a county judge/executive appointed by the Governor. Each appointed member shall serve for a term of four (4) years from the date of his appointment or until he vacates the office in respect to which he was appointed, whichever is earlier.

    This section does not mandate the placing of the Circuit and District Courts on the same floor or placing them in the same courtroom. OAG 77-177.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The legislature intended to weigh the sheer urgency of housing the new court system against the housing of necessary and vital county governmental operations in county courthouses and other county buildings and the housing of the new court system was to be given a high priority, subject to the principle that necessary county governmental operations would not be disrupted. OAG 78-116.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provision that the county shall provide such “reasonably available space” to the court system indicates that the initial determination of whether reasonably available space exists in a particular county is addressed, not to the judicial courts, but to the fiscal courts, and the fiscal court’s decision in this matter is final, except where the courts determine in an appropriate suit that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in determining that the space was not reasonably available for the courts. OAG 78-116.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a county cannot provide satisfactory office space for the Circuit Judge, and no public facilities are available as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, then under subsection (5) of this section, private facilities may be leased for the judge by the Finance Department. OAG 82-14.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a fiscal court is leasing courthouse space to the Circuit Judge, the fiscal court could not terminate this lease and use this office space for other county offices. OAG 82-14.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a Circuit Court is being held in a county courthouse, the fiscal court is, as a practical matter, required by subsection (2) of this section to also provide a Circuit Judge’s chambers or office in the courthouse. OAG 82-14.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Assuming that the Supreme Court of Kentucky has not ordered nor approved otherwise, the county government is mandated to furnish reasonably available space, as necessary, in the county courthouse, for the court system, as described in subsection (2) of this section, which would not disrupt the operation of county government. OAG 84-159.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It is clear from reading subsection (1) of this section that the county courthouse is the prime sought location of the local courts and the adjunctive operations, and the county, through the fiscal court, must provide such location, where the needed space is reasonably available and would not disrupt the operation of county government. OAG 84-159.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provision that the county shall provide such reasonably available space to the court system indicates that the initial determination of whether reasonably available space exists in a particular county is addressed to the fiscal court; its decision is final, except where the courts determine, in appropriate litigation, that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily. OAG 84-159.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Considering that the adequate housing of the court and the jail systems are to be given a high priority, under KRS 67.080, 67.083 and this section, the fiscal court of any county has the authority to allocate space in the county courthouse or its county buildings for the court and jail systems; its exercise of such authority can only be reversed by the courts, in a proper law suit, where the courts deem that the fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in its allocation decisions. OAG 84-263.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The first or immediate level of responsibility for furnishing space to the court system rests with the county government, and the initial determination of whether “reasonably available space” exists in a particular county facility is addressed to the appropriate fiscal court; therefore, unless the Kentucky Supreme Court has ordered otherwise, the county government is required to furnish reasonably available space in the county courthouse facilities. OAG 96-18.

    Court of Appeals of Kentucky interprets the phrase “not unduly burdensome to the rights of the defendant” from Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26A.140 to be analogous to the requirement of a finding of a compelling need found in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 421.350, as both provisions would require such finding under judicial precedent in order to comply with the Confrontation Clause. J.E. v. Commonwealth, 521 S.W.3d 210, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 99 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

    Court of Appeals of Kentucky rejects the contention that compliance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26A.140 necessarily requires implementation of the procedures set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 421.350. The legislature has had ample opportunity to amend § 26A.140 if it intended the phrase procedures shall be used to shield children from visual contact with alleged perpetrator to mean compliance with § 421.350, or to amend § 421.350 to reference § 26A.140. The Court of Appeals can only interpret the plain meaning of the words, which do not mandate taking of child witnesses' testimony via closed circuit television in either provision. J.E. v. Commonwealth, 521 S.W.3d 210, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 99 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

    KRS 26A.300 violates equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. §§ 1, 2, 3 in that KRS 26A.300’s penalty is assessed when a motion for discretionary review is denied by this Court and, when applicable, the assessment of the penalty is automatic and mandatory and applies only to unsuccessful appellants in second appeals from superseded money judgments. A penalty is not assessed against other unsuccessful appellants in second appeals, e.g., unsuccessful plaintiff-appellants, unsuccessful defendant-appellants who do not supersede a money judgment awarded against them, and unsuccessful appellants from non-money judgments and, therefore, the statute treats unsuccessful appellants in second appeals differently; furthermore, KRS 26A.300 is not rationally related to its goal of deterring frivolous appeals, especially where alternate, non-discriminatory deterrents in the court’s rules are more effective.

    KRS 26A.300 violates the separation of powers provisions of Ky. Const. §§ 27, 28 in that it deters all discretionary review motions, so it limits the court’s exclusive power under Ky.

    Where the supersedeas had been issued by the clerk of the Circuit Court, after the filing of the appeal in the Court of Appeals, and after the opinion of that court had been handed down, but, before the issuance of the mandate, and before the time of its issuance, the appellee was entitled to have damages awarded upon the amount of the judgment superseded, after its affirmance. (Decided under prior law)Kelly v. Kelly, 183 Ky. 172, 209 S.W. 335, 1919 Ky. LEXIS 486 (Ky.), modified, 183 Ky. 576, 209 S.W. 339, 1919 Ky. LEXIS 487 (Ky. 1919).

    What is denominated “damages” on a supersedeas bond is not strictly so, for it is at the same time a penalty or tax imposed by legislative enactment upon the unsuccessful litigant for having delayed the litigation, and for having kept the successful litigant from sooner collecting his debt — a panacea as it were, for the law’s delay. (Decided under prior law)Phillips v. Green, 288 Ky. 202, 155 S.W.2d 841, 1941 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1941); Solter v. Sandy Valley Grocery Co., 352 S.W.2d 816, 1961 Ky. LEXIS 214 (Ky. 1961).

    In order to impose the penalty provided in subsection (2) of this section, the judgment in question must be in a definite amount, certain and ascertainable, and the judgment must be collectible by execution without further order of the court; accordingly, where the trial court made no determination in a divorce judgment of the amount, if any, of the net proceeds of the crop sales, livestock sales and dividends payable to the wife as her portion of the marital property, the 10 percent penalty could not be applied.

    Purpose of KRS 26A.300 is not to punish a litigant for any wrong done; rather KRS 26A.300 imposes a penalty upon an unsuccessful litigant for having delayed litigation, and for having kept a successful plaintiff from sooner collecting his judgment.

    KRS 26A.300(3) contemplates that a litigant who seeks discretionary review while a judgment is superseded bears the risk of an unsuccessful outcome; a judgment creditor is entitled to enforcement of the judgment, and any period that judgment is superseded following a matter-of-right appeal delays enforcement of the judgment. Watts v. Lab. Corp., 139 S.W.3d 534, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 123 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).

    The appellee was entitled to recover ten percent damages upon that part of the judgment superseded, upon the dismissal of the appeal due to the appellant’s failure to timely file a transcript in the office of the clerk of the Court of Appeals, where the appeal granted from the Circuit Court was from the judgment as whole, even though the amount superseded was less than $500.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where wife in divorce proceeding was prevented by supersedeas from issuing an execution to recover any part of judgment to which trial court said she was entitled, trial court’s action in allowing supersedeas penalty on the amount it found had been affirmed was proper even though the specific amount the wife was entitled to recover was not specified in appellate opinion. (Decided under prior law)Sharp v. Sharp, 516 S.W.2d 875, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1974).

    This section is constitutional, representing an effective manner by which to insure representative jury panels from segments of the community, even though many otherwise eligible jurors are excluded because they do not register to vote. Ford v. Commonwealth, 665 S.W.2d 304, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 315 (Ky. 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 984, 105 S. Ct. 392, 83 L. Ed. 2d 325, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 4318 (U.S. 1984).

   <p class="p7">
    Where there was not one shred of evidence which indicated any irregularity or underrepresentation of certain groups in the jury panel, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant funds to secure the services of experts to attempt to prove such underrepresentation. McQueen v. Commonwealth, 669 S.W.2d 519, 1984 Ky. LEXIS 210 (Ky.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 893, 105 S. Ct. 269, 83 L. Ed. 2d 205, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 380 (U.S. 1984).

    Kentucky does not recognize young adults as an identifiable group, exclusion of which would be prohibited; thus, the fact that young adults were underrepresented on the jury panel did not deny the defendant his right to a jury representing a fair cross section of the community.

    To have been eligible for jury service, the name of persons selected by the jury commissioners must have been on the last returned assessor’s book. (Decided under prior law)Williams v. Commonwealth, 254 Ky. 277, 71 S.W.2d 626, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1934).

    Where commissioners in filling jury drum did not take names from tax list as prescribed, but placed names of persons whom they wished to favor thereon, motion to quash indictment and petit jury should have been sustained.

   <p class="p7">
    The failure of the jury commissioners to select jurors from last returned assessor’s book and to draw jurors’ names from the drum as directed by statute was not ground for vacating judgment after term, since assessment roll and jury list were public records so that failure could have been discovered before trial by exercise of reasonable diligence. (Decided under prior law)Richardson v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 291 Ky. 357, 164 S.W.2d 602, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1942).

    The latest revision of the rules of procedure appears to have resulted in jury selection rules which differ from the statute; however, to the extent there is a conflict, it must be resolved by following the rules rather than the statute, since the power to fix the method of jury selection is inherently one for the courts and not the legislature.

    The fact that a deputy sheriff who assisted in summoning the jurors for a criminal case was prejudiced against and hostile to the defendant would not constitute grounds for discharging the jury at the conclusion of the commonwealth’s evidence, where the fact was known to the defendant before the jury was sworn and he could have made objection at that time.

    The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a fair trial on the basis that the jury was not selected from a representative cross section of the community, where several prospective jurors were excused for medical, employment, or other hardship reasons, but the court did not excuse all those who expressed a desire to be excused. Stanford v. Commonwealth, 734 S.W.2d 781, 1987 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 1987), aff'd, 492 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 2969, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 3195 (U.S. 1989).

    The trial court did not violate the defendant’s right to a jury comprised of a fair cross section of the community by interviewing veniremen on the second day in alphabetical order, where the defendant did not identify any “distinctive” characteristic possessed by those whose surnames begin with the letters I-Z, and moreover, had the defendant proven or articulated such characteristics, there was no error as more than half of the jurors who actually heard the case had surnames beginning with these letters.

    The provisions and requirements of law providing for selection of jury panel were not merely directory but were of mandatory force in prescribing the one legal manner to be followed by the jury commission in its selection of grand and petit jurors, and must have been substantially complied with, even though noncompliance may have been waived by a party through failure to make proper objections at the proper time.

    In the selection of a jury there must be substantial compliance with the procedural steps outlined in the statute, and the right and power to disregard any one of these statutory provisions does not lie within the privilege of the judge of the court.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It is in the interest of justice that the statutes and rules for jury selection be closely followed, and that no substantial deviation be allowed, regardless of prejudice; the matter of jury selection is too important a part of the judicial system to permit variations, from one court to another, in compliance with controlling statutes. Allen v. Commonwealth, 596 S.W.2d 21, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 519 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    No substantial deviation from the method of jury selection provided by the rules and statutes is permitted, and where such a deviation has occurred, regardless of a showing of prejudice, if the error is properly preserved, a reversal is required. Bartley v. Loyall, 648 S.W.2d 873, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 289 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the procedure employed by the trial court in summoning prospective jurors complied with the relevant law, and the trial court’s failure to have those jurors who failed to respond to the summons personally served by the sheriff was not a substantial deviation from proper administrative procedure, no reversible error was found. Moreover, defendant failed to show that she was prejudiced by the procedure followed, a sufficient number of jurors existed, and the randomness of the jury pool was unaffected. Monroe v. Commonwealth, 244 S.W.3d 69, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 10 (Ky. 2008).

   <p class="p7">
    Circuit Court did not err in applying KRS 29A.060(4) when serving summons to jurors because under KRS 29A.060(4), the Circuit Court is left with the discretion to utilize the personal summons as it deems necessary; because the statute grants broader discretion to the Circuit Court than AP Part II, § 6, it does not hamper or unreasonably interfere with the administration of justice.

    Failure to comply substantially with requirements of statutes relating to formation of grand jury would not constitute grounds for setting aside indictments found by grand jury, in the absence of proof that rights of accused were actually prejudiced thereby, unless the failure was such as to indicate on its face the potentialities of danger to the rights of the accused.

    Any challenge to the qualification of a juror must be made before the jury is empaneled since to permit challenges after the verdict is rendered invites a situation in which attorneys may suspect a problem but wait until a case is lost before objecting; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying a motion for new trial which defendant insurance company made on grounds that one of the jurors was a convicted felon who had not been pardoned.

    Defendant charged with intentional murder waived any juror selection issue under RCr P. 9.34 by not timely objecting.

    Although the juror qualification forms contained a question whether they had served within the last 12 months, to which one juror admitted, and the other falsely denied their prior service, the plaintiffs were not entitled to a new trial due to the disqualification of the two jurors under subsection (2) of this section, because the plaintiffs failed to show in what way they were prejudiced, in that ten jurors found for the defendant, and the verdict would have apparently been the same. Pinkston v. Griffith, 730 S.W.2d 948, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 498 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Generally, any challenge to a juror’s qualification must be made before the jury is empaneled; however, where upon voir dire examination, the jurors remain silent when inquired whether any member has previously served, and it is discovered after trial that a juror should have been disqualified, a new trial is warranted, provided that the movant exercised reasonable diligence upon voir dire to discover the claimed disqualification. Pinkston v. Griffith, 730 S.W.2d 948, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 498 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).

   <p class="p7">
    Because the order improperly delegating the chief judge’s authority to disqualify, postpone and excuse jurors, had expired, but apparently was still being followed at time of defendant’s trial where he was convicted of second-degree burglary, there was no published order in effect at the time the jury was impanelled and neither defendant or his counsel could have known of the grounds for the challenge until after the jury was impanelled; therefore defendant did not waive his right to challenge the composition of the jury panel and the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a new trial based on an improperly selected petit jury.

    Decisions concerning disqualifications of, requests for postponement of, and excuse from jury service must be made by the Chief Circuit Judge or another judge. The delegation of this authority to administrative personnel constituted a substantial deviation from the law and rules and the chief judge’s subsequent concurrence with the decisions of the jury pool administrators did not cure the defect. Commonwealth v. Nelson, 841 S.W.2d 628, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 172 (Ky. 1992).

   <p class="p7">
    Circuit Court committed reversible error in overruling defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment against him where the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court improperly delegated to her administrative personnel the authority to excuse prospective jurors. The improper delegation tainted the selection process and thus rendered void the proceeding against defendant. Harris v. Commonwealth, 878 S.W.2d 801, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the authority to determine which jurors should be disqualified, postponed or excused cannot be delegated to administrative personnel, where county court administrator was able to excuse or transfer jurors based on their responses to a questionnaire and such error was properly preserved, such error necessitated granting defendant’s motion to dismiss and reversing defendant’s conviction for first degree criminal abuse.

    Trial court properly found that the juror was disqualified from serving on a criminal jury under the pre-2002 version of KRS 29A.080 as a convicted felon, despite the fact that the Governor had restored the juror’s right to vote and to hold public office; the Governor expressly restored the juror’s rights under Ky. Const., §§ 145, 150, both of which dealt with restoration of the right to vote and to hold office, and the Governor had the power under Ky.

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    In order to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion, it must be proven, by evidence and not just an affidavit, that distinctive groups, comprising a substantial percentage of the county population, have been excluded from jury service; ordinarily, professions or occupations are not distinctive groups in a community, absent a showing of numerosity and lack of community needs to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion. Commonwealth v. McFerron, 680 S.W.2d 924, 1984 Ky. LEXIS 274 (Ky. 1984).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In a murder case, when the trial court excused mothers with sole childcare responsibilities and workers whose employers would not pay them for missed days, but did not excuse white-collar workers with busy jobs, this was not an impermissible systematic exclusion of a class of jurors.

    Decisions concerning disqualifications of, requests for postponement of, and excuse from jury service must be made by the Chief Circuit Judge or another judge. The delegation of this authority to administrative personnel constituted a substantial deviation from the law and rules and the Chief judge’s subsequent concurrence with the decisions of the jury pool administrators did not cure the defect.

    Circuit Court committed reversible error in overruling defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment against him where the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court improperly delegated to her administrative personnel the authority to excuse prospective jurors. The improper delegation tainted the selection process and thus rendered void the proceeding against defendant. Harris v. Commonwealth, 878 S.W.2d 801, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

   <p class="p7">
    Because the authority to determine which jurors should be disqualified, postponed or excused cannot be delegated to administrative personnel, where county court administrator was able to excuse or transfer jurors based on their responses to a questionnaire and such error was properly preserved, such error necessitated granting defendant’s motion to dismiss and reversing defendant’s conviction for first degree criminal abuse.

    (8/24/2005). In 2002 Ky. Acts ch. 252, sec. 7, the following text was erroneously included in this statute: “At any time for cause shown, the court may excuse a grand juror either temporarily or permanently and may swear another grand juror from a current jury panel in place of the one excused.
    The discharge of any such grand juror shall in no way or manner affect any indictment found by the grand jury as it was composed either before or after such discharge. If it is impossible to fill the vacancy on the grand jury from a current jury panel, the Chief Circuit Judge may summon, using the procedure in KRS 29A.060(5), such number of prospective jurors as deemed necessary for the purpose.”

    This text was not part of the statute when the section was created in 1976, and it was never added to the statute in accordance with the requirements of KRS 446.145(1).

    Grand jury is a part of the court, and under judicial control, so there can be no doubt that a session of the grand jury is a proceeding in a Circuit Court, however, this does not mean that the court “controls” a grand jury’s proceedings; the grand jury’s functional independence from the judicial branch is evident in both the scope of its power to investigate criminal wrongdoing and in the manner in which that power is exercised. Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 2004), limited, Gilbert v. McDonald-Burkman, 320 S.W.3d 79, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 193 (Ky. 2010).

    The trial judge erred by refusing to allow defendant to be sentenced by a jury on resentencing for a wanton murder conviction since a criminal defendant has a statutory right to have his sentence set by a jury and the trial judge is not vested with the authority to abrogate a criminal defendant’s right to jury sentencing by speculating on what sentence the jury would have imposed if properly instructed.

    In a misdemeanor case in District Court the defendant may waive his right to be tried by a jury, and he may instead be tried by the judge of the court without the intervention of a jury, provided that (1) the defendant affirmatively in open court waives such right and enters into the waiver understandingly and voluntarily and (2) the Commonwealth agrees and the trial court approves; thus, the waiver would require both the consent of the prosecutor and the judge and, in addition, where the prosecutor objects to the waiver, and thus in effect demands a trial by jury, he is not required to advance any specific reason for his demanding a trial by jury.

    The “civil actions” referred to in Ky.

    Unanimity is violated where jury is instructed that it can find defendant guilty under either of two theories, if the evidence only supports a conviction under one of the two theories. Davis v.

    Trial court acted properly in allowing the Commonwealth to waive one of its peremptory challenges to allow a full six (6) member jury where defendant received the required number of peremptory strikes, three (3), and exercised them accordingly. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 148 S.W.3d 817, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 308 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Twelve-person jury is a fundamental right in the Commonwealth, and any waiver of that right must be knowingly and voluntarily made by the defendant personally, not by his counsel unilaterally as a trial-management decision. While waiver of a twelve-person jury should be established through the trial court’s colloquy with the defendant on the record, failure to do so may be harmless error; where counsel has stipulated to proceeding with less than twelve jurors and the defendant has seemingly acquiesced, on remand the trial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if the defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to that decision. Commonwealth v. Simmons, 394 S.W.3d 903, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 32 (Ky. 2013).

   <p class="p7">
    Jury instruction for use of a minor under the age of 18 in a sexual performance as to defendant’s niece denied him a unanimous verdict under KRS 29A.280(3) because it failed to differentiate factually between the alleged instances of sexual abuse; the instruction allowed the jury to convict him of one crime based on two separate and distinct criminal acts that violated the same statute.

    Where defendant was convicted of second-degree assault and tampering with physical evidence, the trial court did not commit plain error in permitting each party nine peremptory challenges.

    A per se disqualification is not required merely because a juror does not instantly embrace every legal concept presented during voir dire examination. The test is not whether a juror agrees with the law when it is presented in the most extreme manner. The test is whether, after having heard all of the evidence, the prospective juror can conform his views to the requirements of the law and render a fair and impartial verdict. Mabe v.

    A potential juror may be disqualified from service because of connection to the case, parties or attorneys and that is a bias that will be implied as a matter of law; the trial court must determine the existence of bias based on the particular facts of each case. Randolph v. Commonwealth, 716 S.W.2d 253, 1986 Ky. LEXIS 291 (Ky. 1986). Overruled in part on other grounds as stated in Commonwealth v. Wolford, 4 S.W.3d 534, 1999 Ky. LEXIS 93 (Ky. 1999).

    Even where jurors disclaim any bias and state that they can give the defendant a fair trial, conditions may be such that their connection would probably subconsciously affect their decision in the case.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The failure of the juror to reveal on voir dire examination that she was employed as a secretary by the Commonwealth’s attorney was implied bias, as there were reasonable grounds to believe that she could not render a fair and impartial verdict, and it was entirely possible that she may have been in a position to have known about the prosecution prior to trial. Randolph v. Commonwealth, 716 S.W.2d 253, 1986 Ky. LEXIS 291 (Ky. 1986). Overruled in part on other grounds as stated in Commonwealth v. Wolford, 4 S.W.3d 534, 1999 Ky. LEXIS 93 (Ky. 1999).

    The right to a fair and impartial jury is fundamental and does not rest on the giving or not giving of the admonition to the jury not to form or express an opinion until the cause is finally submitted to them. (Decided under prior law)Butler v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Highways, 387 S.W.2d 867, 1965 Ky. LEXIS 490 (Ky. 1965).

   <p class="p7">
    Where one of the jurors, after the evidence was finished but before the case was submitted to the jury, discussed the insurance aspects of the case with the secretary of one of the attorneys in the case, the admonition to the jury was violated, thus requiring a new trial.

    Reliance must be placed upon the integrity of the jurors and where the jury was near other people in a temporary courtroom while they assisted the deputy sheriff in obtaining chairs for the jury room a motion for new trial will not be granted on the ground that there was a separation of the jury while under special guard. (Decided under prior law)Roark v. Commonwealth, 321 S.W.2d 783, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 288 (Ky. 1959).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The word “separation” applies to the entire jury and where they are permitted to go about their business until told to reconvene, therefore, conveyance in more than one automobile to the scene of an accident is not “separation” requiring admonition under the statute since the jury is still functioning as an entity. (Decided under prior law)Davidson v. Moore, 340 S.W.2d 227, 1960 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1960).

    Where sheriff who participated in the investigation of case talked with a juror after the trial had commenced, but the conversation was “innocent,” trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial. Jones v. Commonwealth, 662 S.W.2d 483, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 400 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A new trial was necessary to obviate the error where a juror, despite the numerous and specific admonitions to the contrary, discussed the merits of the appellant’s case with a third party. Doyle v. Marymount Hospital, Inc., 762 S.W.2d 813, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 131 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fact that sheriff had engaged in conversation with three jurors constituted a harmless violation of this section, where the conversations were “innocent” and matters pertaining to the case at hand were not discussed. Talbott v. Commonwealth, 968 S.W.2d 76, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 41 (Ky. 1998).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Juror’s brief conversation and contact with some of the prosecution’s witnesses during trial violated KRS 29A.310(2), but a mistrial was not warranted as there was no record of the brief conversation between the juror and the witnesses; thus, defendant could not meet his burden of showing that there was substantial injustice. Graham v. Commonwealth, 319 S.W.3d 331, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 183 (Ky. 2010).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A conversation held by an officer with a juror after the jury had been sworn, and without the permission of the court, upon a subject not connected with the trial, was not such an irregularity as to require the verdict to be set aside, when it did not appear that the rights of accused were prejudiced. (Decided under prior law)Canter v. Commonwealth, 176 Ky. 360, 195 S.W. 825, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 69 (Ky. 1917).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Counsel for one of the litigants on trial was not an “officer” but if he did come within the purview of the statute there was no penalty attached for violation of the statute nor any punishment for violation by anyone and conversation of counsel with jurors on subject wholly unrelated to the case was not ground for a new trial. (Decided under prior law)C. V. Hill & Co. v. Hadden's Grocery, 299 Ky. 419, 185 S.W.2d 681, 1945 Ky. LEXIS 438 (Ky. 1945).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In an action to set aside deeds it was not reversible error because the clerk of the court talked to a couple of the jurors during the trial in contravention of statute prohibiting conversation with jury when the conversation was as to where in the community a corn shredder was located and as to where they would eat lunch since appellant’s rights were not prejudiced by innocent conversation with a juror on a matter foreign to the trial. (Decided under prior law)Owings v. Webb's Ex'r, 304 Ky. 748, 202 S.W.2d 410, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 718 (Ky. 1947).

    Where there was a temporary withdrawal of a juror from the immediate presence of his fellow jurors, or the guard, unless it was shown that something improper occurred the court would not grant a new trial upon that ground.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Motion for a new trial was denied where after the case was submitted to the jury, a deputy sheriff entered the jury room with the jurors to open a window for ventilation and he swore he did not say anything to any one of the jurors about the case, nor did any of the jurors say anything to him relative to the case. (Decided under prior law)Roark v. Commonwealth, 321 S.W.2d 783, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 288 (Ky. 1959).

    Former section did not limit the right of the court to permit the jury to view objects other than real property or the place in which any material fact occurred, where such view is reasonably necessary for a proper understanding and appreciation of the facts in dispute, even though such objects are not located at the place of the accident.

    Trial judge did not abuse his discretion in overruling defendant’s request that jury view the crime scene, where defendant’s rationale for requesting the viewing was to show that lights at crime scene had been dimmer than eyewitnesses testified, a fact which could not be proven or disproven by a jury viewing. Sholler v. Commonwealth, 969 S.W.2d 706, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 98 (Ky. 1998).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In a prosecution for kidnapping and robbery, a jury view of the crime scenes had not been required under KRS 29A.310(3), as witnesses explained the events by use of photographs of the scenes and, by virtue of these visual aids, the jury was adequately apprised of the physical nature of the two (2) scenes.

    In action for damages by reason of an accident brought about by the unsafe and dangerous condition of a road, court properly exercised its discretion at the trial in refusing to order a view of the premises by the jury, where several months had elapsed since the accident, and the pile of gravel, alleged to have caused the injury, had been spread and condition of the road changed. (Decided under prior law)Henderson & Corydon Gravel-Road Co. v. Cosby, 103 Ky. 182, 44 S.W. 639, 19 Ky. L. Rptr. 1851, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 47 (Ky. 1898).

    In permitting jury to retire to the courthouse yard to see horse and phaeton in which injuries occurred, the court was not acting under terms of former section in that jury was not taken to see “real property” nor place where any “material fact occurred,” but court acted properly.

    In absence of affidavit in support of motion that the jury be allowed to view place where intestate was killed, the lower court was doubtlessly unable to see that there was anything in case that required a view by the jury of the place of accident, and no error was committed in overruling motion.

    In action for injuries from slipping on private driveway, it was not abuse of discretion to permit jury to view premises even though condition was not same as at time of accident since evidence had fully disclosed condition of premises at time of accident and jury must have taken change of condition into consideration in viewing premises.

    In action to recover for hand crushed in sandpapering machine, reversible error was committed in the jury having been permitted to view the machine and its location, and further permitted to have machine operated. It is the place and the place only that the court is authorized to send the jury to see.

    Fact that court permitted the jury to go to the place of the accident in three automobiles accompanied by an officer of the sheriff’s department in one of the cars was not “separation” and was not reversible error in absence of any showing that the jury was tampered with or that an outsider attempted to communicate with them.

    The trial court clearly was authorized to send the jury back for further deliberations after the initial jury poll revealed the fifth juror’s ambiguous opinion and the second poll of the entire jury revealed no lack of unanimity.

   <p class="p7">
    Circuit clerks are not at all subject to the supervision of prosecutors, but of the judiciary, and the fact that a warrant must be prepared by the Commonwealth’s or county attorney has nothing to do with the clerk’s exercise of independent judgment in deciding whether probable cause has been shown to justify issuance of warrant; furthermore the determination of probable cause is made not from the warrant but from the supporting affidavit or affidavits. Commonwealth v. Bertram, 596 S.W.2d 379, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 304 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).

    The District Court clerk should prepare the warrant or summons in actions for forcible entry or detainer. OAG 78-212.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a deputy Circuit Court clerk is a state officer and a county treasurer is a county officer, the same person cannot, at the same time, fill both offices as they are incompatible with each other. OAG 80-608.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since Property Valuation Administrators (PVAs) and their deputies and employees are specifically authorized to participate in the public employees deferred compensation system and both PVAs and Circuit Court clerks are state officers, they meet the definition of “employee” set out in KRS 18.510(1) (now KRS 18A.230), and so do their deputies and employees; therefore, they may all participate in the public employees deferred compensation plan. OAG 80-246.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The authority to determine job assignments and work shifts relating to deputy circuit clerks is under the immediate authority of the circuit clerk, subject to any applicable rules or requirements coming from the Supreme Court, or the chief justice as the executive head of the Court of Justice, or the administrative office of the courts with the approval of the Supreme Court. OAG 80-646.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The positions of deputy circuit clerk, a state officer under this section, trial commissioner of the county District Court, a state officer under KRS 24A.100, are compatible with one another since neither Ky. Const., § 165, nor KRS 61.080 prohibits a person from holding two state offices at the same time; however, they may be incompatible under the doctrine of practical or common law. OAG 81-124.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no constitutional problem with KRS 172.110(1), which makes the circuit clerk the ex officio law librarian, except that the county law librarian function must not interfere with the clerk’s court functions as envisioned in Const., § 114 and this section; the circuit clerk is entitled to receive a salary from the county treasury, as a properly budgeted item under KRS Ch. 68, for actually serving as the ex officio librarian of the county law library and the salary provisions of KRS 64.055 (now repealed) relate solely to the work of the clerk as Circuit and District Court clerk. OAG 82-177.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The circuit clerk is a state officer as provided by this section and so are his deputy clerks, whether employed part-time or full-time, as the deputy clerk is given the same powers and duties of the clerk under KRS 30A.050(2) and must take the oath of office and execute bonds pursuant to KRS 30A.020 and 30A.030, in spite of the fact that subsection (2) of KRS 30A.050 indicates that deputies, along with other employees, are employees of the state.

    The Office for Public Advocacy (now Department of Public Advocacy) is an agency of the executive branch of the state government, and insofar as its relationship to the Court of Justice is concerned, the position of the public advocate is no more and no less than that of any other lawyer practicing before it.

    Before a trial court could invoke its inherent judicial power and step outside the framework of this chapter to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant on its own where the Department of Public Advocacy had failed to act, it had to exhaust the provisions of this chapter; such an action by the trial court must be a last resort alternative.

    The courts, under their general judicial jurisdiction, in a case involving two or more defendants in the same case, may in the interest of justice appoint another attorney or attorneys to represent such multiple indigent defendants other than the defendant being represented by the public advocate; the public advocacy policies of KRS Chapter 31 cannot negate the authority of the trial judge in this particular.

    Although this section might of itself prevent a person from serving as a public defender (now public advocate) and city attorney, especially if the public defender is employed to represent all indigents rather than where various attorneys are assigned on a case-by-case basis to represent indigents, there might also be an ethical problem involved which should be resolved by the Kentucky State Bar Association. OAG 73-851.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Even after a fiscal court has established an office for public defender (now advocate), it may abolish that office and contract with a nonprofit organization to provide defender services. OAG 78-81.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    By reasonable implication the fiscal court has the authority by ordinance to establish such positions, that is clerks, investigators, stenographers, as are necessary to carry out responsibilities of the office for public advocacy; once a particular position is authorized and created by the fiscal court, then under this section the district public advocate can fill the appointment, except that the fiscal court apoints the assistant district public advocates. OAG 78-700.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If the fiscal court by ordinance has established the position of investigator for the staff of the district public advocate, then that position can be filled by the district public advocate without the consent of the fiscal court and the position cannot be filled by the nomination by a member of the fiscal court and the subsequent acceptance of the nomination by the fiscal court as a body.

    The procedure envisioned in this section would govern over the general procedure established in KRS 67.710(7). OAG 78-700.

   <p class="p7">
    The court assigning an attorney to represent a needy defendant will prescribe a reasonable fee under subsection (3) of this section, which shall be paid by the county; however, no county, under former KRS 31.240(3)(repealed, see now KRS 31.050(4)), shall be required to pay the maximum amounts provided in subsection (4) of this section, unless such amounts are approved by the Circuit Judge. Under this analysis, the mere agreement of the county to pay only just what the state contributes to the county, plus what the indigent pays, may not meet the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. OAG 84-280.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (3) of this section was not intended to stake out the state contribution as the maximum to be paid by the committed county. In addition, where the court has set the fee under subsection (3) of this section, the fiscal court must, by the terms of former KRS 31.190 (repealed, see now KRS 31.050), pay that fee out of county appropriations, even if it equals the maximum provided in subsection (4) of this section; however, the court’s prescribed fee should not exceed the legislative maximum set out in subsection (4) of this section.

   <p class="p7">
    Because the trial court improperly denied appointment of counsel based upon the mere fact that a property bond had been posted to secure defendant’s release following his indictment, the court failed to apply the factors to determine defendant’s indigency as provided in KRS 31.120, and the court did not determine whether defendant was in fact indigent, defendant’s conviction for possession was reversed. Tinsley v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 668, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 61 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the trial court did not hold a formal hearing, did not enter findings to support its decision to vacate defendant’s public defender appointment, and made no inquiries as to the amount of defendant’s income, nor did it consider any of the other factors listed in KRS 31.120(2), defendant was entitled to a new trial. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the issue was whether or not defendant was indigent, not the financial circumstances of his friends or family members, and the fact that defendant might have been able to retain private counsel for the civil action was not dispositive of whether he was entitled to a public defender at his criminal trial, defendant was entitled to a new trial where the trial court denied him a public defender. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Statute allowing for costs to be assessed after sentencing, KRS 23A.205, allowed for court costs to be waived for “poor persons,” as defined in KRS 453.190(2), but did not give defendant the blanket immunity from costs that defendant suggested was required by KRS 31.110. Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant. Maynes v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 922, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 20 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It was error to impose fines for defendant’s convictions for fourth-degree assault and possession of marijuana because (1) the trial court previously found defendant to be indigent, under KRS 31.100(3), and (2) KRS 534.040(4) barred the imposition of fines on a person found to be indigent. Wright v. Commonwealth, 391 S.W.3d 743, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 496 (Ky. 2012).

    If an accused states that he is a needy person unable financially to obtain counsel, counsel should be appointed even though the judge feels the individual can afford to retain counsel; but, if the accused receives legal assistance to which he is not entitled, recovery may be had under KRS 31.150.

    An inmate at Eastern Kentucky Correctional Complex could not compel the circuit court to provide him with free copies of his closed files; KRS 31.100 et seq. are statutes covering the district public advocate and local programs for providing counsel for indigents, and KRS 31.200(3) provides that expenses incurred in the representation of needy persons confined in a state correctional institution shall be borne by the state Department of Public Advocacy.

    Trial court properly denied defendant’s request for funds to retain an independent psychiatrist because defendant failed to demonstrate that such funds were reasonably necessary to the defense. Defendant’s motion for funds contained only conclusory assertions that employment of a forensic psychiatrist was an absolute necessity to determine the mental health defenses, including mental illness and the IQ of the defendant.

    Because the trial court improperly denied appointment of counsel based upon the mere fact that a property bond had been posted to secure defendant’s release following his indictment, the court failed to apply the factors to determine defendant’s indigency as provided in KRS 31.120, and the court did not determine whether defendant was in fact indigent, defendant’s conviction for possession was reversed. Tinsley v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 668, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 61 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a defendant raises the issue of indigency, a hearing must be held thereon for a determination in accordance with the requirements set forth in KRS ch. 31, and the court must enter findings at the conclusion thereof. If the findings support indigency, counsel shall be appointed. If the findings do not support indigency, and the defendant persists in not employing counsel, he shall be deemed to have waived counsel, whereupon he is entitled to the protections of Faretta; should the trial court fail in the foregoing, the trial is defective. Tinsley v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 668, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 61 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the trial court did not hold a formal hearing, did not enter findings to support its decision to vacate defendant’s public defender appointment, and made no inquiries as to the amount of defendant’s income, nor did it consider any of the other factors listed in KRS 31.120(2), defendant was entitled to a new trial. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because the issue was whether or not defendant was indigent, not the financial circumstances of his friends or family members, and the fact that defendant might have been able to retain private counsel for the civil action was not dispositive of whether he was entitled to a public defender at his criminal trial, defendant was entitled to a new trial where the trial court denied him a public defender. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

    Once the court determined that defendant was ineligible for public defender assistance as a result of his ownership of real property, pursuant to KRS 31.120(3)(a), the Department of Public Advocacy had no obligation to pay attorney’s fees. Department of Public Advocacy Commonwealth v. Patrick, 765 S.W.2d 36, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 17 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Circuit Court lacked both statutory authority and jurisdiction to order the Department of Public Advocacy to pay attorney’s fees when the court had ruled prior to the time of trial that defendant was no longer eligible for a public defender and when no subsequent order had reversed that eligibility determination. Department of Public Advocacy Commonwealth v. Patrick, 765 S.W.2d 36, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 17 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).

    The provisions of subsection (1) of this section, KRS 31.110(1), RCr 2.14, and former KRS 31.150 (now repealed) signal an unmistakable message that the intent of the legislature is to provide meaningful, rather than nominal protection of the rights of the indigent. Thus, the authority of the Public Defender to act in a case vests at the earliest point at which a person is entitled to counsel (i.e. custodial interrogation), but not until a claim, without further proof, is made of need for public assistance by the accused. West v. Commonwealth, 887 S.W.2d 338, 1994 Ky. LEXIS 102 (Ky. 1994).

    The imposition of a recoupment fee after a defendant is found not guilty is neither unreasonable nor unconstitutional; a recoupment fee is not a penalty and is only assessed after the representation is complete, and only where the defendant can afford to pay a percentage of the defense costs on reasonable terms.

    If an accused states that he is a needy person unable financially to obtain counsel, counsel should be appointed even though the judge feels the individual can afford to retain counsel; but, if the accused receives legal assistance to which he is not entitled, recovery may be had under KRS 31.150.

    Any prisoner data or paperwork that is necessary to get for the prisoners the attention and possibly medical care by a licensed physician is a responsibility of the jailer, or his staff, having proper custody of such prisoners; the same is true where the court, under this section, requires certain paperwork relating to indigency. KRS 71.040 explicitly requires the jailer to treat the prisoners humanely; that human treatment would include any necessary paperwork or assistance in paperwork in connection with their medical treatment and court determination of indigency.

    In determining what constitutes a reasonable and necessary indigent expense, at a minimum, a service or facility the use of which is provided for by statute should be considered by a trial court, as a matter of law, to be “reasonable and necessary.” McCracken County Fiscal Court v.

    Whether indigent defendants are represented by local public advocates (under a KRS 31.160 plan) or by state public advocates is irrelevant to a county’s liability to pay for those expenses which a trial court considers to be reasonable and necessary, unless a statute directs otherwise.

    The special fund created in KRS 31.185(4) can be used to pay out-of-county witness expenses for indigent post-conviction petitioners, provided that a court has found that: (1) the petitioner’s post-conviction petition raises an issue that cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing, and (2) the proposed out-of-county witness’s live testimony at the evidentiary hearing is necessary for a full presentation of the petitioner’s case. Hodge v. Coleman, 244 S.W.3d 102, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 14 (Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Travel expenses for indigent postconviction petitioners’
    witnesses who reside out-of-county are to be paid from the special fund established by KRS 31.185(4)-(5) and are to be governed by the same general rules, regulations, and limits that are applicable to out-of-county witnesses called on behalf of the Commonwealth, regardless of their financial status. Hodge v. Coleman, 244 S.W.3d 102, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 14 (Ky. 2008).

   <p class="p7">
    Because indigent postconviction petitioners are entitled to public funds under KRS 31.185 for the travel expenses of out-of-county witnesses in cases where a court has determined that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to resolve a postconviction motion and where the appearance of such witnesses is necessary, petitioner was entitled to a writ of mandamus to the trial court in order to determine if the testimony of the witnesses was necessary.

    Petitioner was not entitled to a writ of prohibition on the basis that a judge failed to comply with the court’s earlier mandate by ordering an evaluation by the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center (KCPC) without first making a finding that the use of the state facilities was not impractical. While the order did not specifically address the mandate, the judge’s finding that KCPC was capable of providing a competent mental retardation evaluation of petitioner was the functional equivalent of a finding that the use of KCPC was not impractical, and thus, a mental evaluation by the facility was not precluded by KRS 31.185(1). White v. Payne, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 192 (Ky. Aug. 26, 2010), sub. op., 332 S.W.3d 45, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 314 (Ky. 2010), modified, in part, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 100 (Ky. Mar. 24, 2011).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Writ of prohibition was denied where a death row inmate was seeking to prevent a judge from enforcing an order requiring a mental retardation evaluation by the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center (KCPC) because this was not precluded by KRS 31.185(3) where there was a functional finding that the use of KCPC was not impractical. Even assuming that the trial court was acting erroneously as alleged by the inmate, he did not demonstrate an irreparable injury that would have resulted from the KCPC mental retardation evaluation and which could not have been redressed by appeal from a final determination of the case on the merits; the inmate’s rights under U.S. Const. amend. V were minimally implicated because the inmate had already been convicted and safeguards could have been used, the inmate’s claim that he would have been permanently deprived of his right to a full and fair hearing was vague, speculative, and unpersuasive, and there was no real threat to confidential defense communications.

    Petitioner convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment was not entitled to post-conviction DNA testing under KRS 422.285, because § 422.285 only allowed a person convicted of and sentenced to death for a capital offense to request DNA testing and analysis of evidence. Thus, petitioner failed to present a known grievance which necessitated a hearing under KRS 31.185. Partin v. Commonwealth, 337 S.W.3d 639, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 249 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

   <p class="p7">
    When a postconviction petitioner sought public funds to hire experts, “reasonably necessary” and “impractical use” findings could be made ex parte because (1) reference to “with regard to using private facilities” in Ky. Rev. Stat.

Commonwealth v. Grise, 558 S.W.3d 923, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 433 (Ky. 2018).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Ex parte hearing applied in the postconviction context because it was nonsensical to allow a criminally accused person access to public funds, subject to the statutory “impractical” requirement but to not afford them a statutory ex parte hearing to make the request.

    Although a county’s commitment to a public advocate program is permissive, when a county does select a public advocate program under KRS 31.160, the county is committed for that particular fiscal year and must pay any necessary defense expenses other than the defense counsel fees covered in the state’s appropriation under KRS 31.050(2); where a county is currently under a public advocate program, the county must bear the expense of expert witnesses’ fees and psychological examinations used in the defense of indigents charged with felonies and represented by the public advocate.

    Statute allowing for costs to be assessed after sentencing, KRS 23A.205, allowed for court costs to be waived for “poor persons,” as defined in KRS 453.190(2), but did not give defendant the blanket immunity from costs that defendant suggested was required by KRS 31.110. Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant.

     (1)
    </span>
    It shall be the duty of the attorney representing a client at trial under any public advocacy plan to file a notice of appeal if his or her client requests an appeal.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    After the attorney has filed a notice of appeal as required by the Rules of Criminal Procedure, he or she shall forward to the Department of Public Advocacy a copy of the final judgment, the notice of appeal, a statement of any errors committed in the trial of the case which should be raised on appeal, and a designation of that part of the record that is essential to the appeal.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    Any public advocacy attorney who is representing a client on appeal who after a conscientious examination of said appeal believes the appeal to be wholly frivolous after careful examinations of the record may request the court to which the appeal has been taken for permission to withdraw from the case. The attorney must file with that request a brief which sets forth any arguments which might possibly be raised on appeal. A copy of the request for permission to withdraw and the brief must be served upon the client in sufficient time so that the client may raise any argument he or she chooses to raise.

    The nature of the language of the compensation limitation in former subsection (4) of this section and the fact that master commissioners traditionally have performed judicial-type functions only in actions which involved execution of a judicial sale indicate that the $7,200 limitation applies only to compensation derived from fees arising from actions in which the master commissioner executes a judicial sale, and a master commissioner’s compensation for performing judicial-type functions in actions other than one in which he executes a judicial sale may exceed $7,200 annually. OAG 78-751.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A person who is the master commissioner of the county Circuit Court can lawfully be appointed to serve as a member of the water commission, since the office of master commissioner is, under this section, merely a position filled by and under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, rather than a state, county or city office; thus, no incompatibility exists under KRS 61.080 and Ky. Const., § 165, between the two positions. OAG 81-313.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under CR 53.08 the maximum compensation payable to master commissioners is $24,000 per annum; the $7,200 annual limit imposed by former subsection (4) of this section applies only to compensation derived from fees arising from judicial sales executed by the commissioner. OAG 82-24.

    After 90 days from the close of the 1982 session, the 1982 amendment to KRS 31A.010 will have the effect of providing that the master commission shall be compensated by fees as provided by rule of the Supreme Court; the rules referred to are CR 53.07 through CR 53.09 and, thus, at that point all of the master commissioners in Kentucky will be subject to a compensation derived from fees and not exceeding $24,000 per year. OAG 82-206.

   <p class="p7">
    In enacting the 1982 amendment to this section, the legislature has eliminated the special restrictions on master commissioners’ compensation formerly found in subsection (4) of this section in favor of a general law applicable to all master commissioners within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

    The appointment of a receiver is a matter always within the sound discretion of the court. (Decided under prior law) Woodward v. Woodward, 31 S.W. 734, 17 Ky. L. Rptr. 464 (1895); Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Eakin, 100 Ky. 745, 39 S.W. 416 (Ky. 1897); Hurst v. Nicola Bros. Co., 65 S.W. 364, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 1406, 1901 Ky. LEXIS 414 (Ky. Ct. App. 1901).

   <p class="p7">
    The appointment of a receiver is in the nature of a provisional remedy, but is the last of that sort of remedies to be resorted to, and in the exercise of its legal discretion, in granting or denying a motion for a receiver, the court must be guided largely by the facts of the particular case, and keep in mind that the discretion must be exercised only as an auxiliary to attain the ends of justice more completely, when no other remedy will accomplish that end so satisfactorily. (Decided under prior law) Elkhorn Hazard Coal Co. v. Fairchild, 191 Ky. 276, 230 S.W. 61, 1921 Ky. LEXIS 312 (Ky. 1921).

(Decided under prior law) Elkhorn Hazard Coal Co. v. Fairchild, 191 Ky. 276, 230 S.W. 61, 1921 Ky. LEXIS 312 (Ky. 1921).

    In order to entitle a vendor of realty to an order appointing a receiver for the property upon which he holds a lien it should not only be shown that the party in possession is insolvent and the property insufficient to pay the debt, but also that the party in possession is committing or threatening to commit waste or by bad husbandry impairing the value of the vendor’s security; while in the case of a mortgage, if it appears that the mortgaged property is merely insufficient to discharge the indebtedness and the party in possession is insolvent, a court of equity will appoint a receiver to secure the rents, profits and earnings accruing after the date of appointment in order to make good the deficiency in the sale of the property.

(Decided under prior law) Handman v. Volk, 99 S.W. 660, 30 Ky. L. Rptr. 818, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 392 (Ky. Ct. App. 1907).

    Where purchaser had paid a part of the purchase price he had a lien as between the parties upon the property purchased and where the property was in danger of being lost or materially injured a receiver could be appointed for the purpose of preserving it until the rights of the respective parties could be ascertained.

    The appointment of a receiver rests largely in the discretion of the chancellor, although it is not an unlimited discretion.

    Where it was not claimed that the mortgage, by its terms, was such as to appropriate to the payment of appellant’s debt the rents, issues or profits of the mortgaged property, the appellant was without legal right to subject rents to the payment of its debts but only had an equitable claim to do so; hence, a receiver should not have been appointed for the assigned estate of an assignor for the benefit of creditors, where the assignee was in possession of the property, and there existed no valid reason why the assignee could not and would not faithfully preserve and administer the property, and perform the orders of the court with reference to the same.

    A receiver will not be appointed where it appears that a greater injury will probably be caused by the appointment than by leaving the property undisturbed, for when a receiver is appointed for the property of a debtor upon the motion of a lienholder it is for the purpose of keeping and preserving the property so that the source of the security for the debt will not be destroyed, injured or removed and thus destroy or render less valuable the source of the security, and in such instances to sustain the motion, it must be shown that the receivership is necessary to prevent fraud, or to save the property from material injury or to rescue it from threatened destruction.

   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    Beginning July 1, 1976, or at such earlier date as may be fixed as hereinafter provided, grand jurors, petit jurors and persons summoned for jury service in Circuit Court eligible for payment of the compensation designated in KRS 29A.170(1) shall be paid, in addition thereto, the sum of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) per day as reimbursement of expenses incurred, which sum is hereby determined to be the equivalent of the minimum daily expenses reasonably to be incurred by such juror or person. Payment of such reimbursement for expenses may be made beginning as of such date prior to July 1, 1976, but not prior to July 1, 1974, as may be fixed by the Governor upon recommendation of the secretary of justice and public safety if and to the extent that prior to July 1, 1976, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is awarded grant funds by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of the United States Department of Justice on a matching basis of not less than ninety percent (90%) federal funds and ten percent (10%) state funds which grant funds are sufficient to pay the full cost of the reimbursement of expenses, and of the administrative expenses related thereto, authorized by this section from the date so fixed through June 30, 1976. Eligible state funds appropriated for the 1974-1976 biennium may be used for matching purposes so long as such use does not reduce the level of services provided in the executive budget for that biennium.
