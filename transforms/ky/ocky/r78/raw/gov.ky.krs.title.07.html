<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> If any person obtains a survey of land to which another claims a better right, such other may enter a caveat with the register to prevent the issuing of a grant until the right be determined. The caveat shall state the plaintiff’s claim and the reasons why the grant should not issue. It shall be verified by his affidavit, or by that of his agent, and declare that it is entered in good faith, with the intention of procuring the land for the plaintiff, and not for the benefit of the person against whom it is entered.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> A copy of the caveat, certified by the register, shall, within sixty (60) days from the time it is entered, be lodged with the clerk of the Circuit Court of the county where the land or the greater part thereof lies. Failure so to lodge such copy shall be deemed an abandonment of the caveat; and it may be disregarded by the register, upon the clerk’s certificate of such failure being filed in his office.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If such copy be lodged within said period, it shall be treated as a petition, and the proceedings upon it shall be the same, including an appeal to the Court of Appeals, as those in an ordinary action.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> If the summons be not returned in due time, or be returned not executed, the caveat shall be dismissed, if it be shown that the nonexecution or nonreturn was procured by the plaintiff or resulted from his neglect.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> A copy of the judgment, if in favor of the defendant, must be delivered into the land office within three (3) months from the time it is rendered; or a new caveat may, for that cause, be entered against the grant. If the judgment be for the plaintiff, and a copy thereof be not delivered into the land office within six (6) months from the time it was rendered, any other person may, for that cause, enter another caveat against the grant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> No grant shall issue to the land in contest, to the plaintiff in the caveat, or to another for his use, until the caveat be dismissed or decided; and any such grant, to the extent of such land, shall be void.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> If the plaintiff does not prosecute his caveat as herein required, or if the same be dismissed or decided against him, neither he nor any other for his use shall have another caveat against the same grant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The court may, in its discretion, require the plaintiff to give security for costs; and upon his failure to do so may dismiss the proceeding.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> No member of the commission shall receive any salary, fee, or other remuneration for his services as a member of the commission, but each member shall be entitled to be reimbursed for his ordinary traveling expenses, including meals and lodging, incurred in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The commission shall constitute a public body corporate with perpetual succession and power in its name to contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, adopt bylaws, have and use a corporate seal, and exercise all of the powers granted to private corporations generally in KRS Chapter 271B, except as that chapter may be inconsistent with KRS 56.440 to 56.550.</p>

As an additional and alternative method for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this chapter, upon application of any state agency and approval by the commission, the commission acting for and on behalf of said state agency may issue revenue bonds in its own name, in accordance with the terms and provisions of KRS Chapter 58, secured by and payable solely from all or any part of the revenues of the state agency as may be specified and provided in the approved application. Any covenants and undertakings of the state agency in the approved application with regard to the production of revenues and the use, application, or disposition thereof may be enforced by the holders of any of the revenue bonds or by any trustee for such bondholders. The issuance of any revenue bonds for the state or any of its agencies by or on behalf of the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority and the issuance of any revenue bonds for economic development projects authorized by Acts 1980, Ch. 109, shall require the prior approval of the State Property and Buildings Commission. In issuing bonds under its own name, or in approving issuance of bonds by other state agencies, the commission shall be deemed to be acting for the state government of the Commonwealth of Kentucky as one (1) unit within the meaning of the regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, and it shall be limited to the issuance of bonds to accomplish the public purposes of that unit.</p>

Any designation of an alternate may, in the discretion of the appointing member, be limited upon the face of the appointing instrument, to be effective only for a designated meeting or only for specified business; or the same may be shown on the face of the appointing instrument to be on a continuing basis (but in no case for a period of more than four (4) years), whenever the appointing member is unable to attend, but always subject to revocation by the appointing member in an instrument of like formality, similarly filed with the secretary as a public record of the commission.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When the State Property and Buildings Commission makes a determination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that one (1) or more building projects or industrial development projects will be financed by the issuance of revenue bonds, then in anticipation of such financing the commission may borrow money to provide interim financing therefor and issue in evidence thereof its revenue bond anticipation notes, bearing interest at a rate or rates not exceeding the maximum rate permitted for the issuance of such bonds. Such interim financing may be entered into for the commission’s own projects, for those of the University of Kentucky and the state colleges or universities or for any other agency of the Commonwealth where approval by the commission is required regarding the issuance of revenue bonds of such an agency. In instances where the revenue bonds involved are to be issued by other agencies, such agencies, with the prior approval of the commission, may borrow money in the same manner and for the same purpose and issue in evidence thereof their own revenue bond anticipation notes, according to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The commission shall solicit proposals for such interim financing from at least three (3) responsible lenders, and shall select in its discretion the best of such proposals consistent with sound financial practices. A selection may be made even though less than three (3) proposals are received. The term of any such revenue bond anticipation note shall not exceed five (5) years; and the same may be renewed, if necessary.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Each revenue bond anticipation note may include prepayment provisions which will allow the commission or other borrowing agency to prepay the loan after giving reasonable notice to the lender; shall identify the revenue bond issue from the proceeds of which the note or notes and any interest thereon are to be paid; and shall include a statement that the note is being issued in anticipation of the identified revenue bond issue, and that neither the note, nor the interest thereon, shall constitute or evidence an indebtedness of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Each such note and the interest thereon (to any extent not previously paid from other sources) shall be paid from the proceeds of the identified revenue bond issue, when such proceeds have been received and are available.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Instead of borrowing money and issuing revenue bond anticipation notes in the full amount necessary for construction contract purposes, the commission (or such agencies with the prior approval of the commission and according to its rules and regulations), may enter into loan agreements with one (1) or more lenders (determined by the commission to be responsible) according to the terms of which it may be agreed:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> That the lender will continuously make available to the borrowing agency a stated maximum amount of money for a stated period of time;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> That the borrowing agency may demand and obtain cash advances against such commitment from time to time upon reasonable and agreed notice, and upon issuing in evidence of each advance a bond anticipation note which will bear an agreed rate of interest, not exceeding the maximum rate permitted for the issuance of the proposed bonds; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> That in consideration of the making of such loan agreement the borrowing agency will pay to the lender or lenders a commitment fee determined by the commission to be reasonable according to financial conditions existing at the time the loan agreement is made.</p>
<p class="p6">Such loan agreements may be recorded as receivables upon the books of account of the commission, the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, or other borrowing agency, and construction contracts may be awarded against the same to the amount of money which the lender contractually agrees to make available to the borrowing agency, the same as in the case of loan agreements made with departments or agencies of the United States government.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Each revenue bond anticipation note issued according to this section, and the receipt of interest thereon, shall be exempt from all taxation by the Commonwealth and all of its subdivisions, municipalities, and taxing authorities; and this may be stated as a representation in the text of each such revenue bond anticipation note.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The State Property and Building Commission and other state agencies authorized to issue revenue bond anticipation notes under the terms of this section may, as an alternative and if authorized to do so by the governing body of such commission or agency, adopt the procedures for interim financing established for counties, cities, and other municipal corporations, or their agencies, by KRS 58.150.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The Energy Efficiency Program for State Government Buildings shall provide for implementation of low cost/no cost energy conservation measures, engineering analyses, energy efficiency measures, building improvements, and monitoring of results for state-owned or state-leased buildings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Any engineering analysis conducted on a state-owned building shall assess the energy efficiency of the building and make recommendations for improving the efficient use of energy within the building. The analyses shall be performed by qualified engineers, architects, or other persons trained in energy efficiency who may be employees of the cabinet or employed pursuant to KRS Chapter 45A, except that any engineers, architects or other persons trained in energy efficiency and retained under a guaranteed energy savings performance contract, shall not be subject to the provisions of KRS 45A.800 to 45A.835.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, measures to improve the energy efficiency of a state-owned building, which have an aggregate simple payback period of five (5) years or less, shall be implemented as general fund appropriations become available. No more than five percent (5%) of the cost of energy conservation measures for a building may be utilized for monitoring the results.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> If general fund appropriations are available for energy conservation improvements, the cabinet shall prioritize projects among the various state-owned buildings to determine which projects shall be implemented to best utilize the available funding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> If general fund appropriations are unavailable, energy conservation measures for a state-owned building may be financed by other means. These other means include but are not limited to guaranteed energy savings performance contracts as defined under KRS 56.770 entered into pursuant to KRS 45A.085 and KRS 45A.045(10). Guaranteed energy savings performance contracts shall not be subject to the provisions of KRS 45A.800 to 45A.835. These energy conservation measures shall not be limited to those that have an aggregate simple payback period of five (5) years or less, but shall result in reasonable economic benefit to the Commonwealth. Ownership of the energy conservation measures shall be transferred to the Commonwealth upon completion of the guaranteed energy savings performance contract or as otherwise agreed upon in the contract. Savings from the implementation of the energy conservation measures under the guaranteed energy savings performance contract shall be used to satisfy the obligations under the guaranteed energy savings performance contract and to repay the cost of the other means used to finance the energy conservation measures, and may be used to repay expenses incurred by the cabinet to reimburse the cabinet for expenses related to the guaranteed energy savings performance contract, including but not limited to staff time for monitoring, overseeing, and managing the project. Notwithstanding KRS 45.229, remaining savings shall remain in the state agency account and shall not lapse. All savings projected under a guaranteed energy savings performance contract shall be guaranteed to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The savings in reduced expenditures that are specified as payment sources shall be documented in the guaranteed energy savings performance contract. Savings shall be determined by using one (1) of the measurement and verification methodologies listed in the United States Department of Energy’s “International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol.” If specific data limitations or documented unique characteristics of the project prevent use of the “International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol,” an alternative method that is compatible shall be adopted upon documentation and approval of the secretary of the cabinet.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>56.803.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Procedure when agency requests space.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When an agency determines that it will need office or other space, the agency shall submit a request for the acquisition of the additional space to the Department for Facilities Management in the Finance and Administration Cabinet. Except in the case of an emergency as described at KRS 56.805(3), an agency shall submit its space request in writing to the department. In the case of an emergency, an agency shall communicate its space needs to the department pursuant to KRS 56.805(3) as soon as an agency knows that it will need the space. If the commissioner of the Department for Facilities Management determines that insufficient space has been allocated to the agency making the request and that it is appropriate to lease additional space for the agency making the request, the commissioner shall acquire the space required by lease as provided by KRS 43.050, 48.111, and 56.800 to 56.823.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The Department for Facilities Management shall review each agency space request to determine whether space suitable to meet the agency’s reasonable needs may be available in a state-owned or occupied building. If it is determined that there is suitable space available in a state-owned or occupied building, the commissioner shall notify the agency. A copy of the notice shall be kept on file.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If it is determined that there is no suitable space available in a state-owned or occupied building, the department shall comply with the procedures set forth in this section in the leasing of space, except as otherwise provided in KRS 43.050, 48.111, and 56.800 to 56.823.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The department shall draw up general requirement specifications for the space required. These general requirement specifications shall not be changed except, at the discretion of the commissioner, when the lease process is initiated again pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection (15) of this section or pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (16) of this section. The general requirement specifications shall be kept on file.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5) (a)</b> In soliciting the interest of lessors who have property to let in a county where space is sought, the department shall give adequate public notice to reasonably inform persons having property to let within the county of the type of space required, the general location of the property, and the number of square feet needed. The notice may include posting on the Internet or newspaper advertisements. Each notice shall contain general information concerning the agency requirements for the space sought and shall state the last time, date, and place that written responses shall be received. When it is anticipated that a lease may be negotiated containing deviations or variations from the terms and conditions of the state standard lease form prescribed by the Division of Real Properties, within the department, any deviations or variations shall be stated in the notice.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The Department for Facilities Management may use any means available to notify landlords that a notice has been given.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> A property owner, or his representative, shall respond in writing on or before the time and date designated in the notice and shall state in the writing the type and location of the property, the name and address of the property owner, and the date of availability of the property. The department shall deal only with individuals who have submitted written responses on or before the time and date designated in the notice.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> All written responses received on or before the time and date designated shall be opened or downloaded at the same time, publicly read or posted, and kept on file by the department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> Within ten (10) business days of the opening of written responses, the department shall transmit general requirement specifications to each person who submitted a written response on or before the time and date designated. The same general requirement specifications shall be transmitted to each person. The department shall state whether a reverse auction will be used to determine any terms of the proposals and shall specify the procedures for the reverse auction.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> After the general requirement specifications have been transmitted, except as provided in paragraph (a) of subsection (13) of this section, the commissioner, and department employees under his supervision, may negotiate with persons who submitted written responses on or before the time and date designated. If in the course of negotiations, a person proposes terms and conditions of lease different from those contained in the state standard lease form which are determined to be in the Commonwealth’s best interest to accept, but no mention of the acceptability thereof has been made in the notice given pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, all other persons who submitted written responses on or before the time and date designated shall be notified of the terms and conditions and shall be allowed to incorporate the terms and conditions in written proposals when submitted pursuant to subsection (12) of this section. A copy of each notice shall be kept on file.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> The department shall inspect each space proposed to be leased to determine its suitability to the reasonable needs of the agency for whose use the property is sought. The owner of the property, or the owner’s representative, shall provide access to the property for the inspection. A report of the findings about each property inspected shall be submitted on a site evaluation form to the commissioner of the department. Completed site evaluation forms shall be kept on file.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> After the commissioner has reviewed the completed site evaluation forms, the commissioner shall inform each owner of property, or his representative, of the steps necessary to bring the property up to general and specific requirement specifications. The commissioner shall also invite each person to submit a written proposal on a form created by the Department for Facilities Management. A copy of the form shall be provided to each bidder. The department may require any terms of the proposal to be the subject of a reverse auction. A written proposal shall constitute a best and final offer. The department shall not consider a written proposal unless it is submitted on a department form on or before the time and date designated.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(12)</b> All written portions of the proposals submitted on or before the time and date designated shall be opened at the same time, publicly identified by the name of the property owner and the location of the property, and kept on file.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(13)</b> Except pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (15) of this section, when the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply, from the time that written proposals are opened until the awarding of a lease, the department:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Shall not negotiate or agree to changes in the terms of written proposals except to correct technical errors;</p>

The log shall state the time, date, place, and a summary of the substance of each contact. Each log entry shall be signed by the department employee who was contacted. After the lease is awarded, the log shall be kept as a department record.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(14) (a)</b> The commissioner shall assess the proposals, taking into account factors including, but not limited to: consultation with the head of the agency for whose use the space is sought; the location and accessibility of the property to the public; its condition and state of repair; its conformity with the requirements of occupational health and safety regulations; its conformity with applicable state fire, health, safety and sanitation requirements; the proposed rental rates; utility and janitorial costs; agency moving costs; any terms of the proposal determined through a reverse auction; and whether the property proposed is in substantial conformity with the general and specific requirement specifications.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The commissioner shall give preference to properties in areas which have received, within the previous five (5) year period, state community development funds for revitalization if properties are offered at a competitive rate and meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(15)</b> The commissioner, relying exclusively on his assessment made pursuant to subsection (14) of this section, shall:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Choose the best proposal in the interest of the Commonwealth;</p>

The General Assembly shall on a biennial basis appropriate the net debt service savings as described, any debt service reserve fund or other funds generated, reported by the Finance and Administration Cabinet, to a special escrow account for each bond issue within the Finance and Administration Cabinet. The proceeds within this account shall be used to accelerate the payment of outstanding principal and interest, either through open market bond purchases or investments at maximum yield, in addition to the amounts budgeted for such purposes over the biennium, on definitive bonds, temporary bonds or interim financing secured by bond anticipation notes, loan agreements or other means issued by an agency, authority, board, corporation, cabinet, commission or other agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The Finance and Administration Cabinet shall report to the General Assembly on a biennial basis the amount of total funds utilized in the escrow account to retire the outstanding principal and interest and the amount of principal and interest so retired, or to be retired, for each agency, authority, board, corporation, cabinet, commission or other agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth. In the event that the funds appropriated to the escrow account cannot be used in the biennium for the purposes prescribed by this subsection, the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall so report and provide the reasons therefor. The funds appropriated shall not lapse at the end of the biennium but be carried forward to the next biennium to be utilized for the purposes prescribed by this subsection.</p>

The power to include such financing costs in the total bond package is an implied power of the State Property and Buildings Commission in issuing revenue bonds under KRS 56.450(4); this implied power is clearly and inevitably necessary in order that the commission may carry out its express power of issuing revenue bonds.

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When the governing body of any county, city, or other municipal corporation, or agency thereof, shall make a determination that, in accordance with the provisions of any section of the statutes authorizing it to issue revenue bonds, assessment bonds, or mortgage bonds to finance any project, it will finance a project by the issuance of bonds, then in anticipation of financing, the governing body may provide for the interim financing of a project by the sale and issuance of revenue bond, assessment bond, or mortgage bond anticipation notes, as the case may be, bearing interest at a rate or rates not exceeding the maximum rate permitted for the issuance of the bonds so anticipated, and payable within a specified period of time only from the proceeds of the bonds, when issued, or from the revenues or income of the project as may be available prior to or at maturity of the notes; provided that the initial term of the notes shall not be in excess of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The term “revenue bond” means bonds, notes, or other obligations for the payment of money issued by the state, any county, municipality, or other public district or authority except a school district, or any corporation or other corporate body acting as an instrumentality of the unit, and payable from a special fund into which some or all of the revenues of a public project have been or will be paid. “Assessment bond” means bonds, notes, or other obligations for the payment of money issued by any one (1) or more of the same issuing authorities payable from a special fund into which assessments levied on properties for benefits conferred have been or will be paid in accordance with law. “Mortgage bond” means revenue bonds which are secured by a mortgage deed of trust. A school district shall not be excluded from these definitions if it is authorized by the Kentucky Board of Education, by general or special authorization, to proceed under the authority of this section or KRS 56.513 through the agency of the appropriate city or county.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The notes authorized herein shall be sold in the same manner as the bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, except that when the principal amount of the notes does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) the provisions of KRS 424.360 for advertisement of the notes in a publication having general circulation among bond buyers shall be inapplicable, and the other publications required by this section shall be deemed sufficient.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Each bond anticipation note may include prepayment provisions which will allow the issuing authority to prepay the note after giving reasonable notice to the holder; shall identify the bond issue from the proceeds of which the note or notes and any interest thereon are to be paid; and shall include a statement that the note is being issued in anticipation of the identified bond issue, and that neither the note, nor the interest, shall constitute or evidence an indebtedness of the issuing authority. Each note and the interest, to the extent not previously paid from other sources, shall be paid from the proceeds of the identified bond issue, when the proceeds have been received and are available; provided, however, that payment from the revenues of the project, for the financing of which the bonds will eventually be issued, shall be permitted, and provision shall be made for payment of that portion of the principal of any note issue which represents the principal of the proposed bonds scheduled to mature on or prior to the maturity of the notes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The notes authorized herein may be issued in a principal amount sufficient to include all interest due on the notes at or prior to maturity, if the notes shall be issued for a term of three (3) years or less, and the notes may be sold at a discount representing the interest due to the purchaser during the term.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> When, prior to the maturity of any notes issued under the authority of this section or KRS 56.513, the governing body of the issuing authority shall make a determination that by reason of construction delays, changes in plans, uncertainties in the bond market, or other causes justifying delay in the final offering of the bond issue, the bond issue should not immediately be offered, renewal notes may be issued subject to the same limitations contained in this section or KRS 56.513 relative to the original issue of notes, and the proceeds of the sale of the renewal notes shall be applied to the payment of the principal of the notes originally issued, or any prior issue of renewal notes, or to the payment of interest due or to become due on the notes or renewal notes; provided, however, that the interest, including discount, if any, payable from the proceeds of notes or renewal notes shall not exceed an amount equal to three (3) years’ interest from the date of the original notes at the rate per annum established for the original notes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Counties, cities, and other municipal corporations, or agencies, in the discretion of the governing body in each case, may, as an alternative to this section and for interim financing purposes, solicit proposals, issue bond anticipation notes, and make commitment agreements in the same manner as provided for the State Property and Buildings Commission by KRS 56.513; provided, however, that in the case of notes issued on behalf of a school district, general or special approval of the Kentucky Board of Education shall be required in substitution for the approval of the State Property and Buildings Commission; and provided further, that the approval of the State Property and Buildings Commission will not be required for any issue of a county, city, or other municipal corporation, or any agency, and references to the commission shall be interpreted to be references to the governing body of the issuing authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> Nothing herein shall be deemed to invalidate any bond anticipation notes sold or issued under general statutes prior to the adoption of this section and KRS 56.513.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> Each bond anticipation note issued according to this section or KRS 56.513, and the receipt of interest on the note, shall be exempt from all taxation by the Commonwealth and all of its subdivisions, municipalities, and taxing authorities; and this may be stated as a representation in the text of each bond anticipation note.</p>

Such corporation, upon direction of such governmental agency, shall be authorized to issue its bonds, notes or other obligations on behalf of such governmental agency for the acquisition and financing of one or more public projects on behalf of such governmental agency, and may pledge for the amortization of such bonds, notes or other obligations all revenues derived from the operation of such public project or public projects, including specifically all revenues derived from the leasing of such public project or public projects directly to the governmental agency upon whose behalf and upon whose direction such bonds, notes or other obligations are issued.

<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not implicitly repeal or in any way modify the maximum interest rate a school district may pay on money borrowed in anticipation of taxes. OAG 80-571.</p>

OAG 81-346.</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since KRS 96A.120(3) provides that a mass transit authority may use the procedures set forth in KRS 58.010 to 58.170, subject to any interest rate limitations which may be applicable thereto as provided by law, and since, as between KRS 58.170 and 96A.120, the specific governs over the general, anticipatory notes issued by transit authority fall within the provisions of this section and are not subject to the interest limitations of KRS 58.170. OAG 83-152.</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 103.200 and 103.220 in no explicit language establish pollution projects as the sole category of projects subject to a variable rate of interest and the pertinent statutes amended by Acts 1984, Ch. 122 in no way prohibit the application of the variable rate to projects other than pollution control projects; they merely emphasize pollution control projects, but not to the detriment of other kinds of projects falling within the broad range of KRS 103.200 to 103.285. Moreover, this section is a specific statute dealing only with interest rates on public bonds and is so flexibly worded as to support variable rate structures in the issuance of public bonds and even if the sections in KRS Ch. 103 amended by Acts 1984, Ch. 122 (KRS 103.200, 103.210, 103.2101, 103.220 — 103.240, 103.280) were to be said to be in some conflict with the provisions of this section, the specific statute, this section, should control over the provisions of KRS Ch. 103. OAG 84-257.</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By its express language, this section repealed the maximum rate found in KRS 220.390, 220.400 and KRS 220.370; the purpose of this section was to permit public bodies to meet prevailing interest rate competition. OAG 84-360.</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 103.200(2), variable rate bonds do not apply only to pollution control facilities bonds; thus, the Kentucky Development Finance Authority may lawfully issue variable rate bonds with Put and Remarketing features in a proposed Internal Revenue Bond issue for the financing of the construction and equipping of airport facilities, under KRS 103.200 to 103.285, as amended by Chapter 122, 1984, Session, and this section. OAG 84-377.</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, as a specific statute on public bond interest rates, clearly authorizes the insurers of the bonds to bind themselves to pay interest at “any rate or rates which may be determined by the governing body” issuing the bonds; the term “at any rate or rates,” as used in this section, is sufficiently broad to encompass variable rates arrived at under agreement.
