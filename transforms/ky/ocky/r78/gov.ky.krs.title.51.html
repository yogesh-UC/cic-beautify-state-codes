    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall be known as the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall be interpreted to effectuate the following express legislative purposes:
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The Commonwealth shall direct its efforts to promoting protection of children; to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to strengthening and maintaining the biological family unit; to ensuring that policies and practices utilized are supported by data and research and are monitored or measured for their effectiveness in achieving the intended results; and to offering all available resources to any family in need of them;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    It also shall be declared to be the policy of this Commonwealth that:
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     1.
    </span>
    All efforts shall be directed toward providing each child a safe and nurturing home;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     2.
    </span>
    Emphasis shall be placed on involving families in interventions developed for youth, providing families with access to services necessary to address issues within the family, and increasing accountability of the youth and families within the juvenile justice system;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     3.
    </span>
    To the extent possible, out-of-home placement should only be utilized for youth who are high-risk or high-level offenders, and that low-risk, low-level offenders should be served through evidence-based programming in their community; and
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     4.
    </span>
    As the population in Department of Juvenile Justice facilities is reduced through increased use of community-based treatment, and if staffing ratios can be maintained at the levels required by accreditation bodies, reductions of the number of facilities should be considered;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    The court shall show that other less restrictive alternatives have been attempted or are not feasible in order to insure that children are not removed from families except when absolutely necessary;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    Any child brought before the court under KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall have a right to treatment reasonably calculated, through the use of evidence-based programs when available, to bring about an improvement of his or her condition and, to the extent possible, have that treatment administered in the county of residence of the custodial parent or parents or in the nearest available county;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    KRS Chapter 635 shall be interpreted to promote the best interests of the child through providing treatment and sanctions to reduce recidivism and assist in making the child a productive citizen by involving the family, as appropriate, and by advancing the principles of personal responsibility, accountability, and reformation, while maintaining public safety, and seeking restitution and reparation;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (f)
    </span>
    KRS Chapter 640 shall be interpreted to promote public safety and the concept that every child be held accountable for his or her conduct through the use of restitution, reparation, and sanctions, in an effort to rehabilitate delinquent youth; and
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (g)
    </span>
    It shall further be the policy of this Commonwealth to provide judicial procedures in which rights and interests of all parties, including the parents and victims, are recognized and all parties are assured prompt and fair hearings. Unless otherwise provided, such protections belong to the child individually and may not be waived by any other party.

    Common law infancy defense does not apply to proceedings under the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 346 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1108 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2006), aff'd, 246 S.W.3d 448, 2007 Ky. LEXIS 241 (Ky. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code has extinguished the common law presumption that a child is without criminal capacity (the “infancy defense”), since a delinquency adjudication in juvenile court is not a criminal conviction under KRS 635.040, and allowing the presumption would frustrate the clinical and rehabilitative purposes of the Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 246 S.W.3d 448, 2007 Ky. LEXIS 241 (Ky. 2007).

     2. Legislative Intent.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    The intent of subsection (1) in giving the District Court the ability to review any information it may require regarding one of its orders is to safeguard the interests of the child, considering it welfare as being too precious a commodity to jeopardize by an incomplete or inadequate judicial review. Cabinet for Human Resources v. McDonald, 765 S.W.2d 581, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 175 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    In line with the legislature’s expression in this section of the public policy to strengthen families in order to protect and care for children, children have a common-law right of action for the loss of parental consortium. Giuliani v. Guiler, 951 S.W.2d 318, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 74 (Ky. 1997).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Juvenile may voluntarily waive the preliminary hearing required under KRS 640.010(2) and KRS 635.020(2) before the juvenile’s case may be transferred to the circuit court as: (1) KRS 600.010(2)(e) signals the legislature’s intent to allow a juvenile to waive any of the rights set out in the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, (2) the preliminary hearing is a dispositional, rather than an adjudicatory hearing, (3) if a defendant can waive his constitutional right to a jury trial, there is no reason he cannot also waive his right to a preliminary hearing, and (4) the circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile felony matters. Humphrey v. Commonwealth, 153 S.W.3d 854, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 147 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since KRS 635.060(4), (5), restrict the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated. N.T.G. v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 218, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 51 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Ky. Const., § 230 and KRS 41.110, preventing the expenditure of the State’s money without the consent of the legislature, and KRS 453.010 and CR 54.04(1), restricting judgments for costs against the Commonwealth, did not prohibit the trial court’s order requiring the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to pay for counseling for a mother whose child was placed with the Cabinet; a purpose of the Unified Juvenile Code was to strengthen and maintain the biological family unit and to offer all available resources to a family in need of them, under KRS 600.010(2)(a). Cabinet for Health & Family Servs. v. Evans, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 52 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 831 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2006).

     3. Inferences About Another Child.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    The Commonwealth’s position that from evidence proving dependency, or abuse or neglect, of one child, the same condition may be inferred about another child who lives in the same household, ran against the grain of not only the Juvenile Code, but also the notion of constitutional due process of law and familial realities as well. J.H. v. Commonwealth, 767 S.W.2d 330, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 204 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).
   </p>
   <h4 class="p7" id="tLIc600s600.010-4.lessrestrictivealternatives.">
    <span class="boldspan">
     4. Less Restrictive Alternatives.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    Where the lower court did not state that other less restrictive alternatives, such as probation, had been attempted or were not feasible in accordance with KRS 600.010(2)(c), a juvenile defendant’s commitment to the department of justice was erroneous. X.B. v. Commonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 459, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 81 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    In a juvenile proceeding in which the juvenile argued that the trial court erred because commitment was not the least restrictive alternative since an aunt was willing to take her and that the trial court should have made findings as to why commitment was the only option, the trial court’s failure to make written findings or state during the hearings what alternatives had been tried was not fatal to the commitment. The record was full of second chances, house confinement, foster care, and other alternatives that the Cabinet for Families and Children and the court tried in order to help the juvenile. K.F. v. Commonwealth, 274 S.W.3d 457, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 376 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Commitment of the juvenile was necessary to protect him from physical injury, and to the extent less restrictive alternatives were available, they were considered by the family court and determined unfeasible, KRS 600.010(2)(c), 600.020(35). J.S. v. Commonwealth, 304 S.W.3d 67, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 216 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Family court fully explored alternatives to commitment for defendant juvenile when it recognized that he had made progress in his foster home and that he had to be committed to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services in order to remain there. At defendant’s arraignment, the Cabinet explained that it had attempted to involve the family in a diversion program, and the court had subsequently allowed defendant to live with his father and then a relative, both of which arrangements ended unsuccessfully. D.G. v. Commonwealth, 355 S.W.3d 476, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 228 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).

    Juvenile court retained jurisdiction over an offender to enforce a restitution order entered by the juvenile court after the offender turned 18 because KRS 600.060 authorized the use of contempt powers to enforce the restitution order.

    Evidence that the residences parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 97 (Ky. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Pre-trial order excluding evidence of sexual abuse on one of the child’s siblings that resulted in the removal of the siblings from the home was vacated as the disputed evidence was not barred under the doctrine of issue preclusion since the identity of the perpetrator was not established in a prior proceeding; the identity of the perpetrator was not material to the finding that the siblings were abused or neglected since KRS 600.020(1) required only a finding that a parent or guardian had created or allowed to be created a risk that the child would be the victim of sexual abuse or exploitation. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs. v. R.H., 199 S.W.3d 201, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 259 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS 625.090(1)(a)1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under KRS 625.090(1)(a)3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct. App. May 18, 2007), rev'd, 2008 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 150 (Ky. Aug. 21, 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Cabinet for Health and Family Services did not present substantial evidence that a parent’s children were abused and neglected as required under KRS 600.020(1). It was not shown that the children suffered any direct, emotional or physical injury from the parent, and the Cabinet witnesses testified that the parent was a nurturing parent and that the children were well-cared for by the parent. M.E.C. v. Commonwealth, 254 S.W.3d 846, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    To find that KRS 620.030 does not apply, there must be a finding that the act committed upon the child is not an act of sexual abuse. For purposes of KRS Chapter 600, the definition of a neglected or abused child is set forth at KRS 600.020. If sexual abuse has occurred, then the mandatory reporting requirement in KRS 620.030 would have required the teacher to report this incident and such mandatory reporting would result in this being considered a ministerial rather than a discretionary act which would preclude the teacher from claiming qualified official immunity. Nelson v. Turner, 256 S.W.3d 37, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 177 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Finding that the father abused only one of the four children did not preclude the court from ordering the father to refrain from contact with all four children because KRS 600.020(1) permitted such a finding where a risk of abuse existed and did not require actual abuse. Z.T. v. M.T., 258 S.W.3d 31, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 206 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Family court properly found that a child was an abused or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and terminated the parental rights of the child’s minor mother under KRS 625.090 without receiving expert testimony as to the mother’s parenting potential upon adulthood because § 625.090(2)(e), (g) did not require proof that the minor parent would be unable to effectively parent the child when the parent reached the age of majority. Commonwealth v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. 2010).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS 600.020 was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS 620.100, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice. S.R. v. J.N., 307 S.W.3d 631, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

   <p class="p9">
    Under the plain language of KRS 600.020(1), the definition of an abused child is limited to a scenario in which his or her parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision inflicted or committed abuse, allowed abuse to be inflicted or committed, or created or allowed to be created a risk of abuse. As a result, the mandatory reporting requirement of KRS 620.030(1) does not apply when a child inappropriately touches another child unless a parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision allows such inappropriate touching to be committed or creates or allows such a risk of abuse. Turner v. Nelson, 342 S.W.3d 866, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 96 (Ky. 2011).

    Evidence that was based on compounded inferences was insufficient to support a finding of a mother’s neglect of her children under KRS 600.020(1)(f); her failure to sign an “Aftercare Plan” to keep the father away from the children, without evidence that he posed a risk to them, was insufficient.

    KRS 600.020(1)(a)(2) allowed a finding by a court of neglect or abuse where the risk of abuse existed, and in this termination case, the child tested positive for marijuana at birth and the parents admitted to using such before and during the pregnancy, such that there was sufficient evidence to remove the child from the home in order to ensure her safety.

    Trial court did not err by determining that the children were abused and/or neglected under KRS 600.020, 625.090 because the parents admitted that their children were neglected as a result of their substance abuse issues and admitted that because of their lack of supervision of one child she was injured and sustained a bruise to her face.

    Informal adjustment requiring a juvenile to live with the juvenile's father in another state was improper because the informal adjustment, (1) in effect, changed custody without a hearing on the father's propriety as a custodian, and (2) did not provide for the child's possible inability to live with the father.

    Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because a child was found to be abused and neglected based on the infliction of an emotional injury; the child suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the mother's mental illness made it incapable for her to care for the child. Moreover, the mother inflicted emotional injury to the child, failed to provide adequate parental care and supervision, and failed to provide the essentials of life for the child's overall well-being; termination was in the best interest of the child, reunification efforts were made, and the child's welfare would have improved if termination was ordered.

    Termination of a father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment was inappropriate because, although the father did not visit with and support the child after the child was placed in foster care, the failures by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services denied the father an opportunity to maintain contact with the child and to work toward a court-approved case plan to regain custody. Furthermore, the oral parenting plan given to the father was so lacking in formality and detail that it did not constitute a plan.

    For a parent to neglect a child, he or she must intend to do so, and dependency is different than neglect, because while dependency may occur in circumstances similar to neglect, it lacks the requisite intent on the part of the parent; a child who suffers harm as a result of a parent’s intentional acts is neglected or abused, and in contrast, a child is dependent if the harm results from a parent’s unintentional acts, or from a cause unrelated to parental culpability.

    A married child under the age of 16 has a legal responsibility to attend school, but once a child marries, the parent or guardian no longer has a legal obligation to ensure that the child attends school; however, if the spouse of a minor who is under the age of 16 and who is an habitual truant, is found to be a person exercising custodial control or supervision as defined by this section, the spouse may be subject to penalties under the Juvenile Code.

     (a)
    </span>
    A child is deemed to need extraordinary services if the child is mentally or emotionally ill or has symptoms of mental or emotional illness and requires medical attention, and the child’s parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision over the child is unable to provide for the required treatment, care, or supervision of the child, and:
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     1.
    </span>
    The inability is due primarily to the lack of financial means of the child’s parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision unless assistance has been offered and rejected;

   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     2.

   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     3.
    </span>
    The inability is not due to a willful act of commission or act of omission by the child’s parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision; and
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     4.

    A child is deemed to need protection if the court determines the child is a dependent, abused, or neglected child and the needs of the child do not meet the definition of a child in need of extraordinary services.

    Although a juvenile was only 15-years old, a District Court had authority under KRS 600.060 to sentence the juvenile to 60-days detention for criminal contempt. C.G. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 57 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2003 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1383 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2003), review denied, ordered not published, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 212 (Ky. Aug. 17, 2005).

    KRS 635.060(4) provided that a juvenile offender who was older than age 14 but younger than age 16 could be confined for a period not to exceed 45 days but KRS 600.060 stated that notwithstanding any other provision of KRS Chs. 600 to 645, the inherent contempt power of the court was not diminished, so, because KRS 600.060 specifically addressed the juvenile court’s contempt powers, it controlled over the more general limitation on sentencing of public offenders contained in KRS 635.060(4), and a juvenile court was allowed to sentence a public offender to 60 days in detention for being in contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).

    KRS 600.060 did not restrict a juvenile court’s imposition of contempt sanctions, for violations of conditions of probation, as the juvenile court had the inherent authority to impose the sanctions; further, KRS 635.060 did not act as a limitation on the length of sentence imposed under a contempt order.

Within seventy-two (72) hours after the removal, the cabinet shall file a petition for review in District Court pursuant to KRS 610.120 with a request for an expeditious hearing.

    Plaintiffs established standing because they sufficiently demonstrated a link between the challenged legislative actions and the alleged constitutional violations, namely that the state’s statutory funding for neglected children in private childcare facilities knowingly and impermissibly funded a religious organization. Although a religiously inspired employee conduct rule was not sufficient to constitute discrimination on the basis of religion, it was relevant to an inquiry under the Establishment Clause.

    (7/15/2016). 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 115, sec. 4 directed that a new section of KRS Chapter 600 be created for the text of this statute. The subject matter of KRS Chapter 600 relates to introductory matters of the Unified Juvenile Code, KRS Chapters 600 to 645. Since this statute specifically addresses the standard of judgment a caregiver of a committed child must exercise in allowing participation in age or developmentally appropriate activities, in codification the Reviser of Statutes created a new section of KRS Chapter 605, which addresses administrative matters pertaining to committed children, as a more appropriate statutory designation under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a).

    In the context of the conflicts in the wording of KRS 610.015(1) and KRS 640.010, the appellate court believes the legislature intends that the criminal rules governing preliminary hearings should apply to preliminary transfer hearings in juvenile court; thus, KRS 610.342 is not a rule of discovery, RCr 3.07 controls, and
    a juvenile is not entitled to complete discovery until probable cause is established. Commonwealth v. DeWeese, 141 S.W.3d 372, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 267 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).

    Circuit court judge was ordered to provide members of the media with a copy of the recording of a criminal arraignment and to refrain from closing any future proceeding that was ordinarily open to the public and from sealing records because he failed to conduct a hearing and closed the arraignment without making specific finding or considering less restrictive measures; the judge’s reliance on the statutory protections closing hearings was error because they were not applicable.

    If it appears to the court, by affidavit or by sworn testimony, that the child is a danger to himself or the community, or is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare is being harmed or threatened with harm to such a degree that his best interest requires that his custody be immediately changed by the court from the original custodian to another, the judge may sign an order giving temporary custody of the child to a suitable custodian consenting to temporary custody. However, if this case involves allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, no emergency removal or temporary custody orders shall be effective unless the provisions of KRS Chapter 620 are followed; and, if the case involves allegations of mental illness, the provisions of KRS Chapter 645 shall be followed. As a part of such order, the court may direct that the child shall be taken into custody by the peace officer serving the summons or by any other peace officer and placed as directed by the court. In any event, a copy of the temporary custody order shall be served on the parent, guardian or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child when the summons is served. The temporary custody order shall be effective until the case is heard on its merits or until modified by the court. As a result of such order, the child shall be placed in custody and care in a home or other suitable facility.

    Unless there is a suitable prior disposition investigation report or unless waived by the child who is represented by counsel, before making disposition of the case of a child brought before the court under the provisions of KRS Chapters 630 or 635, whether by complaint pursuant to KRS 610.020, or by reason of having been taken into custody pursuant to KRS 610.190, the judge shall cause an investigation to be made concerning the nature of the specific act complained of and any surrounding circumstances which suggest the future care and guidance which should be given the child. The investigation shall include an inquiry into the child’s age, habits, school record, general reputation, and everything that may pertain to his or her life, and character. The investigation shall also include an inquiry into the home conditions, life, and character of the person having custody of the child. The investigation shall also include an assessment of the parent or guardian’s ability to pay all or part of the cost of the child’s care and treatment should the child be ordered into a treatment program or placed on supervised probation. The result of the investigation, including the result of the validated risk and needs assessment, shall be reported in writing to the court and to counsel for the parties three (3) days prior to the child’s dispositional hearing and shall become a part of the record of the proceedings. The child may waive the three (3) day requirement. Objections by counsel at the dispositional hearing to portions of the dispositional report shall be noted in the record.

    The investigation shall be conducted by a suitable public or private agency.

For this purpose, any county judge/executive or chief executive officer of an urban-county government may enter into a contract on behalf of his or her county with the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet for the furnishings of such services.

    If a child has been removed from the home and placed in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet, a judge of the District Court shall conduct a permanency hearing no later than twelve (12) months after the date the child is considered to have entered foster care, and every twelve (12) months thereafter if custody and out-of-home placement continues, to determine the future status of the child. For purposes of this section, a child shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of the date of the first judicial finding that the child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect or the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on which the child is removed from the home.

    Whether the cabinet has documented a compelling reason that it is in the best interest of the child who is age sixteen (16) or older to be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement other than those listed in this subsection. Prior to the approval of this permanency goal, the court shall:
   </p>
   <p class="p6">

    In order to determine whether Kentucky owed foster care maintenance payments under the Child Welfare Act for children who were placed with their aunt, it was necessary to decide whether the family court affirmatively discharged the children from state custody, as the Act required payments only when the children's placement and care were the state's responsibility; denial of benefits because the aunt was related to the children would violate federal law.

    A married child under the age of 16 has a legal responsibility to attend school, but once a child marries, the parent or guardian no longer has a legal obligation to ensure that the child attends school; however, if the spouse of a minor who is under the age of 16 and who is an habitual truant, is found to be a person exercising custodial control or supervision as defined in subdivision (26) of KRS 600.020, the spouse may be subject to penalties under the Juvenile Code.

    If it appears from the investigation required in KRS 610.100 or otherwise that the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of any child, or the estate of any child, who has been found to fall within the purview of KRS Chapters 600 to 645 and who has been left in his own home or in the home of a relative, placed on probation or placed in a foster home or boarding home, or in the care of a public or private facility or agency, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet, is able to contribute to the support of the child, the court shall enter an order requiring the parent or estate to pay a reasonable sum for the support, maintenance, or education of the child. The order shall direct that the money be paid to the circuit clerk to be disbursed as ordered by the court or be paid to the person, facility, agency, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or cabinet to which the child was committed or probated. On application and on such notice as the court may direct, the court may make alterations in the requirement for contribution. The court may issue such orders necessary to compel payment of the sum due. The enforcement of a sentence imposed on a parent who fails to comply with the order of the court may be suspended at the discretion of the court, but the suspension may be revoked at the discretion of the court upon the failure of the parent to obey further orders of the court. This section shall not apply when the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child was the victim of the child’s criminal conduct under KRS Chapters 635 or 640, or filed the complaint against the child under other provisions of the Unified Juvenile Code.

    A parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of a child is charged with the control of such child and shall have the power to exercise parental control and authority over such child. In any case where a child is adjudicated a public offender and placed on probation, if the court finds at the hearing that the person having custody of such child has failed or neglected to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority, and that such failure or neglect is the proximate cause of the act or acts of the child upon which the adjudication is based, the court may require such parent to enter into a recognizance with sufficient surety, in an amount of not more than five hundred dollars ($500), conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the conditions of probation of such child. If the child thereafter commits a second act and is by reason thereof adjudicated a public offender, or violates the conditions of probation, and the court finds at the hearing that the failure or neglect of such parent to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority or to faithfully discharge the conditions of probation of such child on the part of such parent, is the proximate cause of the act of the child upon which such second finding is based, or upon which such child is found to have violated the conditions of his probation, the court may declare all or a part of the recognizance forfeited and the amount of such forfeited recognizance shall be applied in payment of any damages which may have been caused by such child, if there be such damages, otherwise, the proceeds therefrom, or part remaining after the payment of damages as aforesaid, shall be retained by the court to apply to any future damages resulting from the act or acts of said child before he reaches his eighteenth birthday, at which date the remaining proceeds shall be returned to the parent or guardian.

    Analysis that requires compliance with the provisions of KRS 610.200 as an important variable in determining whether a juvenile’s confession was given voluntarily should also apply to violations of KRS 610.220. Shepherd v. Commonwealth, 251 S.W.3d 309, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 30 (Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Technical violation of KRS 610.200, which requires a police officer who takes a child into custody to notify the child’s parents, did not automatically make a 16-year old defendant’s statement inadmissible where there was every indication that his confession was given voluntarily and he did not raise the issue of voluntariness at trial. Shepherd v. Commonwealth, 251 S.W.3d 309, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 30 (Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Even though a detective failed to immediately notify the juvenile defendant’s mother of her son’s arrest and charges in violation of KRS 610.200(1), the fact remained that the police had made efforts to contact her and keep her apprised of the situation, and prior to defendant’s arrest, his mother already knew that defendant was a suspect in the murder, that his brother had been arrested and taken into custody, and that the police were in pursuit of defendant; thus, there was no basis to suppress defendant’s statements based upon a failure to notify his mother. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 276 S.W.3d 800, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 865, 130 S. Ct. 175, 175 L. Ed. 2d 110, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 5366 (U.S. 2009).
   </p>

    As there was no evidence of police coercion or of defendant’s unwillingness to cooperate, there was no reason to suppress his confession based upon a technical violation of KRS 610.200. Taylor v.

     Unpublished decision:
    </i>
    Where the inmate was a juvenile when he committed a murder and the police technically violated KRS 610.200 when they failed to contact the inmate’s mother but then advised the inmate of his Miranda rights and began questioning him, the admission of the inmate’s police statement did not violate his due process rights because: (1) the police did everything in their power to comply with the statute, (2) the inmate was not harmed by any errors the police may have made, and (3) there was no indication that the inmate’s statement was involuntary. The district court’s denial of the inmate’s 28 U.S.C.S. § 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed. Mayberry v. Motley, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 638 (6th Cir. Ky. Jan. 12, 2005).

    A system of selective placement of juveniles in the county jail for dispositional and predispositional purposes, although for limited periods of time, constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it was treating, for punitive purposes, the juveniles as adults and yet not according them, for due process purposes, the rights accorded to adults. (Decided under prior law) Baker v. Hamilton, 345 F. Supp. 345, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14032 (W.D. Ky. 1972).

    Trial courts should treat a violation of KRS 610.220 as an important factor in the overall determination of whether a juvenile defendant gave his statement voluntarily. Shepherd v. Commonwealth, 251 S.W.3d 309, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 30 (Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Sixteen-year old defendant’s claim that his police interview was coercive as a matter of law because he was held in custody longer than the statutory limit set forth in KRS 610.220(2) failed because defendant properly understood his
    <i>
     Miranda
    </i>
    rights, was not under the influence of any substance that would impair his judgment, and was not physically abused or coerced by the police; a possible technical violation of KRS 610.220(2) did not necessarily require the suppression of an otherwise voluntary statement. Shepherd v. Commonwealth, 251 S.W.3d 309, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 30 (Ky. 2008).

    Analysis that requires compliance with the provisions of KRS 610.200 as an important variable in determining whether a juvenile’s confession was given voluntarily should also apply to violations of KRS 610.220. Shepherd v. Commonwealth, 251 S.W.3d 309, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 30 (Ky. 2008).

   <p class="p9">
    As the police complied with KRS 610.220(2) in acquiring the necessary extensions to hold defendant in custody beyond the two-hour limit, the defendant answered the detective’s questions voluntarily, and there was no evidence of coercion, there were no grounds to suppress defendant’s taped statements. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 276 S.W.3d 800, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 865, 130 S. Ct. 175, 175 L. Ed. 2d 110, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 5366 (U.S. 2009).

    (7/15/2008). 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 87, sec. 5 amended KRS 610.265. This amendment inserted the following phrase at the beginning of subsection (4) of this section: “If, at the hearing conducted under subsection (3) paragraph (c) of this section, ...”. It appears that this reference is not correct. Subsection (3)(c) of this section does not mention hearings. It appears that the reference should have been to subsection (2) of KRS 610.265, which does deal with hearings. The Reviser of Statutes has made this change under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(e).

    A system of selective placement of juveniles in the county jail for dispositional and predispositional purposes, although for limited periods of time, constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it was treating, for punitive purposes, the juveniles as adults and yet not according them, for due process purposes, the rights accorded to adults.

    Subject to the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, juvenile court records of adjudications of guilt of a child for an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult shall be admissible in court at any time the child is tried as an adult, or after the child becomes an adult, at any subsequent criminal trial relating to that same person. Juvenile court records made available pursuant to this section may be used for impeachment purposes during a criminal trial, and may be used during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial. However, the fact that a juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent of an offense which would be a felony if the child had been an adult shall not be used in finding the child to be a persistent felony offender based upon that adjudication.

    The Kentucky State Police improperly relied on subsection (3) of this section, KRS 61.878(1)(a) and (k), and 620.050(4), in denying a request to inspect the files generated in the course of its investigation into a candidate for county sheriff who was charged with sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful transaction with a minor. Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case.

   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    The purpose of the shroud of secrecy and confidentiality mandated by this section and KRS 610.070 is to protect the juvenile, and clearly this purpose was uppermost in the minds of the General Assembly; it was intended that trials of juveniles not be publicized in the news media, as such publicity would possibly deprive the juvenile of a fair trial and, more particularly, would likely diminish his or her prospect for rehabilitation. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 48 (Ky. 1989).

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    Although KRS 600.020(12) provides that the Unified Juvenile Code applies to matters conducted in the juvenile session of District Court, in light of KRS 610.070(3), this section, and Const., § 115, the public and press are to be excluded not only from all juvenile proceedings at the District Court level, but from all appellate proceedings stemming therefrom. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 48 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    To exclude the press at the district level, but admit them at the appellate level would tend to nullify the original intent and purpose of the Legislature and the wholesome policy of the Uniform Juvenile Act. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 48 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Confidentiality of juvenile court records under the Kentucky Uniform Juvenile Code, KRS 610.340 did not violate a press association’s First Amendment right of access to the courts because (1) the right of access was not extended to juvenile proceedings, and (2) the presumption of openness did not apply to juvenile proceedings as they were historically closed to the public and public access to such proceedings would frustrate the purpose of the juvenile courts. Ky. Press Ass'n v. State, 355 F. Supp. 2d 853, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2514 (E.D. Ky. 2005).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to allow a juvenile expert from his attorney’s office to review the juvenile court records of several of the victims because defendant provided no evidence that the dispositional information would be exculpatory, but merely only made vague references that what transpired in the juvenile cases would be part of his defense and would be exculpatory.

    A juvenile court’s orders appointing attorneys as specific juveniles’ guardians ad litem and orders authorizing their payment in specific cases are confidential juvenile court records and as such are excluded from public view, however, a public agency’s records that a specific attorney was paid a sum certain out of public funds for his or her service in a specific court as a guardian ad litem are not; if the agency’s records include the names of the juveniles involved, making release of such information an invasion of the juveniles’ privacy, those names may be removed from the records before allowing access to the records. OAG 90-62.

   <p class="p9">
    Cabinet records of a disbursement to an individual for discharging the duty of guardian ad litem in juvenile court are not juvenile court records as envisioned by subsection (a) (now (1)) of this section; rather, they are public records of a public expenditure made by a public agency to a person in consideration of a public service which was performed under the auspices of the juvenile court.

    A transcript of grand jury testimony is a record subject to the exclusive control of the judiciary. Therefore, a person seeking the release of grand jury testimony involving reference to juvenile covered by KRS 610.320 or this section must do so by motion to the court with control over the record.

    The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. sec. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

    In addition to the purposes set forth in KRS 600.010, this chapter shall be interpreted to effectuate the following express legislative purposes regarding the treatment of dependent, neglected and abused children. Children have certain fundamental rights which must be protected and preserved, including but not limited to, the rights to adequate food, clothing and shelter; the right to be free from physical, sexual or emotional injury or exploitation; the right to develop physically, mentally, and emotionally to their potential; and the right to educational instruction and the right to a secure, stable family. It is further recognized that upon some occasions, in order to protect and preserve the rights and needs of children, it is necessary to remove a child from his or her parents.

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS 600.020 was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS 620.100, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice.

   <p class="p9">
    There was no error in the judgment regarding reasonable efforts for the mother, for purposes of KRS 625.090(3), 620.020(11), given that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services offered the mother many services, but she ultimately stopped attending parenting classes, participating in drug tests and abstaining from drug and alcohol use, completing various assessments, and making planned visits with the child; there was substantial evidence that the Cabinet offered services to the mother and she failed to avail herself of those services.

    Pursuant to KRS 610.127(7), reasonable efforts are not required as defined in KRS 620.020 when the court determines with respect to a parent that the parent has created circumstances that make continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify the family inconsistent with the best interests of the child and with the permanency plan for the child. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

    Trial court found that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents with the child, and considering the neglect and parents’
    lack of insight and lack of progress on their case plans, the trial court properly found that termination was in the child’s best interests. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

    Father asked that reasonable efforts to reunite him with the child be stopped, the trial court granted this request under KRS 610.127, and thereafter, the father did not try to work with the Cabinet of Health and Family Services again; he admitted to smoking marijuana and said he would continue doing so, he threatened staff members of the Cabinet, he refused to participate in any case plan, the Cabinet does not have the power to compel someone to accept reasonable efforts, and substantial evidence existed to support the finding that reasonable efforts were made but the father refused them. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

    In a termination of parental rights case, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) made reasonable efforts to reunite the family because CHFS referred the father to an abusive parenting program recognized by Kentucky; the father failed to complete the abusive parenting class as he refused to admit abusing his daughter; although the father lived in Michigan, CHFS was not required to become familiar with services offered around the world in the event a parent chose to relocate to another state or country; no matter where the father moved, a qualifying program would require the same admission; and he did not take advantage of services offered and did not sufficiently progress toward completion of the treatment plan.

    The family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody to the child’s grandmother and aunt. The grandmother and aunt were already the child’s physical custodians after findings of abuse and neglect had caused removal of the child from the home, so they were de facto custodians and were on equal footing with the father; therefore, the best interest standards under KRS 403.270(2) and KRS 620.023 were the proper guidelines and were properly applied to grant the grandmother and aunt permanent custody.

Since the permanency order in question in this case was not a “custody decree” within the meaning of KRS Chapter 403, KRS 403.340 is inapplicable, and the Family Court was required to consider the petition for custody as if there had been no prior custody determination.

    Parental grandparents met the requirement for de facto custodians under KRS 403.270 because a grandson had resided with the grandparents for more than 6 months, and intended compliance with a permanency plan with a goal of returning the grandson to his mother did not equate to a legal proceeding under KRS
    403.270; the mother had taken no legal action to regain custody of the grandson since his initial removal, and she had not complied with the permanency plan. Notwithstanding the mother’s argument, the grandparents had standing under KRS 620.027 because they provided a stable environment for the grandson; the grandson’s mental health issues were due to his diagnosis, not due to a problem with the grandparents.

   <p class="p9">
    In cases involving alleged abuse of children, and where there is reason to believe such abuse has occurred, a trial court must take an active role in assuring that the child’s physical and emotional wellbeing have been protected and is required, under this section, to report suspected abuse or neglect where the proper authorities or investigating agency have not been notified.

   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    Where a hospital employee allegedly made a false report to authorities that a newborn child’s meconium stool sample tested positive for drugs, which led to the child’s being placed in foster care, a doctor was immune from civil liability for the report under KRS 620.030(1) and KRS 620.050(1), because there was no allegation that she acted in bad faith. Garrison v. Leahy-Auer, 220 S.W.3d 693, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 151 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    To find that KRS 620.030 does not apply, there must be a finding that the act committed upon the child is not an act of sexual abuse. For purposes of KRS Chapter 600, the definition of a neglected or abused child is set forth at KRS 600.020. If sexual abuse has occurred, then the mandatory reporting requirement in KRS 620.030 would have required the teacher to report this incident and such mandatory reporting would result in this being considered a ministerial rather than a discretionary act which would preclude the teacher from claiming qualified official immunity. Nelson v. Turner, 256 S.W.3d 37, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 177 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err in granting a neighbor’s motion to dismiss an action filed by a mother and father alleging that their child was removed from their home based on a false report because the neighbor was entitled to immunity under KRS 620.030(1) when the mother and father failed to demonstrate that the neighbor acted in bad faith in reporting suspected child neglect; the neighbor reported the suspected neglect to her local law enforcement agency, and it did not matter that the police officer she spoke with was her son because he was a member of her local law enforcement agency. Morgan v. Bird, 289 S.W.3d 222, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Reporter may be acting under KRS
    620.030 to 620.050 in good faith if the reporter subjectively believed he or she was discharging the duty imposed by KRS 620.030; therefore, a reporter’s good faith belief that he or she is discharging the lawful duty to report under KRS 620.030, even if such a belief is ultimately determined to be erroneous, is all that is required under KRS 620.050(1). As a result, several health care providers were immune from liability under KRS 620.050(1) because they acted in good faith under KRS 620.030 in making a report of a new mother’s suspected child abuse, even though a blood alcohol report was erroneous. Norton Hosps., Inc. v. Peyton, 381 S.W.3d 286, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 165 (Ky. 2012).

    School officials were entitled to qualified immunity as to the student’s claims regarding their failure to report the teacher after becoming aware of his texting relationship with another student because this section’s reporting requirement involved a discretionary action when a school official was determining whether there was reasonable cause to believe that a child had been or was being abused.

    Because parents could not show doctor had bad intent when, after performing a series of tests on their baby including a CT scan showing a subarachnoid hemorrhage he noted was consistent with “Shaken Baby Syndrome,” he reported the baby’s injury to social services, the doctor was afforded the immunity granted by KRS 620.050; because doctor could not be held liable, neither could hospital.

    In a report of child neglect to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services' Department of Community Based Services based on a four-year-old student wandering away from a school, who was found approximately one-half mile away, the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant's claims against her employer alleging wrongful discharge, negligence and vicarious liability, and defamation as the record did not support any allegations that the employer's report of neglect was done in bad faith as appellant did not dispute that the child wandered away from the school while she was working; and, although appellant was ultimately exonerated from having committed neglect, an erroneous belief regarding neglect did not constitute bad faith.

    Under former KRS 199.335, diocese had duty to take action when it discovered that a teacher in its employ was sexually abusing students; failure to do so was a violation of the aforementioned section, and constituted concealment and obstruction under KRS 413.090, so as to toll the applicable statute of limitations for an action based on negligence on the part of the Diocese.

    Trial court did not err in granting a police officer summary judgment in an action filed by a mother and father alleging that their child was removed from their home based on a false report because the officer properly followed the guidelines outlined in KRS 620.030 for reporting a claim of neglect to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services; in light of finding no bad faith by the officer, it followed that the claims against a city and its council members based on failure to properly supervise and/or train the officer were also properly dismissed. Morgan v. Bird, 289 S.W.3d 222, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

    Under the plain language of KRS 600.020(1), the definition of an abused child is limited to a scenario in which his or her parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision inflicted or committed abuse, allowed abuse to be inflicted or committed, or created or allowed to be created a risk of abuse. As a result, the mandatory reporting requirement of KRS 620.030(1) does not apply when a child inappropriately touches another child unless a parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision allows such inappropriate touching to be committed or creates or allows such a risk of abuse.

    Although subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section provides that agencies providing services to children, such as schools, must cooperate with the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) and provide assistance and information, such interviews should be conducted in a manner that causes the least disruption to the students’ school schedule and the procedures vary if the allegations of student abuse are against school personnel. OAG 92-138.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    If the police desire to talk with a student who is a victim of a crime, then the school authorities should use their best judgment in determining whether the parents should be contacted. In the event that the officer is investigating allegations of dependency, neglect or abuse, the school should allow the interview to occur at school. The school should consult with the officer before the school officials inform the parents that an interview has taken place. OAG 92-138.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    School officials should use their discretion and confer with the police officer in deciding whether to be present when the court designated worker or the police questions a student. If the child is a victim of abuse, then the child should have input on choosing a trusted adult to sit in during the interview. OAG 92-138.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since the school is not required to notify the parents before the Cabinet for Human Resources talks with the students, the fact that the parents cannot be reached is immaterial. OAG 92-138.

    The school system is required pursuant to this section to permit social workers from the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to come into the school and talk with students regarding investigations of dependency, neglect or abuse. OAG 92-138.

   <p class="p9">
    Whether school personnel should be present when the social workers question the students is a decision that is best left to the discretion of the Cabinet for Human Resources’ social worker conducting the interview. OAG 92-138.

    A child who does not receive necessary medical care due to his parents’ religious belief may be considered an abused or neglected child; accordingly, the reporting requirements of subsection (1) of this section and the investigation requirements of KRS 620.050(3) are mandatory and must be followed in cases involving the religious exemption contained in KRS 600.020(1).

    When a district court ordered the Department for Community Based Services of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services—which investigated and found no substantiation for a parent’s claims that the other abused their child—to open a case and further assess the family needs, it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The district court usurped the Cabinet’s authority to the benefit of the complaining parent who presented nothing in the case except two unsworn petitions in two different emergency protective order cases.

    Reporter may be acting under KRS
    620.030 to 620.050 in good faith if the reporter subjectively believed he or she was discharging the duty imposed by KRS 620.030; therefore, a reporter’s good faith belief that he or she is discharging the lawful duty to report under KRS 620.030, even if such a belief is ultimately determined to be erroneous, is all that is required under KRS 620.050(1). As a result, several health care providers were immune from liability under KRS 620.050(1) because they acted in good faith under KRS 620.030 in making a report of a new mother’s suspected child abuse, even though a blood alcohol report was erroneous.

    This section requires schools to continue to allow the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to interview children on school premises without consent of parents in the course of an abuse investigation if that is the course of action determined appropriate by the CHR. OAG 87-33.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Department for Social Services acted properly when it refused to make available for inspection to the alleged perpetrator of child abuse the names of informants and those portions of the statements of a judge and an informant wherein those parties set forth personal opinions, observations, and recommendations not related to the child abuse investigation and the findings resulting from that investigation. OAG 87-82.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The public agency’s refusal to furnish records and documents to the requesting party relative to an investigation of an alleged instance of child abuse and neglect was supported by subdivision (1)(j) of KRS 61.878 and subsection (4) of this section. OAG 88-4.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Cabinet for Human Resources acted consistently with the Open Records Laws to the extent that it withheld from inspection the names of informants which spawned its investigation pursuant to KRS 61.878(1)(a) and (j) and subdivision (4)(a) of this section, and to the extent that it denied inspection of the verbal complaint or oral allegations made by an individual to an employee of the cabinet. However, the cabinet acted inconsistently with the Open Records Law to the extent that it denied inspection of the written complaint which initially spawned the investigation, although, the names of informants contained within the written complaint may properly be withheld. OAG 91-33.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Where person requesting documents regarding detention of student at a school and the report and findings of an investigation conducted by the Department for Social Services did not demonstrate that he fell under any of the statutorily recognized classifications of this section or KRS 61.878 or that his particular situation warranted the release of the requested material, his request was properly denied. OAG 91-93.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Subsection (4) is applicable to information obtained as a result of a joint investigation by the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Kentucky State Police. OAG 91-173.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    This section clearly requires that the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Department for Social Services withhold from all persons information acquired as a result of an investigation conducted pursuant to this section, unless the requesting party can demonstrate that he or she satisfies one of the requirements set forth in subsection (4)(a) through (4)(f) of this section. Thus where, although the requesting party was currently involved in a custody dispute with his former wife, she was the custodial parent, and the allegations of abuse were not substantiated, the requesting party could not be said to have satisfied the requirements of subsection (4)(e) of this section and his open records request was properly denied. OAG 92-53.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Subsection (4) of this section KRS 61.878(1)(k) and KRS 610.320(3) are aimed at protecting juveniles, and not adults who are criminally prosecuted for victimizing juveniles. OAG 93-ORD-42.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Kentucky State Police improperly relied on subsection (4) of this section, KRS 61.878(1)(a) and (k), and KRS 610.320(3) in denying a request to inspect the files generated in the course of its investigation into a candidate for county sheriff who was charged with sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful transaction with a minor. Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case. OAG 93-ORD-42.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Unless the Kentucky State Police is acting as the Cabinet for Human Resources’ designated representative in conducting a joint investigation into allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, as opposed to independently conducting an investigation into possible criminal charges against an adult, subsection (4) of this section does not operate to authorize nondisclosure of the records it compiles. OAG 93-ORD-42.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Department of Social Services improperly denied the Kentucky Board of Nursing’s request for medical records referenced in a report prepared by the Department in the course of an investigation into suspected child abuse pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, which is incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of subdivision (1)(k) of KRS 61.878. OAG 93-ORD-132.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A child who does not receive necessary medical care due to his parents’ religious belief may considered an abused or neglected child; accordingly, the reporting requirements of KRS 620.030 (1) and the investigation requirements of subsection (3) of this section are mandatory and must be followed in cases involving the religious exemption contained in KRS 600.020 (1). OAG 93-84.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since the shroud of secrecy mandated by KRS 620.050(4) is “not intended to protect the identities of adults and employees of a public agency charged with violations of the criminal laws,” but is instead intended to protect the affected families, and in particular, the affected children, the Cabinet for Human Resources could not persuasively argue that it was bound by the confidentiality provision found at KRS 620.050(4) in witholding unsubstantiated complaints of abuse against its employees, and, at the same time, that it was free to release most, if not all, of the remaining records it compiled in its investigation of alleged employee misconduct. OAG 94-ORD-76 (overruling OAG 88-4 where inconsistent).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Cabinet for Health Service properly relied on KRS 61.872(6) and 61.878(1)(a), (k) and (l) and various confidentiality provisions found in both state (KRS 209.140, 210.235, 214.420, 214.625 and 620.050) and federal law, in denying request for inspection of all nursing facility licensure inspection reports for a two year period where the Cabinet sustained the burden of showing that such request was an unreasonable burden on the Cabinet in describing with specificity the actual volumes of records implicated by the request and where the exemptions to disclosure provided by the state and federal law were mandatory and the difficulty of separation of confidential from releasable information constituted an unreasonable burden. 97-ORD-88.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Cabinet for Families and Children properly relied on KRS 61.878(1)(a), in addition to KRS 194B.060 and subsection (4) of this section, which are incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS 61.878(1)(l), in denying a request for a copy of the Children’s Protective Services Report relating to two (2) children identified in the request and their mother. OAG 99-ORD-197.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Although the requester has established that she has “relative placement” of at least one of her grandchildren, she has not established that she is the children’s custodial parent or legal guardian within the meaning of KRS 620.050(5)(b) or that she otherwise falls within one of the remaining statutorily recognized classifications. A letter prepared by a social worker does not invest her with the status of custodial parent or legal guardian. Nor has she produced a court order directing disclosure of the disputed records to her. Insofar as none of the criteria found in KRS 620.050(5) are satisfied, the requester is not entitled to receive a copy of those records pursuant to KRS 61.878(1)(l). OAG 03-ORD-70.

    (7/15/2016). 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 107, sec. 3 directed that a new section of KRS Chapter 403 be created for the text of this statute. The subject matter of KRS Chapter 403 relates to divorce and dissolution of marriage. Since this statute addresses an option for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to follow at the conclusion of a child protection investigation that does not result in removing a child from the parent or legal guardian's home, in codification the Reviser of Statutes created a new section of KRS Chapter 620, which addresses child abuse and neglect investigations, as a more appropriate statutory designation under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a).

    Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS 600.020 was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS 620.100, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice.

   <p class="p9">
    Circuit court properly denied a father's petition for immediate entitlement to custody of his eight-year-old child, which followed a removal hearing after a fire claimed the lives of her mother and her brothers because the child's best interests were served by her maternal grandmother retaining custody where the father, who lived in South Carolina, admitted he had not seen the child in person in over two years, the child was close to the grandmother, was well-adapted and familiar with her school and other surroundings, the circuit court intended to ease the child into her new reality, and the legal balance between the father's rights and the protection of the child had to be struck in favor of the child.

   <p class="p9">
    Trial court erred in its restricted application of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 620.110 where it misconstrued case law focused exclusively on parents to mean that only parents could invoke § 620.110 to seek relief from a temporary removal order. Notwithstanding that error, consideration of the appeal was severely hampered given the lack of a clear statement of preservation, as required by Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.12(4)(c)(v), there was no recording of the § 620.110 hearing, and the record had been certified without an avowal. The great aunt and uncle had not shown that they were aggrieved where the only connection the they alleged with the child was a blood connection, and that bare allegation, without proof of an actual connection between the child and the great aunt and uncle, was not enough to trigger relief.

    In any proceeding under this chapter, when the court is petitioned to remove or continue the removal of a child from the custody of his parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision, the court shall first consider whether the child may be reasonably protected against the alleged dependency, neglect or abuse, by alternatives less restrictive than removal. Such alternatives may include, but shall not be limited to, the provision of medical, educational, psychiatric, psychological, social work, counseling, day care, or homemaking services with monitoring wherever necessary by the cabinet or other appropriate agency. Where the court specifically finds that such alternatives are adequate to reasonably protect the child against the alleged dependency, neglect or abuse, the court shall not order the removal or continued removal of the child.

The cabinet shall develop a treatment plan for each child designed to meet the needs of the child. The cabinet may change the child’s placement or treatment plan as the cabinet may require. The cabinet shall notify the committing court of the change, in writing, within fourteen (14) days after the change has been implemented.

     Voluntary commitments.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    The cabinet may accept custody of a child who is voluntarily committed to the cabinet by the child’s parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody. However, the cabinet shall refuse to accept any child on a voluntary commitment unless adequate facilities, funds, and resources are available to care for the child, and the secretary finds that commitment would be in the best interest of the child.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    As a condition of any voluntary commitment, the cabinet may enter into an agreement with the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the child consenting to the commitment to pay an agreed sum for the care and treatment of the child. The sum shall be determined by the needs of the child and by the ability of the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody or other person exercising custodial control or to pay.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    In the case of voluntary commitment, the cabinet may expend funds necessary to give the child all services available to any committed child including, but not limited to, diagnosis, treatment, foster care, day care, care and treatment in a facility, and necessary medical, psychological, and psychiatric care.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    Any person who has consented to a child’s voluntary commitment may request the release of the child in writing addressed to the cabinet. The cabinet shall within ten (10) days release the child, or, if in the opinion of the cabinet it would be in the best interest of the child to remain in the custody of the cabinet, a petition shall be filed in the court of the county of residence of the child as provided in KRS 620.030 to 620.050.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    If, following a hearing on the matter, the court determines that the child can no longer benefit from those services offered by the cabinet or that the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the child is capable of providing proper care, the child may be returned at once to the care of his parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the child or to another person mutually agreed upon.
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    Any parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of a child who has consented to the child’s voluntary commitment to the cabinet shall be entitled to participate in treatment planning for the child for the pendency of the commitment.

    Termination of a mother’s and a father’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was in their children’s best interests because there was ongoing domestic violence between the mother and the father and the parents and the children, the parents did little to resolve their drug and alcohol dependency, the parents continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or were incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents’
    conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, one child was sexually abused by her parents and her uncles, another child was deemed a high suicide risk, and the parents failed to make sufficient progress toward identified goals as set forth in the court-approved case plan which would have allowed for the children’s safe return.

    A parent who has transferred possession and custody of his or her child to another has surrendered the primary right of custody and thereafter the court shall determine custody on the basis of the best interest of the child.

    The fact that the mother, who voluntarily, over a period of months, arranged to give up child for adoption, had understandable “reasons” to give up her child and “cause” to wish to regain her child did not obviate the burden on her to show that to return custody to her would be for the child’s best interest; the mother must bear this burden even in the absence of proof that she is unfit in the context of the standard established by the involuntary termination statute (abandonment, neglect or abuse).

    Where mother’s petition to terminate parental rights was initially voluntary, but the mother later attempted to revoke her consent, the court had a responsibility to consider the overall welfare of the child in deciding whether or not to permit such revocation; “sufficient reason” to revoke means more than emotional distress at the time the petition for voluntary termination is filed.

    Although the petitions for termination of parental rights were written in a bare bones manner and the allegations were couched in conclusory language, substantial justice was done in that the pleadings gave fair notice of what was taking place; therefore, procedural due process was not lacking. (Decided under prior law) V.S. v. Commonwealth, Cabinet for Human Resources, 706 S.W.2d 420, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1069 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).

    Placement with relatives may be an option for consideration by the Cabinet for Human Resources but nothing more; once this section has been complied with and a review of the Cabinet’s program for the children is determined to be reasonable, then there can be no valid argument for want of due process in this regard.

    There is no requirement in KRS 625.050(4)(a) that a petition for termination of parental rights contain the precise home address a child involved in an involuntary termination proceeding. The petition filed against the mother containing the mailing address of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Cabinet for Health and Family Services and clearly stating that the child resided in a state approved home met the requirements of KRS 625.050(4)(a).

    Trial court incorrectly applied Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 625 to a step-mother’s amended petition because it was an adoption, and therefore, Ky. Rev. Stat.

    By its nature, adoption under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 199 vitiates parental rights of biological parents. Ky. Rev. Stat.

    Where the State petitioned to involuntarily terminate parental rights, where the parents thereafter petitioned to voluntarily terminate their parental rights upon the condition that the child’s paternal grandparents be permitted to adopt him, and where the paternal grandparents moved to intervene, the trial court properly denied their motion because a proceeding for the termination of parental rights concerned the relationship between parent and child and not any other party; the grandparents simply had no cognizable rights to protect or enforce in a termination proceeding.

When the cabinet is not the proposed custodian, the court may order the cost to be paid by the proposed adoptive parent, parents, agency, or the petitioner. Upon motion of any party, the child may be permitted to be present during the proceedings and to testify if the court finds such to be in the best interests of the child. In its discretion, the Circuit Court may interview the child in private, but a record of the interview shall be made, which, in the discretion of the court, may be sealed to be used only by an appellate court;

If the Circuit Court so finds, the Circuit Court shall inform the parent; and, upon request, if it appears reasonably necessary in the interest of justice, the Circuit Court shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent pursuant to KRS Chapter 31 to be provided or paid for by the Finance and Administration Cabinet a fee to be set by the court and not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500);

   </h4>
   <p class="p9">
    Absence, voluntary or court-imposed, may be a factor to consider in determining whether the children have been neglected. (Decisions under prior law.) J.H. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 704 S.W.2d 661, 1985 Ky. App. LEXIS 719 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Where for reasons other than poverty alone, the incarcerated father continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or was incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement, and where the incarcerated parent never contributed to the economic well-being of the family when with them, the trial court was correct in involuntarily terminating his parental rights. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1995).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The statute requires a finding (1) that the child, by clear and convincing evidence, is an abused or neglected child; (2) that the termination would be in the best interest of the child; and (3) that one or more of the factors set out in subsection (1)(a)-(f) (now (2)(a)-(c), (e) and (f)) of this section are present. R. C. R. v. Commonwealth, 988 S.W.2d 36, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 138 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Evidence was sufficient to support termination of a mother’s parental rights where the mother had been incarcerated since the birth of the child at issue for reasons directly related to the abuse of an older child, social worker testified that parenting instructions provided did not carry over from one (1) visit to another, and a psychological associate testified that the mother’s history in prison included two (2) suicide attempts and self-mutilation. M.P.S. v. Cabinet for Human Resources ex rel. S.A.S., 979 S.W.2d 114, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 66 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Before a circuit court may terminate a parent’s rights, it must find, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that the child is an abused or neglected child, as defined by KRS 600.020(1); and (2) that termination would be in the child’s best interest. After that threshold is met, a court must find the existence of one of the numerous grounds recited in KRS 625.090(1), including abandonment, infliction of serious physical injury or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or neglect in providing access to basic survival needs, in order to terminate parental rights. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Family court properly terminated the parental rights of a minor mother under KRS 625.090 without receiving expert testimony as to the mother’s parenting potential upon adulthood because § 625.090(2)(e), (g) did not require proof that a minor parent would be unable to effectively parent a child when the parent reached the age of majority. Commonwealth v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. 2010).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the child’s best interests would be served if the mother’s rights were terminated, given the evidence that (1) the mother did not have stable housing and was dependent on her boyfriend, (2) she did not pay any child support, (3) the child had special needs based on his drug addiction at birth, and (4) the child was in a foster home, and the child recognized the providers as his parents. D.J.D. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 350 S.W.3d 833, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 259 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Regarding abandonment, neither parent saw the child for more than one year, neither parent worked on his or her case plan, both had child support arrearages, and there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court’s decision to terminate the parents’
    rights, and this was not clearly erroneous. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court found that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents with the child, and considering the neglect and parents’
    lack of insight and lack of progress on their case plans, the trial court properly found that termination was in the child’s best interests. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err by finding that at least on ground listed in KRS 625.090(2) existed because: (1) at the time of the termination of parental rights hearing the children had been in the custody and control of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services for over 24 months and for a period of not less than six months, and for reasons other than poverty alone; (2) the parents failed to provide essential parental care and protection for the children, including clothing, shelter, medical care, or education; (3) the parents had not had any contact with their children since September 2010; and (4) the parents did not complete all required substance abuse orders and recommendations, individual counseling services, or parenting classes. C.A.W. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 391 S.W.3d 400, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 24 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of parental rights was proper because the court found that the State had provided all reasonable services; there was ample testimony that both the mother and the children had been offered a number of services throughout the time the children were in foster care and that the services were fully utilized. C.H. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 399 S.W.3d 782, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 116 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    It appeared that the trial court relied only on the mother’s incarceration as a ground for termination, but that was just one factor to be considered. M.L.C. v. Cabinet, 411 S.W.3d 761, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 136 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because a child was found to be abused and neglected based on the infliction of an emotional injury; the child suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the mother's mental illness made it incapable for her to care for the child. Moreover, the mother inflicted emotional injury to the child, failed to provide adequate parental care and supervision, and failed to provide the essentials of life for the child's overall well-being; termination was in the best interest of the child, reunification efforts were made, and the child's welfare would have improved if termination was ordered. B.E.K. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 487 S.W.3d 457, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 40 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Family court did not err in determining that the grounds in this section were present after a witness testified that in his professional opinion the mother’s disability was such that she was unlikely to improve to a degree that would permit her to give adequate care to the child and there were no services that would abate the concerns if the child were returned to the mother. Commonwealth v. K.S., 585 S.W.3d 202, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 382 (Ky. 2019).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the child was neglected as she was born with amphetamines in her system that came from the mother’s use of amphetamines prescribed to her, but she did not inform her physician of her pregnancy; she continuously abused drugs over the two-year period after the child had been removed; she went from one abusive relationship to another and did not complete her protective parenting class; and she did not pay child support; because there was no reasonable expectation of improvement in the mother’s situation within a reasonable amount of time; and because the child had been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months preceding the filing of the petition to terminate. T.R.W. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 223 (Ky. Ct. App. May 10, 2019).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err when it admitted into evidence the files from the dependency, neglect, and abuse proceedings of the child and her three siblings because the trial court made independent findings regarding the child’s neglect based on the testimonial evidence produced at trial and did not simply rely on the dependency, neglect, and abuse adjudications; the abuse or neglect of other children in the family was relevant to the current termination proceedings; and the documents were admissible because they were not excluded by hearsay, and were self-authenticating public documents. T.R.W. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 223 (Ky. Ct. App. May 10, 2019).

    Evidence showing that the defendants’ children lived in a filthy home, suffered from malnutrition, sores and impetigo and were frequently absent from school supported a judgment terminating parental rights. (Decisions under prior law.) Church v. Department for Human Resources, 555 S.W.2d 602, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 791 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Although incarceration for an isolated criminal offense may not constitute abandonment justifying termination of parental rights, incarceration is a factor to be considered, particularly so where father was incarcerated for the rape of the half-sister of the two (2) children involved. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1995).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Although testimony consisting of children’s out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse would be improper in a criminal case, in a termination of parental rights action statements were properly admitted as additional evidence of parental conduct. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 134 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Although a foster parent does not qualify as an expert witness competent to testify as to the existence of sexual abuse, question posed to foster parent as to whether she believed that the children had been sexually abused was not objectionable nor unfairly prejudicial in bench trial terminating parental rights of mother. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 134 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court erred in failing to terminate a mother’s parental rights to her four children where, by clear and convincing evidence, the State demonstrated that the children were placed in foster care by the mother because she could not deal with their problems, she had no interaction with them for nearly a year and they were in foster care for over three years, the mother had exposed the children to sexual abuse and exploitation and refused to acknowledge the same, and she was unable and unwilling to care for their needs. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Order terminating a father’s parental rights was affirmed where, inter alia, father had no contact with the child for several years, and provided no financial support for 31 months; while the father claimed he did not know where to send support payments, the parties’ agreement included the proper address. B.T.R. v. J.W., 148 S.W.3d 294, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 290 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Evidence that the residences the parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 97 (Ky. 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS 625.090(1)(a)1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under subsection (1)(a)3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct. App. May 18, 2007), rev'd, 2008 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 150 (Ky. Aug. 21, 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Grant of petition for adoption without the consent of the biological father, who had undergone gender reassignment surgery, was, in effect, a proceeding to terminate the father’s parental rights based on abuse and neglect. The grant was proper because the evidence showed that the minor child suffered major depression, suicidal ideation, a decline in school performance, physical symptoms and withdrawn behavior, and the child testified the child felt abandoned. M.B. v. D.W., 236 S.W.3d 31, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 346 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of a mother’s parental rights was proper under KRS 625.090(2)(c) as the mother had abused her children or allowed them to be abused by a stepfather. J.M.R. v. Commonwealth, 239 S.W.3d 116, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 407 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007), overruled,
    Colvard v. Commonwealth, 309 S.W.3d 239, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 62 (Ky. 2010).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of a mother’s and a father’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was in their children’s best interests because there was ongoing domestic violence between the mother and the father and the parents and the children, the parents did little to resolve their drug and alcohol dependency, the parents continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or were incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents’
    conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, one child was sexually abused by her parents and her uncles, another child was deemed a high suicide risk, and the parents failed to make sufficient progress toward identified goals as set forth in the court-approved case plan which would have allowed for the children’s safe return. C.R.G. v. Cabinet for Health & Fam. Servs., 297 S.W.3d 914, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of parental rights was inappropriate pursuant to KRS 625.090(5) because the parents were loving, they had the potential to learn at least some appropriate parenting skills, and they had repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to learn and change their behavior at the request of Cabinet for Health and Family Services. D.G.R. v. Commonwealth, 364 S.W.3d 106, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 36 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    KRS 600.020(1)(a)(2) allowed a finding by a court of neglect or abuse where the risk of abuse existed, and in this termination case, the child tested positive for marijuana at birth and the parents admitted to using such before and during the pregnancy, such that there was sufficient evidence to remove the child from the home in order to ensure her safety. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err by determining that the children were abused and/or neglected under KRS 600.020, 625.090 because the parents admitted that their children were neglected as a result of their substance abuse issues and admitted that because of their lack of supervision of one child she was injured and sustained a bruise to her face.

    Whether abandonment occurs through incarceration sufficiently to support terminating parental rights must be strictly scrutinized; incarceration alone can never be construed as abandonment as a matter of law.

   <p class="p9">
    Trial court’s findings were insufficient to support its conclusions that mother abandoned or neglected her child, where mother’s separation from the child was the result of her mental and emotional problems, for which she had sought and continued to receive treatment, and her failure to provide support was due to her inability to work due to her mental problems.

    Where the children’s health was unquestionably harmed when they were allowed to be hungry and unclothed, to run around with infected wounds, and to have obvious serious physical conditions go undetected and untreated, the trial court had no choice but to find abuse and neglect exercised upon these children by their respective parents and the court did not terminate parental rights on the basis of poverty alone.

   <p class="p9">
    Termination of a father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment was inappropriate because, although the father did not visit with and support the child after the child was placed in foster care, the failures by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services denied the father an opportunity to maintain contact with the child and to work toward a court-approved case plan to regain custody. Furthermore, the oral parenting plan given to the father was so lacking in formality and detail that it did not constitute a plan.

   <p class="p9">
    Trial court did not err in finding that the father had abandoned the child for a period of 90 days where the father testified that he had not attempted to contact, support or visit the child since the child was placed in temporary custody, the father was not incarcerated for nearly three months of the temporary custody period, and the father failed to comply with court orders. M.P.R. v. Cabinet for Health & Family Servs., 520 S.W.3d 409, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 219 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper because he abandoned his children based on his total failure to provide child support, a birthday card, a Christmas toy, a meal, or even stroll with them around a park, and a few phone calls did not offset the father visiting with the children only twice in the span of a year; the father did not provide his children essential parental care and protection as he did not have regular contact with the children while in Kentucky, or buy them food, toys, or clothing; he did not provide essentials necessary for his children’s well-being; and there was no reasonable expectation of improvement or significant improvement in the immediately foreseeable future.

   <p class="p9">
    Clear and convincing evidence did not show a mother abandoned her children because (1) she left the children with an improper caregiver for under 90 days, (2) nothing showed she could contact the children from prison, (3) the Cabinet For Health and Family Services barred her contact, (4) her minor crimes were insufficient to terminate parental rights, and (5) she completed case plan parts she could while in prison, so no settled purpose to forego parental duties and relinquish parental claims was shown.

    No clear and convincing evidence supported termination of a mother’s parental rights under Ky. Rev. Stat.

    Even though a father's incarceration could have been considered, the fact and length of his incarceration, without more, could not have supported the finding of abandonment necessary for an involuntary termination of his parental rights under this statute. The father had a positive involvement with the child and the family prior to his incarceration; moreover, while in prison, he completed his General Equivalency Degree, he participated in educational and drug-treatment programs, and he maintained visitation with the child.

    The statutory reasons underlying the termination process relate to parental abandonment, neglect and abuse so substantial that the child must be legally cut off from the parent. They justify a legal structure that provides finality and blocks every path to further litigation to reestablish a connection to parents whose rights have been terminated. Litigation by grandparents, by the family of such parents, would frustrate and circumvent the termination decree. The statutory language of severance required in the termination decree now expresses no exception, and none may be created by implying an exception from the grandparents’ visitation statute. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).

    The overriding considerations expressed through the termination and adoption statutes for cutting, finally and irrevocably, all connections to the biological parent and his family where there has been a final order terminating parental rights and where there has been an adoption introducing the child into a new family, simply do not apply where there has been only a stepparent adoption with no prior legal severance of the bond to the grandparents.

    A mother had standing to appeal the trial court’s denial of her petition for involuntary termination of a father’s parental rights with respect to their child; KRS 625.110, which allows appeals only from an order granting such a petition, and not from a denial of a petition, is unconstitutional for violating the right to appeal guaranteed by Ky. Const. § 115. K.R.L. v. P.A.C., 210 S.W.3d 183, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 349 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

    Though petitions by childrens’
    custodians to adopt the children despite their biological mother’s withholding of consent necessitated an order of involuntary termination of parental rights, and though KRS 625.110 prohibited appeals from orders denying involuntary termination of parental right, that general prohibition was overcome by the specific statutory authority of KRS 199.560 that allowed appeals of orders denying adoption petitions. The court held that the custodians’
    appeals could proceed. C.M.C. v. A.L.W., 180 S.W.3d 485, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 246 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).

    Although the proposed ordinance is not in conflict with the legislative scheme, the mere fact that the legislature has enacted KRS 159.080 to 159.140 does not automatically preempt the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government from enacting local legislation which would allow the police to stop youths, who are off school property during school hours, and return to their schools those who do not have a legitimate excuse for their absence; however, such activity by the police would be in direct contravention with this section of the state juvenile code, thus would be deemed invalid.

    Noncompliance with pretrial procedures deprived the family court of subject matter jurisdiction, but the habitual runaway cases in which the child had been detained under an emergency protective order were an exception. Thus, noncompliance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 610.030(6) and 630.050 did not deprive the family court of subject matter jurisdiction because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 610.012 was more specific and, therefore, controlled. C.C. v. Mehling, 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 48 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2020).

In cases where the child is detained, the court-designated worker’s report shall be submitted within seventy-two (72) hours of the time the child is ordered detained.

If convicted in the Circuit Court, he shall be subject to the same penalties as an adult offender, except that until he reaches the age of eighteen (18) years, he shall be confined in a facility or program for juveniles or for youthful offenders, unless the provisions of KRS 635.025 apply or unless he is released pursuant to expiration of sentence or parole, and at age eighteen (18) he shall be returned to the sentencing Circuit Court for proceedings consistent with KRS 640.030(2).

    A 17-year-old juvenile convicted of first degree manslaughter, but mentally ill, qualifies as an adult offender under this section because he committed a felony with a firearm, so is subject to the same penalties as an adult pursuant to RCr 3.07. Thus, the protection KRS 640.040(3) offers youthful offenders against the limitation on probation set out in KRS 533.060(1) is withdrawn by this section. (Decided under prior law) Mullins v.

    Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus because the Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal; the district court's denial of the motion to transfer defendant juvenile to circuit court was an interlocutory order because further proceedings were necessary in district court to dispose of all the issues in the case.

    Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth a writ of mandamus after a district court denied its motion to transfer defendant juvenile because the Commonwealth demonstrated a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if the district court was proceeding erroneously and correction of the error was necessary and appropriate in the interest of orderly judicial administration; the mandatory findings under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 640.010(2)(a) can be the proper subject of a writ of mandamus. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 429 (Ky. Ct.

    Subsection (4) of this section, as amended in 1994 to require a child over the age of 14 being charged with a felony involving the use of a firearm be tried in Circuit Court as an adult defendant, does not violate Ky. Const., §§ 112 and 113, and the provisions of subsection (4) of this section can be harmonized with the provisions of KRS 640.010.

    KRS 635.020(4) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine by impermissibly taking prosecutorial decisions away from prosecutors once it is found that a firearm was used by a juvenile 14 years of age or older in the commission of a felony; KRS 635.020(4) vests jurisdiction in the circuit court over a particular class of offenders, which is a constitutional exercise of authority because of the legislature’s power under Ky. Const. § 113(6) to limit the jurisdiction of the district court. Bellfield v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 30 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 825 (Ky. Ct.

   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    When the juvenile does not directly use the firearm but is charged with a complicity offense, the record must reflect sufficient evidence to show probable cause that complicity has occurred. Since this review occurs at the charging stage rather than at a trial of guilt or innocence, this means that there must be allegations that, if true, would support a probable cause finding that the juvenile acted with the kind of culpability with respect to the result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense when she solicited or conspired with others, aided in planning or committing the offense, or failed to prevent the offense when legally required to do so. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    When the principal offense is a result offense, KRS 502.020(2) requires that, in order to be guilty of the crime by complicity, a defendant must act with the culpability required to obtain the result of the charged offense and cause that particular result as an element of the offense by soliciting or conspiring with another, aiding another in planning or committing the offense, or failing to make a proper effort to prevent the offense when there is a legal duty to do so. Use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury is the necessary element that separates first- and second-degree assault. However, to support first-degree assault by complicity, the proof in a youthful offender transfer hearing must further establish allegations that the accused was indeed complicit. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    KRS 635.020(4) provides that transfer is mandatory when a firearm is used in commission of the underlying offense; by treating offenses in which a firearm is used differently, the General Assembly has declared a different public policy, one of essentially no tolerance of gun-related crimes by juveniles, and in light of that policy, it would be unjust to allow a juvenile who has used a firearm to avoid prosecution as a youthful offender. If the district court errs in finding that the gun was not used by a juvenile, then it fails to comply with the mandate of KRS 635.020(4), which creates a risk that the administration of justice will suffer; in such a case, a writ of mandamus would be appropriate. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Application of KRS 635.020(4) to a juvenile charged with complicity to a felony must first focus on the strong language of this section, which mandates that a child charged with a felony in which a firearm, whether functional or not, was used in the commission of the offense, must be transferred to the circuit court for trial as an adult; while the statute includes some other qualifiers that are important, the language sets forth the legislative intent to place juveniles who are involved in gun crimes in a different position than other public offenders. This is sometimes referred to as an automatic transfer rule, but that is only true if all the statutory elements are met: there must be probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a felony, that a firearm was used in commission of that felony, and that the juvenile was 14 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony. KRS 635.020(4), and yet the seriousness with which the legislature regards the use of guns by juveniles is clearly presented. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    When a gun is used in the commission of a felony, the district court’s first inquiry must be whether that use was by the juvenile directly or whether the use can be attributed to the juvenile. When the juvenile is charged as a principal, that is, having directly committed the charged offense and used a gun in the process, this inquiry is relatively simple. For example, first-degree assault is the criminal offense in this case involving a firearm. The first-degree assault statute, KRS 508.010, requires that a defendant must intentionally cause serious physical injury by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    To be transferred under KRS 635.020(4), the child must at least be complicit in another person’s use of a firearm. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Transfer statute requires that, if a juvenile defendant is charged with a felony, the juvenile shall be transferred to circuit court if a firearm was used in the commission of the offense; all this requires is that there be a felony charge and that a firearm be used in commission of the felony. Further, there is no language in KRS 635.020(4) stating that the firearm must actually be used by the juvenile charged; rather, the statute only requires that the firearm be used in the commission of the felony the juvenile is charged with, not that the juvenile was the one who wielded the firearm. Because the transfer language in the statute is mandatory and because of the obvious policy the legislature has expressed with regard to juveniles using firearms in crimes, complicity to commit an offense involving use of a firearm requires transfer when an offense involving direct use of a firearm would. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    That a firearm offense committed by means of complicity can be the basis of transfer under KRS 635.020(4) does not mean that all such charged offenses must be transferred; the charge alone does not decide whether a transfer occurs. Pursuant to KRS 635.020(4), transfer only occurs for such charges if, following a preliminary hearing, the district court finds probable cause to believe that the child committed a felony, that a firearm was used in the commission of that felony, and that the child was fourteen years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).

   <p class="p9">
    Circuit court did not err by granting a petition for writ of mandamus directing the district court to transfer appellant juvenile’s robbery case to the circuit court, because the conditions of KRS 635.020(4) were satisfied. Appellant was older than 14 years of age and there was probable cause to believe that he was a participant in a crime in which a gun was used, because he was in the vehicle at the time of the robbery and had proceeds from the robbery on his person at the time of arrest.

    The juvenile court did not have the authority to sentence an eighteen (18) year-old defendant to confinement in a juvenile facility for a car theft committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday. Jefferson County Dep't for Human Services v. Carter, 795 S.W.2d 59, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1990).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Under subsection (5) of this section, a juvenile public offender may not be committed to a secure juvenile detention facility for more than 90 days, even if the offender is charged with multiple incidents of criminal behavior. Commonwealth v. W.E.B., 985 S.W.2d 344, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 170 (Ky. 1998).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Juvenile court was without authority to order the juveniles confined in adult detention facilities for public offenses which they committed before they reached the age of 18; since KRS 635.060(2), (3) expressly envisioned situations beyond the 18th birthday, it was clear that the only authorized dispositions for the juveniles were either placement on probation, home incarceration, or supervision for a period not to exceed 1 year, sentencing the juveniles to adult detention facilities was not within the parameters of the authorized dispositions. D.R.T. v. Commonwealth, 111 S.W.3d 392, 2002 Ky. App. LEXIS 2031 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    KRS 635.060(4) provided that a juvenile offender who was older than age 14 but younger than age 16 could be confined for a period not to exceed 45 days but KRS 600.060 stated that notwithstanding any other provision of KRS Chs. 600 to 645, the inherent contempt power of the court was not diminished, so, because KRS 600.060 specifically addressed the juvenile court’s contempt powers, it controlled over the more general limitation on sentencing of public offenders contained in KRS 635.060(4), and a juvenile court was allowed to sentence a public offender to 60 days in detention for being in contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Order modifying the amount of restitution that a juvenile was directed to pay was affirmed because KRS 610.010(13) granted the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to review a previously entered restitution order. Further, the order was not untimely as CR 59.05 did not apply to the entry of the dispositional order. D.F. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 81 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub.

    Defendant, age 17, was properly sentenced for second degree robbery as an adult pursuant to KRS 635.020(4); because a gun was used in the commission of the crimes and because defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court, she fell within the purview of KRS 635.020(4) and not KRS 635.020(2). Chipman v. Commonwealth, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 349 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 2008), review granted, transferred, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Feb. 11, 2009), rev'd, 313 S.W.3d 95, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 2010).

   <p class="p9">
    Since KRS 635.060(4), (5), restricts the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated.

    When a juvenile was adjudicated for being complicit in criminal mischief, it was not plain error to hold the juvenile solely liable for restitution for the resulting damage because (1) KRS 635.060 granted such discretion, (2) an interpretation of KRS 533.030 granting such authority in adult cases applied to juvenile cases, and (3) the order did not contravene the Juvenile Code’s purposes or affect the juvenile’s substantial rights, nor was the order issued at a shocking or jurisprudentially intolerable proceeding.

   <p class="p9">
    Circuit court properly determined that the plain meaning of the phrase, “involving a deadly weapon,” in the statute at issue was broad enough to include both the use and possession of a deadly weapon because, in common usage, “to involve” meant “to include,” as used in the statute, the plain meaning of the phrase was that a deadly weapon was present during or somehow included in the commission of an act, and the statute allowed the juvenile court options, one of which is committing a child to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.

    Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because a plain reading and straightforward application of subsection (4)(a)(1) revealed the juvenile court had the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; because defendant had three prior adjudications, the juvenile court had the authority to commit him to the DJJ for the fourth adjudication.

    Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because subsection (4)(a)(1) gave the juvenile court the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; the decision to conserve judicial resources by holding one disposition hearing to dispose of all four adjudications in no way impacted the nature and character of the prior adjudications because they remained separate and distinct adjudications.

   <p class="p9">
    Defendant juvenile had the requisite criminal history prior to disposition, satisfying the purpose underlying subsection (4)(a)(1), because he repeatedly engaged in disruptive, volatile behavior resulting in the Commonwealth filing multiple petitions against him, which resulted in multiple misdemeanor or Class D felony adjudications; defendant demonstrated an unwillingness to live within the parameters of the law.

    Ky. Rev. Stat.

    In lieu of commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice, if a child is adjudicated a public offender, the court may in its discretion impose a fine. The imposition of a fine for an offense committed by a child shall be based upon a determination that such disposition is in the best interest of the child and to aid in his rehabilitation. Any such order shall include a finding that the child is financially able to pay the fine. Fines shall be levied consistent with the schedule set forth below:
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    For a felony, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500);

   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)

    When a child is directed by the court to pay a fine, the court may provide for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If such provision is not made a part of the court’s disposition, the fine shall be payable immediately. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the court’s inherent contempt powers.

    <span class="boldspan">

    Any public offender detained for failure to comply with the court order shall not be scheduled for a time that would interfere with the educational, occupational, or religious obligations of the child, and shall be in a secure juvenile detention facility or approved detention program authorized by the Department of Juvenile Justice in accordance with KRS Chapter 15A. Any portion of a day a child is detained pursuant to the court’s exercising its contempt powers shall be deemed as one (1) day for purposes of serving a detention term.

    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)

The child shall then be proceeded against in the Circuit Court as an adult, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

    The Circuit Court erred in directing the Division of Probation and Parole to prepare the presentence investigation report as the statute designates that this duty be performed by the Department of Juvenile Justice in cases involving youthful offenders. Gourley v. Commonwealth, 37 S.W.3d 792, 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 10 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Defendant was not afforded an opportunity to controvert the evidence against him in his youthful offender’s sentencing hearing; the trial court should have applied the same procedures as applied in an adult sentencing hearing. Commonwealth v. Jeffries, 95 S.W.3d 60, 2002 Ky. LEXIS 232 (Ky. 2002).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Where expert testimony as to defendant juvenile’s progress and need for additional treatment was relevant to the issue of sentencing and because
    KRS 533.010(2),
    532.050(6), and RCr 11.02 required the trial court to consider probation and alternative sentencing prior to sentencing, the trial court erred in failing to consider the evidence before sentencing pursuant to
    KRS 640.030(2).
    Finley v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 954 (Ky. Ct. App. May 23, 2003).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    KRS 640.030, which permits probation regardless of the offense charged as one of three options the circuit court must consider at an age of majority hearing, controls over the statute on violent offenders, KRS 439.3401, because the statute pertaining to youthful offenders governs treatment of a specific class of offenders regardless of the offense for which they are convicted. Hickman v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 127 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 28, 2006).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Trial courts were not constrained to sentence the juvenile offenders under the terms of the Violent Offender Statute, KRS 439.3401, when the courts were addressing the status of juvenile offenders when they reached the age of 18, pursuant to KRS 640.030; and the sentencing constraints set forth in KRS 439.3401 did not apply to the KRS 640.030 proceedings. Commonwealth v. Merriman, 265 S.W.3d 196, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The “eighteen-year-old hearing,” mandated by KRS 640.030(2), is not comparable, in purpose or effect, to the re-sentencing proceedings for an adult offender. Commonwealth v. Carneal, 274 S.W.3d 420, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 294 (Ky. 2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 906, 130 S. Ct. 274, 175 L. Ed. 2d 184, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 5932 (U.S. 2009).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Statutorily mandated 18-year-old hearing was not a final sentencing because, under KRS 640.030, the trial court had the authority to place a youthful offender on probation or conditional discharge, to return the youthful offender to juvenile custody to complete a treatment plan whereupon he would be finally discharged, or to order transfer to adult corrections. The Circuit Court did not have authority to modify, alter, or otherwise dismiss the underlying sentence. Commonwealth v. Carneal, 274 S.W.3d 420, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 294 (Ky. 2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 906, 130 S. Ct. 274, 175 L. Ed. 2d 184, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 5932 (U.S. 2009).

    Since the term “sentencing procedures” as contained in this section included probation, defendant youthful offender convicted of first degree sodomy and sexual abuse against his sister was not exempt from the prohibition contained in subsection (2) of KRS 532.045 and fact that judge remanded defendant to a sexual offender treatment program as mandated by KRS 439.340(10) was merely compliance with KRS 640.030(4).

   <p class="p9">
    Where a juvenile who had been charged with a capital offense was transferred to circuit court as a youthful offender where she was acquitted on the capital charge, and convicted of a Class C felony, the trial court was without authority to sentence her pursuant to this section, but was limited to the much more lenient dispositions provided by KRS 635.060.

    Subsection (3) applies to the situation in which a juvenile has attained the age of 18 prior to sentencing and gives the court the option of sentencing an 18 year old youthful offender to a youth facility or program for a limited time period despite his having attained the age of majority; however, the section is not mandatory, and the court may in its discretion elect to sentence him to an adult prison.

    The question of whether sentences shall run consecutively or concurrently is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and where the juvenile defendant in a rape and robbery prosecution had a lengthy juvenile court record, the trial judge did not err in imposing consecutive sentences for defendant’s convictions of first-degree rape, first-degree robbery and criminal attempt to commit first-degree robbery. Pevlor v. Commonwealth, 638 S.W.2d 272, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 291 (Ky. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1149, 103 S. Ct. 794, 74 L. Ed. 2d 998, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3136 (U.S. 1983).

     Unpublished decision:
    </i>
    Federal trial court did not err in summarily denying petitioner’s application for writ of habeas corpus because his counsel did not err in not objecting when petitioner was sentenced as an adult, even though he was only 17-years-old when he committed his crimes; petitioner was properly sentenced as an adult because he received individualized consideration before being held to stand trial as an adult and was subject to the same sentence as an adult because he pled guilty, which meant that his counsel did not provide ineffective assistance in not objecting to the proper rulings of the trial court.

    Where a juvenile who had been charged with a capital offense was transferred to Circuit Court as a youthful offender where she was acquitted on the capital charge, and convicted of a Class C felony, the trial court was without authority to sentence her pursuant to KRS 640.030, but was limited to the much more lenient dispositions provided by KRS 635.060. Canter v. Commonwealth, 843 S.W.2d 330, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 181 (Ky. 1992).

   <p class="p9">
    Although the trial court erred by including the sentencing consideration of life without the benefit of probation or parole, a sentencing option in violation of KRS 640.040(1), the error was harmless where a youthful defendant ultimately received a statutorily authorized sentence for intentional murder, i.e., life without parole for twenty-five (25) years.

   <p class="p9">
    This section is a clear legislative pronouncement that youthful offenders shall not be subject to certain dispositions and defendant’s contention that the legislature made a mistake by failing in subsection (3) of this section to except youthful offenders from the prohibitions of KRS 532.045 was disingenuous and defendant was barred from consideration for probation pursuant to KRS 532.045(2). Commonwealth v. Taylor, 945 S.W.2d 420, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 35 (Ky. 1997).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A juvenile offender’s sentence of life without the possibility of parole for twenty-five (25) years was permissible under KRS 640.040(3) because the limitations on probation and parole were imposed by the sentence and not as a function of KRS 533.060 or KRS 439.3401; therefore, at the juvenile offender’s 18-year-old hearing, the trial court did not have the option of ordering probation or conditional discharge, nor did it have the ability to return him to juvenile custody to complete a treatment program. By virtue of the sentence itself, the trial court’s only option was to transfer the offender to adult custody. Commonwealth v. Carneal, 274 S.W.3d 420, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 294 (Ky. 2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 906, 130 S. Ct. 274, 175 L. Ed. 2d 184, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 5932 (U.S. 2009).

    A 17-year-old juvenile convicted of first degree manslaughter, but mentally ill, qualifies as an adult offender under § 635.020(4) because he committed a felony with a firearm, so is subject to the same penalties as an adult pursuant to RCr 3.07. Thus, the protection subsection (3) of this section offers youthful offenders against the limitation on probation set out in 533.060(1) is withdrawn by § 635.020(4). Mullins v.

    Defendant, age 17, was properly sentenced for second degree robbery as an adult pursuant to KRS 635.020(4); because a gun was used in the commission of the crimes and because defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court, she fell within the purview of KRS 635.020(4) and not KRS 635.020(2). Chipman v. Commonwealth, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 349 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 2008), review granted, transferred, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Feb. 11, 2009), rev'd, 313 S.W.3d 95, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 2010).

    Defendant was exempt from youthful offender sentencing under KRS 640.040(4), because there was no evidence that defendant committed a felony and that a firearm was used in the commission of that felony; defendant’s statement that one of the adult males accompanying defendant was carrying a gun was not an admission that defendant used the gun, and there was no stipulation to using a firearm in the plea agreement.

However, a juvenile defendant can not be found to impliedly waive a right to which the defendant was not explicitly made aware. Kozak v. Commonwealth, 279 S.W.3d 129, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 291 (Ky. 2008).

    It was not error for the Department of Corrections (DOC) to classify defendant, who had been sentenced as a youthful offender, as a violent offender, with the attendant parole eligibility limitations, because, inter alia, KRS 640.040(3), barring applying limitations on probation, parole, or conditional discharge to youthful offenders, did not compel such a result, as the statute did not so state, and this interpretation was implausible given the youthful offender statutory scheme’s reference to the Violent Offender Statute, KRS 439.3401.
