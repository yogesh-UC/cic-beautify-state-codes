    Persons in jail who have been convicted of misdemeanors may register to vote by mail and may vote by absentee ballot. OAG 75-135.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There are no statutory provisions for taking persons from jail either to register or vote or for election officials to go to the jail with registration forms or election ballots. OAG 75-135.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A registered voter who moves from one precinct in the county to another more than 30 days before the election but fails to notify the county clerk of his change of residence until after the registration books have closed cannot vote in his new precinct, although he may attempt to vote in his old precinct, assuming his name has not been purged and remains on the registration list when sent to the precinct. OAG 75-622.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Persons incarcerated in jail but not yet convicted of any crime are entitled to register to vote, and after they have been duly registered and presumably qualified to vote they may then make application for an absentee ballot. OAG 76-202.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    People who were registered as 17-year-olds, but who would be 18 by the November general election will not be eligible to vote in a special local option election to be held the preceding March. OAG 79-41.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A city annexing a university area could not strengthen the voting requirements since the voting qualifications are controlled by the Constitution and state statutes. OAG 82-157.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Only those persons who can qualify to vote may register to vote, which excludes any person who has been convicted of a felony and incarcerated in prison; as a consequence, if the recipients of certain requested voter registration applications are to be convicted felons incarcerated in prison, the county court clerk can legally refuse to comply with the request since the applicants would not be entitled to register and vote. OAG 83-411.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Even though a voter’s registration form may be illegally filled in, insofar as party preference is concerned, when it is submitted to the clerk with the required information contained therein, the clerk would be required to accept it as a valid registration and the voter in question would be considered legally registered and entitled to vote. OAG 85-131.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A person whose party affiliation was designated on the registration card without his knowledge or consent could only vote and seek office in the succeeding party primary as a member of that party and would be disqualified as to the other party primary. OAG 85-131.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Party affiliation is of no consequence insofar as one’s voting rights are concerned at the November election. OAG 85-131.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A person is qualified to vote provided he meets the constitutional qualifications enumerated under Ky. Const., § 145 as modified by the Supreme Court of the United States and as reflected in this section and the registration requirement found in KRS 116.045. OAG 85-131.

    An individual can come into Kentucky, take up residence in a particular precinct and immediately register to vote if he will satisfy, on the day of the next regular election, the 30-day residential requirement found in KRS 116.025. OAG 74-640.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A registered voter who moves from one precinct in the county to another more than 30 days before the election but fails to notify the county clerk of his change of residence until after the registration books have closed cannot vote in his new precinct, although he may attempt to vote in his old precinct, assuming his name has not been purged and remains on the registration list when sent to the precinct. OAG 75-622.

   <p class="p7">
    Although the county clerk is vested with reasonable discretion in determining whether or not registration forms are distributed to responsible individuals and organizations, the clerk cannot arbitrarily refuse, without good reason, any individual or group access to a reasonable number of blank registration forms. OAG 76-742.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Registration forms can be accepted for registration purposes only during the period that the registration books are legally open, but distribution of blank forms is not restricted to a particular time or period during the year. OAG 76-742.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Nothing under this section governs or restricts the manner of distributing the blank registration forms after they have been obtained from the clerk’s office pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, but the method of registration, outside of the clerk’s office or branch offices, must be approved by the State board as provided in subsection (4)(d) of this section. OAG 78-570.

   <p class="p7">
    A change of political affiliation by a qualified voter is of no legal consequence with respect to his right to participate in any special or general election, which simply means that though a voter may be disqualified in the May primary from voting, he is not disqualified from participating in any special election. OAG 79-79.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provisions of this section and KRS 116.055 are not in conflict with each other with respect to the time at which a voter may change party affiliation without being disfranchised in the primary or general election, since this section provides for qualifications which a voter possesses or will possess on the day of the next regular election and KRS 116.055 governs voting in a primary election, which is not an election under the Kentucky Constitution but is merely a nominating procedure for the major parties. OAG 81-113.

   <p class="p7">
    The authorization provided in this section for local distribution by the county clerk of blank voter registration cards to any individual or groups of individuals, would include the right of an individual who is running for political office to obtain a reasonable number of the registration cards, with the number to be determined by the clerk. OAG 81-255.

    Only those persons who can qualify to vote may register to vote, which excludes any person who has been convicted of a felony and incarcerated in prison; as a consequence, if the recipients of certain requested voter registration applications are to be convicted felons incarcerated in prison, the county court clerk can legally refuse to comply with the request since the applicants would not be entitled to register and vote.

Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 93 S. Ct. 1245, 36 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 92 (1973), rehearing denied, Rosario v. Rockefeller, 411 U.S. 959, 93 S. Ct. 1920, 36 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). OAG 75-271.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Voter registered as an independent could not change his party affiliation to Republican or Democrat in February so as to qualify to vote in the May primary and thereby become eligible to be a candidate in the May primary under KRS 118.125, which requires candidates to be qualified to vote under this section. OAG 76-78.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Any voter who was a registered member of one of the two major political parties and was so registered as of the 1975 November election was eligible to vote in the succeeding primary of his party in May 1976, but a voter who changed his party affiliation after the November election would be disqualified from voting in the primary for candidates of either party. OAG 76-293.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A registered Democrat who decides to run for office as an independent in the fall election may vote as a Democrat in the spring primary election prior to the next fall election so long as he was registered as a Democrat in the fall election preceding the spring primary and provided he remains registered as a Democrat through the spring primary. OAG 81-55.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provisions of KRS 116.045 and this section are not in conflict with each other with respect to the time at which a voter may change party affiliation without being disfranchised in the primary or general election, since KRS 116.045 provides for qualifications which a voter possesses or will possess on the day of the next regular election and this section governs voting in a primary election, which is not an election under the Kentucky Constitution but rather merely a nominating procedure for the major parties. OAG 81-113.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where one of the electors executing an affidavit on behalf of a candidate changed his party affiliation subsequent to the last November election, he is disqualified as a qualified elector for the primary election, since he must not only have been affiliated with the candidate’s party at the last November election but must also remain so affiliated under this section; thus, the candidate in question should withdraw his filing papers and execute one that complies with the statutory requirement since his papers are defective, but he may, upon notification under KRS 118.165 correct such error not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline; otherwise his name shall not be placed on the ballot. OAG 81-126.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where an individual changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican subsequent to the 1984 November election, he was disqualified from becoming a candidate in the May primary for either party; he could, however, change his registration back to that of Democrat and be qualified to seek nomination as a member of that party, or he could run as an independent. OAG 85-42.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A candidate is eligible to run in the 1993 primary if he changed his party affiliation after the November 1992 election, and then switched back to his original party affiliation before filing to run in the primary. OAG 93-8.

    A political party, in conducting a voter registration campaign, may not lawfully predesignate the prospective voter’s party affiliation by pre-stamping or otherwise completing the “party affiliation” block with the name of the political party conducting the registration effort, since the registration form required to be prepared by the State Board of Elections pursuant to this section and which contains among other things a place for party designation is to be filled in and signed by the person seeking to register for the purpose of voting.

    Even though a voter’s registration form may be illegally filled in, insofar as party preference is concerned, when it is submitted to the clerk with the required information contained therein, the clerk would be required to accept it as a valid registration and the voter in question would be considered legally registered and entitled to vote.

    The power to appoint members of boards and agencies
    within the executive department of government is an essentially executive
    power which cannot be exercised by any member of the legislative department;
    accordingly, the provisions in this section by which the Speaker of the House
    of Representatives and the President Pro Tem of the Senate are authorized
    to make appointments to the State Board of Elections are an invalid unconstitutional
    incursion by the General Assembly, or in this case, its designees, into the
    separation of powers doctrine. Legislative Research Com. by Prather v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 1984 Ky. LEXIS 300 (Ky. 1984) (decision prior to 1988 amendment).

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    The use of a computer to perform the normal function
    of the county board with respect to the tabulation of votes by hand should
    be authorized by the State Board of Elections, since said board has the over-all
    supervision and administration of the election laws of the state; but if the
    plan was to have the county board tabulate the votes in the normal manner
    and, at the same time, supervise the feeding of the vote tally into the computer
    to determine, in effect, which method proves to be the quickest and most accurate,
    there should be no legal objection. OAG 75-229.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In the absence of any specific statute concerning
    the length of time old registration records are to be retained by a local
    board, the state board of elections would be authorized to adopt a regulation
    fixing a time after which such records may be destroyed. OAG 76-64.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Those members of the State Board of Elections who
    were appointed by members of the General Assembly, whose appointments the
    Supreme Court held to be invalid, continue to serve as de facto officers until
    they either resign or are removed individually or collectively; however, they
    are not entitled to receive any compensation for duties imposed upon and performed
    by them by virtue of the office, nor can they forcibly require the payment
    of such compensation. OAG 84-212.

    Upon review of this section and KRS 12.020 I 3. (b),
    as well as of KRS 18A.350, 18A.355, and 18A.360 (repealed), the incumbents
    of the Board of Elections are included under the language of KRS 18A.350 which
    defines employee as any officer or employee of the executive branch of government;
    therefore, it would appear that the members of the board of elections are
    eligible for annual increments, although it is entirely possible that this
    was not the intent of the legislature. OAG 90-25.

    The State Board of Elections
    may declare a county to be a preclearance county for election purposes when
    that county has a history of voter fraud, noncompliance with election laws,
    or voter complaints about the integrity of a particular election. In a county
    designated as a preclearance county, all decisions of the county board of
    elections shall be reported to the State Board of Elections for its review.
    The failure of a county board of elections of a preclearance county to submit
    its decisions to the State Board of Elections for its review shall constitute
    a prima facie case for appointment of an election manager under KRS 117.022.
    The State Board of Elections may require a preclearance county to submit evidence
    or justification as required by the state board which is necessary to evaluate
    the county board’s decisions. A county designated as a preclearance county
    shall retain that designation until it is removed by the State Board of Elections.

    The restrictions contained in subsection (3)(h) of

   <p class="p7">
    In the absence of any specific statute concerning
    the length of time old registration records are to be retained by a local
    board, the State Board of Elections would be authorized to adopt a regulation
    fixing a time after which such records may be destroyed. OAG 76-64.

   <p class="p7">
    This section merely mandates that the State Board
    of Elections shall put into precinct list form all of the registered voters
    of the state and make those lists available to candidates and other persons;
    there are no restrictive words except to the effect that the precinct list
    shall not be used for commercial purposes. OAG 79-77.

   <p class="p7">
    The phrase “ . . . . .
    employ, on a bipartisan basis
    . . . . . ” as used in subsection (2) of this section simply
    means that the board should employ its personnel on the basis of their qualifications,
    experience, etc., irrespective of the individual’s party affiliation, so long

    with the board itself. OAG 80-656.

    For a member of the State Board of Elections to either
    participate in the discussion of the applicants for the position of executive
    director or to cast a vote in filling the position, for which said member
    is a candidate, would create a common-law conflict of interest as being against
    public policy and self-serving. OAG 84-16.

    The decision of the Commonwealth Board of Elections
    to deny the request for copies of precinct lists and mailing labels in connection

    The County Clerk’s reliance on KRS 61.878(1)(a) as the basis for denying access to the voter assistance forms identified in the request was, with the exception of the protection it extends to social security numbers appearing on those forms, misplaced.

    Since the offices of employee of the state highway

    Since a county clerk would be disqualified from participating

    Inasmuch as two members of the county board of elections

    Since announcement for a public office is not made

    to perform their duties, including the selection of election officers on or
    before September 20 as prescribed in KRS 117.045 through the year preceding
    the candidacy for public office, unless, prior to such election, they become
    candidates under any of the conditions set forth in the definition of candidates
    set forth in subsection (7) of KRS 121.015; in addition, they would, of course,

    When the sheriff is a candidate for another public

    There is no question that the fiscal court can from
    time to time alter the compensation of members of the county board of elections
    (the only restriction being that it cannot go below $15.00 per meeting) since
    members of the commission are not constitutionally named officers whose compensation
    cannot be changed during their term, but where the fiscal court initially
    fixed the compensation at $24.00 per meeting, which remained unchanged from
    1976 through the 1978 election, it could not enter a subsequent order reducing
    the compensation already earned by the commissioners by making the order retroactive,
    regardless of whether or not a sufficient amount was budgeted. OAG 78-789.

    Although any change in a precinct boundary must be

    Since there is no publication requirement of any such
    actions taken by the board before they become effective, the board can call
    a meeting at any time that it deems necessary to make a proposed boundary
    change, and after making the change and upon recording same in its records,
    such change would become effective. OAG 79-609.

   <p class="p7">
    An individual holding the office of magistrate can
    at the same time serve on the county board of elections, since no constitutional

    another county office to serve on the county board of elections. OAG 80-263.

   <p class="p7">
    The employment of a staff by a county board of election
    pursuant to subsection (5) of this section must be interpreted as discretionary
    by the board; an interpretation that the subsection is mandatory would violate
    the separate powers doctrine contained in Const., § 27 and Const.,
    § 28 because the legislature would have statutorily predetermined

    terminate employees, authority to direct the day to day operations of said
    board and its staff, authority to purchase any necessary supplies and equipment,
    and authority to act as the principal spokesperson of said board and its staff,

    the employment of personnel is the responsibility of the entire board; moreover,
    since subsection (3) of this section provides that the county clerk shall
    serve as chairman of the meetings and may vote, but does not authorize the

    Although the board, if possible, should avoid splitting
    magisterial district lines, it is not required to do so and may combine two
    precincts in different magisterial districts into one precinct where necessary
    to comply with the terms of this section regarding voter distribution. OAG
    74-544; modified by OAG 77-126.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The requirement of KRS 25.700 (repealed) that no boundary
    line of a justice district shall cross the boundary line of an election precinct
    in no way controls the realignment of precinct boundaries by the county board
    of elections. OAG 74-544; modified by OAG 77-126.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a school division line bisects a precinct, the
    county board of elections and the school board should work together in determining
    the actual location of the eligible voters in each school division who will
    be voting in a particular precinct and the school board should assist the
    clerk by furnishing him with such a breakdown since the school board is in
    a better position to know the location of the school boundary lines and the
    board should also furnish the clerk with a map showing the school boundary
    lines so that the clerk can, in turn, determine in which school division within
    the split precinct the voters reside and thereby mark the registration list
    that goes to the precinct in such a manner as to enable the election officers
    to set the machine correctly before each voter proceeds to vote. OAG 76-367.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A change in precinct boundaries and the reapportionment
    of magisterial districts are in no way connected in point of time and, as
    a consequence, there is no requirement that one be initiated before the other.
    OAG 76-745.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where precinct lines coincide a single voting place
    may be established in one place to permit the voters in both precincts to
    vote at the same place. OAG 77-43.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In view of the 1976 amendment to this section and
    the requirement that magisterial district lines shall not bisect precinct
    lines found under KRS 25.700 (repealed), the reapportionment commissioners
    and the county board of elections should make a concerted effort to see that
    precinct boundary lines and magisterial boundary lines comply with the respective
    statutes and due to the fact that the magisterial boundary lines must comply
    with the equal population factor under the “one man, one vote”
    rule it would be easier for the county board of elections to change the precinct
    lines so as to coincide with the magisterial district lines after the county
    has been reapportioned. OAG 77-126, modifying OAG 74-544.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section would permit only one voting place in
    any one precinct, though such voting place could be utilized by a number of
    precincts where it is located on or near joining precinct lines. OAG 77-554.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county board, in its discretion, may create a new
    voting precinct composed of an annexed territory where it deems necessary
    to do so, so long as it is done not less than 55 days before the May primary.
    OAG 79-99.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It is mandatory for the county board of elections
    to review the boundaries of a precinct exceeding 700 voters, but the county
    board of elections may give permission to exceed 700 voters in a registered
    precinct and still be within the law. OAG 79-298.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county election board may relocate a precinct county
    line, so as to place a country club entirely within one “wet”
    precinct before a local option election is held in a second precinct containing
    half the club where the change would be wholly within the boundary of one
    magisterial or commissioners’ district and would not affect the precinct location
    of any voter. OAG 79-609.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    No precinct boundary line can cross a magisterial
    boundary line which is the political territory having the less area within
    the county’s boundaries with the exception of municipal boundaries. OAG 79-609.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    After reapportionment involving changes from the prior
    reapportionment, it is the responsibility of the county board of elections
    to so draw or redraw precinct boundary lines so that no precinct line bisects
    or crosses a magisterial line, as last established under reapportionment,
    but the precinct lines are irrelevant as concerns reapportionment itself.
    OAG 80-69.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The 1980 Legislature amended this section to change
    the method of determining the size of the precincts by eliminating the requirement
    that it be based on the number of registered voters and providing in its place
    that it shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last regular
    election. OAG 80-378.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The size of election precincts must be based on the
    number of votes cast at the last regular election rather than the number of
    registered voters within the precinct. OAG 80-527.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The establishment of magisterial districts is done
    by the work of the commissioners of reapportionment as finally treated by
    fiscal court ordinance. The coordination of precinct boundaries with magisterial
    districts is the separate burden of the county board of elections under this
    section. OAG 82-451.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A location of one voting place in a city to serve
    several adjacent precincts would be perfectly proper so long as the actual
    voting would be held in separate rooms for each precinct. OAG 82-511.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a new districting plan included a city plus
    some additional area within the magisterial district, since the city could
    divide its area into a number of precincts, the board could establish one
    voting place at the courthouse or any other location that was reasonably close
    to the precinct lines where the voters of all such precints could vote. OAG
    82-511.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a fiscal court adopts a plan for reapportionment
    of magisterial districts that meets the provisions of KRS 67.045, yet divides
    one or more voting precincts, since both the reapportionment act, KRS 67.045,
    and this section, prohibit a precinct line from bisecting or crossing a magisterial
    district line and particularly following reapportionment as required by KRS 67.045, following reapportionment the county board of elections must alter
    any precinct that has been crossed by virtue of reapportionment in order to
    conform with the requirements of KRS 67.045 and this section. OAG 82-617;
    OAG 82-621.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section prohibits the fiscal court from changing
    the present precinct boundary lines until the Kentucky General Assembly has
    enacted redistricting legislation; the county board of elections has the exclusive
    authority to alter precinct boundaries rather than the fiscal court. OAG 91-55.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the written description with regard to precinct
    boundaries did not correspond with the precinct map, the map is the primary
    document with regard to precinct boundaries. However, if there is a serious
    discrepancy this would be a factual question which this office cannot answer
    and which would require a determination by the court. OAG 91-55.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under this section, lines are to be drawn by the county
    board of elections and the reapportionment commission has no authority to
    establish a precinct boundary. OAG 92-58.

    Any covered voter as defined in KRS 117A.010 who has received a mail-in absentee ballot but who knows that he or she will be in the county on election day and who has not voted pursuant to the provisions of KRS 117.086 shall cancel his or her mail-in absentee ballot and vote in person. The voter shall return the mail-in absentee ballot to the county clerk’s office on or before election day. Upon the return of the mail-in absentee ballot, the county clerk shall mark on the outer envelope of the sealed mail-in absentee ballot or the unmarked mail-in absentee ballot the words “Canceled because voter appeared to vote in person.” Sealed envelopes so marked shall not be opened. If the covered voter is unable to return the mail-in absentee ballot to the county clerk’s office on or before election day, at the time he or she votes in person, he or she shall sign a written oath as to his or her qualifications on the form prescribed by the State Board of Elections pursuant to KRS 117.245. The county clerk shall remove the voter’s name from the list of persons who were sent mail-in absentee ballots, provide the voter with written authorization to vote at the precinct, and the voter may vote in the precinct in which he or she is properly registered.

    The application for an absentee ballot must be considered
    as having been made when properly mailed and the actual receipt by the clerk
    within the specified time is not required. Queenan v. Russell, 339 S.W.2d 475, 1960 Ky. LEXIS 469 (Ky. 1960) (decided under prior law).

    Former sections governing applications for absentee

    Merely furnishing a list to the officers present

    Substantial evidence supported the trial court’s finding that a clear majority of the walk-in absentee votes cast in one district were tainted because (1) improper addresses were provided; (2) persons obtaining absentee ballots were actually in the county on election day; and (3) voters not entitled to assistance with voting machines under Kentucky law obtained such assistance.

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    Election was declared void because (1) a county board of elections did not substantially comply with absentee ballot counting requirements, (2) there were repeated Corrupt Practices Act violations and misconduct during voting on election day, and (3) cumulative departures from statutory mandates disfranchised legal voters or those who cast valid absentee ballots.

    Alleged irregularities relating to the in-house absentee process did not justify nullifying an election for judge executive where
    Ky Rev. Stat. Ann. § 117.085(1)(h) disclosed no requirement for each board member to be present at the in-house voting site, and the four occasion in which a deputy county clerk or Democrat election commissioner assisted voters with no one else present were not so widespread as to invalidate the entire absentee balloting process under the Ragan-Warren standard.

    Election officials' failure to obtain the voter's telephone number and social security number did not render the absentee voter application invalid or illegal where
    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 117.085(2) did not direct the clerk or the election officials to obtain that information, no other law so provide, and the name and address of the voter on the application provided adequate identifying information.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters. United States v. Risner, 737 Fed. Appx. 751, 2018 FED App. 0304N, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 16252 (6th Cir. Ky. 2018).

    Where two entirely separate elections were to take
    place on the same day, since the Legislature has failed to provide a method
    of procedure for printing and issuing ballots for such combined elections,
    it would be deemed in the best interests of all concerned to have a separate
    ballot printed for each of such elections, and sent separately by the county
    clerk, to those who properly applied for an absent voter’s ballot. Martin v. Moore, 306 S.W.2d 98, 1957 Ky. LEXIS 18 (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior
    law).

    Kentucky statutes that prohibited disclosing names and temporary addresses of absentee voters prior to election, did not infringe upon candidates' free speech rights because First Amendment does not require government to disclose information to candidates in order to facilitate their campaign efforts.

   <p class="p7">
    Since this section provides that the clerk shall retain
    the absent voters’ applications until 30 days (now 22 months) after the election,
    the clerk should not turn over the applications to the state police before
    the expiration of the 30-day period (now 22 months) unless he is presented
    with a court order directing him to do so. OAG 77-727.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If the voter furnishes sufficient identification on
    the telephone to the satisfaction of the clerk, such method of making application
    for the form would be legal under the terms of the statute. OAG 78-424.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provision in this section that the voter may make
    application to the clerk in person or by mail for an absentee ballot can only
    refer to the return of the application form, properly filled out by the voter,
    to the clerk for his absentee ballot, and could not be construed to refer
    to obtaining the application form by the voter for future submission back
    to the clerk for his absentee ballot. OAG 78-424.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county clerk cannot hand deliver any absent voter’s
    ballot but must mail all such ballots to the voter. OAG 79-311.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A voter who desires to vote absentee could, pursuant
    to this section, request an application form for an absent ballot from the
    clerk by telephone, provided the clerk could properly identify the voter.
    OAG 80-416.

   <p class="p7">
    Where the clerk’s seal was inadvertently left off
    the application form and there was ample evidence that the form was in fact
    sent to the voter from the clerk’s office and received from the voter properly
    filled out and signed, the statutory requirement of this section has been
    substantially complied with; therefore, the application form sent to and returned
    by the voter would be valid. Added weight to this conclusion is the fact that
    the voter has complied with the statutory requirements imposed on him in making
    application and returning same and should not be penalized for an error committed
    on the part of the clerk or one of his deputies. OAG 83-436.

   <p class="p7">
    Absentee ballots and applications which were in the
    custody of the circuit clerk pending an election contest suit were “public

    OAG 83-476.

   <p class="p7">
    Although there is no specific statute under the election
    laws declaring that a voter’s application for an absentee ballot required
    to be made under KRS 117.075 or this section becomes a public record open
    to public inspection, the completed application constitutes a public record
    to which the county clerk cannot deny access. OAG 84-166.

   <p class="p7">
    Since subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section which
    requires county clerks to have election ballots printed 50 days before the
    election and KRS 83A.045 under certain conditions allows candidates for city
    offices in certain small cities to file for office up to 30 days before election,
    are patent and irreconcilable, county clerks should proceed with the printing
    of the ballots as required by subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section even
    though there is still time for some candidates to file for certain city offices;
    if a candidate later files for one (1) of the city races, the clerk may reprint
    the ballots for the precincts within the affected city. With regard to city
    voters who may receive an absentee ballot while the filing period is still
    open, the situation should be disclosed to them by attaching a notice to the
    absentee ballot so that they may choose to withhold voting until all the candidates
    are known. OAG 93-62.

    Legislation providing for “no-excuse absentee voting,” or early voting, in order to comply with federal law, a final court decision binding the Commonwealth, or rights recognized in the Bill of Rights of the Kentucky Constitution would not require an amendment to the Kentucky Constitution.

    Where, due to a multiplicity of city elections filed

    may determine that an emergency exists authorizing the use of paper ballots.
    OAG 75-610.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a county court clerk is not required to print
    a number of special paper ballots equal to any specified percentage of the
    registered voters within the county, the clerk’s judgment on this matter should
    be based on the number of registered voters in the county, while taking into
    consideration the amount needed in previous elections. OAG 76-213.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no requirement that the words “absent”
    or “special” be printed on ballots mailed to absentee and disabled
    voters, therefore one type of paper ballot can be used both as an absent ballot
    and as an emergency ballot. OAG 76-213.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The statutory requirement pertaining to the printing
    of special ballots for absent voters, disabled voters and for voting in emergency
    situations constitutes an election expense to be paid for by the fiscal court
    pursuant to the terms of KRS 117.345 and such costs cannot be allowed as a
    necessary office expense of the county court clerk under KRS 64.345. OAG 76-474.

    KRS 424.260 has no application to this section since
    the latter statute provides for special purchases of election supplies by
    the county clerk and contains no express provisions for competitive bidding.
    OAG 76-496.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section and KRS 117.265 were inserted to clarify

    Competition is not feasible in applying this section,
    thus under KRS 45A.380, an exception to competitive bidding, if the county
    clerk will in writing determine that competition is not feasible and that
    an emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of delay in competitive
    procedures, or that there is a single source of the service to be performed,
    then if the fiscal court will approve the clerk’s declarations, the clerk
    may procure such supplies by means of noncompetitive negotiation. OAG 80-180.

   <p class="p7">
    It would be improper for a write-in candidate to use

    Where, due to a multiplicity of city elections filed
    for in a single election year within a county, the county has an insufficient
    number of voting machines, the county board of elections and the county clerk
    may determine that an emergency exists authorizing the use of paper ballots.
    OAG 75-610.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no requirement that the words “absent”
    or “special” be printed on ballots mailed to absentee and disabled

    and as an emergency ballot. OAG 76-213.

    A county clerk is not required to have special ballots,

    In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters.

    The phrase “within fifty feet of the polls”
    contained in a former version of subsection (3) of this section meant within
    50 feet of the door to the polling place. OAG 74-473.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In counties where the fiscal court or legislative
    body of an urban-county government have not enacted a county wide electioneering
    ordinance, the providing of transportation and the hauling of voters to the
    polls on election day would not themselves constitute actions in violation
    of the statute. OAG 74-773.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Challengers may stay within the voting room while
    the vote is being polled, the election judges having no authority to eject
    them therefrom, and the challengers may exercise reasonable discretion in
    deciding where in the room they will post themselves, including withdrawing
    from the voting room when they feel it necessary. OAG 75-95.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    It is clear that where the courtroom was selected
    as the voting place on election day, no one should have been permitted to
    have access to the room during the period that the polls were open other than
    the election officers, challengers and those persons desiring to cast their
    vote, which would exclude the city judge and members of the police force.
    OAG 75-408.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The posting of political signs and posters in the
    vicinity of the polls does not appear to constitute “electioneering”
    as restricted by this section, but such material should be placed prior to
    the opening of the polls on election day. OAG 75-627.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Political posters erected before the polls open would
    not constitute a form of electioneering, but during polling hours posters
    cannot be erected in or around the polling place or within the prohibited
    radius established pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. OAG 75-627,
    77-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The term “electioneering” means where
    a person, through some overt action, tries to sway a voter to vote for a particular
    candidate or public question by persuasion, harassment or intimidation and
    this definition would prevent the handing out of political cards and literature
    at the polling place or within the area outside established by law in which
    electioneering is prohibited. OAG 77-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Political posters cannot be placed on the voting booth
    itself under any circumstances even though erected prior to the opening of
    the polls. OAG 77-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    People cannot congregate outside of the election booth
    and even the officers and challengers should not in any way interfere with
    the election process by congregating outside of the voting booth; of course,
    one of the judges must be there to operate the machine but the rest of the
    perimeter should be clear of the election officials and challengers. OAG 77-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    By this section the Legislature did not intend to
    bar electioneering throughout a county but rather to authorize the fiscal
    court to specifically establish a distance from the polling place beyond which
    electioneering may be permitted. OAG 77-318.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    By failing to establish a specific distance, beyond
    the minimum of 50 feet contained in a former version of subsection (3) of
    this section prior to amendment, from the polling place where electioneering
    may be permitted (as for example, 50, 100 or 200 feet), this section makes
    it impossible to determine this fact unless the intent is to bar electioneering
    throughout the county; the Legislature could not have intended this, since
    it would not only be unreasonable but also unenforceable. OAG 78-425.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The electioneering statute poses a serious question
    as to its validity because of vagueness with respect to the distance from
    the polls, beyond the 50-foot minimum contained in a former version of subsection
    (3) prior to amendment, that electioneering may be permitted where the fiscal
    court or legislative body fails to enact appropriate legislation. OAG 78-425.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A literal interpretation of subsection (1) of this
    section thwarts certain basic First Amendment rights of the media to gather
    and disseminate news; thus, the media should be allowed to enter the polling
    place for the very limited purpose of filming or observing the electoral process
    for a limited time. OAG 88-76.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Electioneering, as defined in this section, broadly
    encompasses all activities, including such passive activities as wearing a
    campaign button, that solicit a vote for or against a candidate or issue.
    (overruling OAG 1984-94). OAG 92-73.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section may be fully enforced to prohibit electioneering
    by precinct officers, since the state’s compelling need to maintain orderly
    elections outweighs the first amendment rights of the precinct officers, but
    the first amendment prohibits enforcement of this section to prohibit voters
    from wearing items such as buttons or shirts that solicit a vote for or against
    a candidate or issue, although the first amendment does not allow a voter
    to disrupt the voting process by persistent appeals to other voters who do
    not wish to be subjected to such communication; passive communication such
    as wearing a hat, button, or shirt is permissible; oral solicitation of votes,
    or other more intrusive communication, is not. OAG 92-73.

    The procedure for executing the voter oath under the
    terms of this section is designed for use where there exists some record of
    the voter having been registered but nevertheless his right to be registered
    has been challenged; but if no registration record exists at the polls, he
    should not be permitted to vote under oath and must seek relief before the
    county board, county court or Circuit Court. OAG 75-409.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although registration constitutes only prima facie
    evidence of a person’s right to vote and does not prevent the officers of
    any election from refusing to allow him to vote for cause, if his right to
    vote is challenged, the voter may sign a written oath as to his qualifications
    and then be permitted to vote. OAG 76-304.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a challenger can observe a voter signing
    the registration record, check the signature and challenge the qualifications
    of the voter, he cannot enter the voting booth to observe the voter casting
    his vote. OAG 77-401.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A nonregistered voter would be required to appear
    before the county board on election day for permission to vote or, being refused
    the right, appeal to a Circuit Court. OAG 78-785.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When a voter moves to another precinct but fails to
    notify the clerk to change his registration, he is still prima facie eligible
    to vote in his old precinct until purged by the board pursuant to KRS 116.115
    (repealed); such voter can, of course, be challenged at the polls, however,
    he may execute the voter’s oath and proceed to vote under the terms of this

    Except for those voters who have been certified as requiring assistance on a permanent basis, no voter shall be permitted to receive any assistance in voting at the polls unless he makes and signs an oath that, because of blindness, other physical disability, or an inability to read English, he is unable to vote without assistance. The oath shall be upon a voter assistance form prescribed by the State Board of Elections. Any person assisting a voter shall complete the voter assistance form.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)

    Upon making and filing the oath with the precinct clerk, the voter requiring assistance shall retire to the voting machine or ballot completion area with the precinct judges, and one (1) of the judges shall, in the presence of the other judge and the voter, operate the machine or complete the ballot as the voter directs. A voter requiring assistance in voting may, if he prefers, be assisted by a person of his own choice who is not an election officer, except that the voter’s employer, an agent of the voter’s employer, or an officer or agent of the voter’s union shall not assist a voter.

    A voter who requires voting assistance on a permanent basis because of blindness or other physical disability may apply to the county board of elections for certification. Application may be made when registering to vote or completing the voter assistance form by indicating that the reason for obtaining assistance is permanent. The county board of elections shall determine whether the applicant requires assistance on a permanent basis. The county board of elections shall notify the county clerk of persons certified as requiring permanent voting assistance and the county clerk shall enter the certification on the voter’s registration record. The State Board of Elections shall indicate on the precinct roster of voters those voters who are certified to receive assistance permanently without signing the voter assistance form at the precinct.

    “Voting booth” or “ballot completion area” means an area in which a voter casts his vote or completes his ballot which is designed to insure the secrecy of the vote. No voter shall be assisted under this subsection unless the judges and the sheriff of election are satisfied of the truth of the facts stated in the oath. The voter shall state in his oath the specific reason that requires him to receive assistance.

    In primary elections, before a voter is permitted to use the voting machine, a judge of the election shall adjust the machine so that the voter will only be able to vote for the persons for whom the voter is qualified to vote.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (9)

    If the machine is so constructed as to require adjustment after one person has voted before another person may vote, the judges of election shall adjust it after each person has voted.

    <span class="boldspan">

    If supplemental paper ballots have been approved, as provided in KRS 118.215, the voter shall vote his ballot in privacy in a booth provided for that purpose by the county clerk. If the voter spoils his ballot, he shall return the spoiled paper ballot to an election official who shall stamp the ballot “Spoiled,” initial and place the spoiled ballot in an envelope provided for that purpose. The voter shall be issued a second supplemental paper ballot. Upon completion of voting, the voter shall remove the numbered stub from the ballot, hand the stub to an election official and deposit the voted ballot in the locked ballot box in the presence of precinct election officials.

    No one, including an election officer, is authorized
    to assist a voter by entering the voting booth unless such voter is physically
    disabled and executes an oath to that effect, and any election officer violating
    this section is subject to prosecution under the penalty section of KRS 117.995.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section clearly authorizes the disabled voter
    to select a person of his own choice other than the two election judges to
    assist him in voting and precinct challengers would qualify for selection
    by the disabled voter to assist him in voting if he so chooses. OAG 77-205.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a disabled voter is refused the assistance provided
    for in this section, he must either refer the matter to the county board of
    elections that is in session on election day or take the matter directly to
    Circuit Court. OAG 77-269.

    Subsection (2) of this section permits a voter to
    be assisted in voting if he signs an oath that by reason of inability to read
    English or by reason of blindness or other physical disability he is unable
    to vote without assistance and, if the disabled voter prefers, he can be assisted
    by a person of his own choice. OAG 79-291.

    An individual who is unable to read English qualifies

    he may be to a degree literate and able to understand certain words but is
    unable to read and understand the names of various candidates and the instruction
    in the voting machine, since this fact would not disqualify him from receiving
    assistance in voting as provided in this section; however, it is basically
    not the duty of the election officials to determine the extent of that person’s
    disability, if he is willing to swear or affirm that he possesses such disability.

    The County Clerk’s reliance on KRS 61.878(1)(a) as the basis for denying access to the voter assistance forms identified in the request was, with the exception of the protection it extends to social security numbers appearing on those forms, misplaced.

    The “governing authority” of the party

   <p class="p7">
    It was the duty of the county clerk to retain custody
    of the boxes and ballots, although he was a candidate for re-election and
    was contesting the election of an opponent; but it was permissible, by consent
    of the interested parties, for the clerk in such case to have placed the boxes
    in the custody of a bank or in some other safe depository, which the clerk
    must have, however, selected with the greatest care. Thomas v. Marshall, 160 Ky. 168, 169 S.W. 615, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 420 (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

   <p class="p7">
    It was the duty of the county clerk to see that the
    ballot boxes and envelopes were properly protected at all times except when
    they were actually being counted by the election commissioners and he must
    deliver the boxes to the election commissioners and see that they are properly
    locked and returned to his office when the commissioners have completed the
    count; the election commissioners may not employ guards to perform such duties
    of the clerk. Ewing v. Hays, 257 Ky. 259, 77 S.W.2d 946, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 553 (Ky. 1934) (decided

   <p class="p7">
    The fact that the sheriff is a candidate in the election
    does not disqualify him from acting as a member of the board of election commissioners,
    except that he shall have no voice in the decision of his own case. Potter v. Campbell, 155 Ky. 784, 160 S.W. 763, 1913 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 1913) (decided under prior
    law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where sheriff declined to act as member of board,
    under mistaken belief that his own candidacy disqualified him, the circuit
    clerk had no authority to act in his place, and where the Democratic member
    of the board was absent on account of illness the circuit clerk and the Republican
    member had no authority to canvass the returns or issue certificates; in such
    a case the members of the board could be compelled by mandatory injunction
    to convene and canvass the returns. Potter v. Campbell, 155 Ky. 784, 160 S.W. 763, 1913 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 1913) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where county sheriff was a candidate for office of
    jailer, it was improper for him to serve on board of election commissioners
    in canvassing returns. Scott v. Roberts, 255 Ky. 34, 72 S.W.2d 728, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 177 (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).

    certified by the board cannot compel the board by mandamus to reconvene and
    recount the ballots or change its decision as to whether certain ballots shall
    be counted or rejected; his only remedy is by contest. Houston v. Steele, 28 S.W. 662 (Ky. 1894) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The board of election commissioners cannot be compelled
    by mandamus to reconvene and change their decision on questioned ballots;
    the only way of attacking the decision of the board on questioned ballots
    is by contest proceeding. Booe v. Kenner, 105 Ky. 517, 49 S.W. 330, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 1343, 1899 Ky. LEXIS 240 (Ky. 1899) (decided under prior law).

    Where the election commissioners have erroneously

   <p class="p7">
    Where election commissioners had completed canvass
    of returns, a subsequent theft of the stub books for certain precincts would
    not require the vote in those precincts to be thrown out in a contest proceeding,
    notwithstanding that ballots had not been preserved in such a manner as to
    enable court to make a recount. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 Ky. 382, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 Ky. LEXIS 935 (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior law).

    Where ballot boxes of two precincts were stolen after
    count by election commissioners, the county clerk could have testified in
    a contest proceeding, from the information shown by the stub books in his
    possession, how many votes were cast in such precincts, without having introduced
    the stubs in evidence, for the purpose of showing that more than 20 per cent
    of total vote in particular race was cast in such precincts. Scott v. Roberts, 255 Ky. 34, 72 S.W.2d 728, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 177 (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).

    parol for the purpose of counting the vote. Scholl v. Bell, 125 Ky. 750, 102 S.W. 248, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 335, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 328 (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior law).

    Opening ballot box to remove pen of election clerk

    If it was shown that the ballot boxes had properly
    reached the hands of the county clerk and had remained in his custody, and
    that the boxes were apparently in the condition of preservation prescribed
    by former statute, there was a presumption, in a recount proceeding, that
    the integrity of the ballots had been maintained, but if there was evidence
    that the boxes had been tampered with, or that there had been an opportunity
    for tampering, the party seeking the recount had the burden of proving that
    there had actually been no tampering and that the ballots were the identical
    ones cast in the election. Edwards v. Logan, 114 Ky. 312, 70 S.W. 852, 75 S.W. 257, 24 Ky. L. Rptr. 1099, 25 Ky. L. Rptr. 435, 1902 Ky. LEXIS 164 (Ky. 1902) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fact that there were chisel marks on ballot box would
    not have prevented a recount, where box had been properly protected, the ballots
    appeared to be regular, and there was nothing to indicate that box had actually
    been opened. Morgan v. Sparkman, 143 Ky. 27, 135 S.W. 408, 1911 Ky. LEXIS 323 (Ky. 1911) (decided

    Where it was shown that ballot boxes were delivered
    to county clerk by proper officers, were kept in a locked room by the clerk,
    and in addition were soldered shut under the clerk’s direction, and there
    was no evidence of tampering or opportunity to tamper, the integrity of the
    ballots was sufficiently shown to justify including them in a recount. Potter v. Campbell, 159 Ky. 328, 167 S.W. 404, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 810 (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The party seeking a recount was not required to prove
    that it was not possible for the ballots to have been tampered with, but only
    that they had been so preserved that it was not reasonably probable that their
    integrity had been violated. Covington v. Joiner, 200 Ky. 378, 254 S.W. 1048, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 90 (Ky. 1923) (decided under prior law).

    Where election officers at primary held on Saturday
    were in doubt as to their duties concerning the ballot box, key and envelope,
    and therefore permitted one of their number to take the box, key and envelope
    to his home over the weekend, and such officer with an officer of the opposite
    party made delivery to the county clerk on Monday morning, such delay would
    not prevent the counting of the ballots where there was satisfactory proof
    that the integrity of the ballots had been preserved and the ballots tallied
    with the stubs. Raymer v. Willis, 240 Ky. 634, 42 S.W.2d 918, 1931 Ky. LEXIS 469 (Ky. 1931) (decided
    under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where evidence was that ballot boxes on being received
    by county clerk were placed in a securely-locked room, and properly guarded,
    the integrity of the ballots was sufficiently preserved to permit a recount
    by the court, although several of the boxes were not securely locked and contained
    papers, stencils and other material usable for tampering with the ballots,
    and although some of the individual boxes bore evidence of having been tampered
    with. In such case the court would consider the integrity of each box individually. Land v. Land, 244 Ky. 126, 50 S.W.2d 518, 1931 Ky. LEXIS 720 (Ky. 1931) (decided under prior
    law).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where there was no evidence of molestation or alteration

    outer office of the clerk, to which access during the day or night was easy,

    In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters. United States v. Risner, 737 Fed.

    Challengers may stay within the voting room while
    the vote is being polled, the election judges having no authority to eject
    them therefrom, and the challengers may exercise reasonable discretion in
    deciding where in the room they will post themselves, including withdrawing
    from the voting room when they feel it necessary. OAG 75-95.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In view of the fact that there is no official form
    for the designation of challengers and that there is no requirement that such
    appointments be notarized, a procedure whereby the challenger’s name and precinct
    is designated in writing and signed by the chairman of the county party complies
    with this section. OAG 76-702.

   <p class="p7">
    Aside from the regular election officers, a person
    must be designated a challenger at the polls in order for such person to challenge

    At least 25 percent of all the candidates of a particular
    party in the primary must combine and agree to recommend challengers in order

    There is no reason why challengers, designated in

   <p class="p7">
    The repair and maintenance of election machines are
    inevitable and necessary expenses and are thus characterized judicially as
    a cost of elections, which cost must be funded out of the county treasury
    directly as this section permits, or it could be funded by way of extending
    credit to the former county clerk against his excess fees for the calendar
    year in question. OAG 75-38.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Inasmuch as the state is only liable for its share
    of the expense of a special school tax election if the election is paid for
    by the county, the state would not be authorized to pay any portion of the
    election cost where the expense is paid by a citizens educational advisory
    committee. OAG 76-214.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Based on the fact that this section simply refers
    to “cost of the election,” in the absence of legislative restrictions
    all the expenses incurred in connection with the holding of an election must
    be included in determining such cost. OAG 76-421.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The statutory requirement pertaining to the printing
    of special ballots for absent voters, disabled voters and for voting in emergency
    situations constitutes an election expense to be paid for by the fiscal court
    pursuant to the terms of this section and such costs cannot be allowed as
    a necessary office expense of the county court clerk under KRS 64.345. OAG
    76-474.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since KRS 83A.050 requires cities to pay the cost
    of city elections only where the city election is held at a time other than
    the law prescribes for elections generally and since city officers can only
    be elected at general elections in November pursuant to Ky. Const., § 167
    and KRS 83A.040, which is the time prescribed for elections generally for
    all state and local offices, cities whose officers were elected in the 1981
    election would not be liable for any part of the election cost involved at
    the 1981 general election. OAG 82-167.

   <p class="p7">
    An essential requirement of a valid election is that
    the ballot shall be secret, and statutes necessary to effect that end are
    mandatory, but mere irregularities of election officers and voters, which
    do not affect the secrecy of the ballot, will not vitiate the election nor
    affect the validity of a vote. Marilla v. Ratterman, 209 Ky. 409, 273 S.W. 69, 1925 Ky. LEXIS 513 (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior law).

    Proof that a voter made statements after election

    The fact that voters subpoenaed by contestant did

    in which there are candidates from the Republican and Democrat parties as
    well as at least five independent candidates running for the unexpired term
    of sheriff, since the independent candidates did not indicate any independent
    party designation or symbol, together with the probability that there would
    not be enough columns on the voting machine to list each independent candidate
    in a separate column, it would appear to be less confusing to the voter to
    list the independents in a single column with instructions to vote for one.

    It is not a violation of a primary candidate’s constitutional
    right to secret ballot, as set out in Ky. Const., § 147, to require
    him to state under oath that he supported his parties’ nominees in the last
    regular election and will support the parties’ nominees in the next regular
    election before allowing him to register as a candidate in a primary election;
    the term “support,” as used in subsection (2) of this section,
    does not necessarily mean that the candidate must have voted the party ticket
    at the last regular election, but it could consist of advocating the claims
    of the party nominees, contributing to campaign expenses, getting out to vote
    or actual support in other ways. OAG 85-24.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where an individual changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican subsequent to the 1984 November election, he was disqualified from becoming a candidate in the May primary for either party; he could, however, change his registration back to that of Democrat and be qualified to seek nomination as a member of that party, or he could run as an independent. OAG 85-42.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A candidate is eligible to run in the 1993 primary if he changed his party affiliation after the November 1992 election, and then switched back to his original party affiliation before filing to run in the primary. OAG 93-8.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Failure to designate a campaign treasurer does not prevent a candidate’s name from appearing on the ballot, although it may have other adverse consequences, such as sanctions specified in KRS 121.990. OAG 2005-08.

    Candidates for Circuit Judge are permitted to run
    for nomination in the primary as candidates for both political parties as
    well as independents, but where a candidate running on both tickets in the
    primary was defeated, in order to run as an independent for Circuit Judge,
    he must have filed his petition not later than 55 days before the May primary,
    which was the same filing deadline for party nominees. OAG 75-424.

   <p class="p7">
    In an election to fill a vacancy on a city council,
    if the candidate was seeking a party nomination, his notification and declaration
    papers for the 1976 primary must have been filed no later than March 31, 1976.
    OAG 76-15.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Inasmuch as the notification requirements apply only
    to those candidates filing notification and declaration papers for a primary
    election, neither the Secretary of State nor the county clerk is required
    to notify independent candidates filing petitions for the November election.
    OAG 76-750.

    Where one of the electors executing the affidavit
    on behalf of a candidate changed his party affiliation subsequent to the last
    November election, he is disqualified as a qualified elector for the primary
    election, since he must not only have been affiliated with the candidate’s
    party at the last November election but must also remain so affiliated under
    KRS 116.055 and the candidate in question should withdraw his filing papers
    and execute one that complies with the statutory requirement since his papers
    are defective, but he may, upon notification under this section, correct such
    error not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline; otherwise his name
    shall not be placed on the ballot. OAG 81-126.

   <p class="p7">
    The 1984 amendment to this section eliminated the
    provision allowing a candidate to correct any error found on the face of the
    petition not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline. Thus, once the
    deadline for filing has lapsed, under KRS 118.365, the filing papers of the
    candidate cannot be changed or corrected. OAG 85-67.

    When a nominating paper is regular on its face, that
    is, properly filled out and duly notarized as required with respect to a candidate’s
    notification and declaration paper, the clerk has no choice but to place the
    name of the nominee on the ballot as requested by the nominating paper; he
    cannot question the qualification of the candidate or his signers or go behind
    the face of the certificate of nomination. OAG 85-67.

    The county clerk is not required to check the name

    The determination of this question is a matter for an opposing candidate or
    a qualified voter of the party to raise in circuit court pursuant to the provisions
    of KRS 118.176. OAG 85-67.

    The 120-day filing deadline established in this section
    and KRS 118.365 and 118A.060 was meant to uniformly apply to all filing deadlines,

    candidates seeking unexpired terms under the provisions of KRS 118.115, 118.375
    and 118A.100. OAG 89-5.

    To prevent a candidate’s name from appearing on the

    to this section by either an opposing candidate or a qualified voter. OAG
    74-676.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If the clerk conditionally accepts a petition pending
    a determination as to its compliance with the requirements of KRS 118.315,
    he may reject it when the petition is determined invalid; but if it was accepted
    unconditionally, it will be necessary for an opposing candidate or a qualified
    voter to bring a summary action in Circuit Court to prevent the proposed candidate’s
    name from appearing on the ballot. OAG 74-677.

    If a candidate’s filing papers are in order the county

    Where there was a question as to whether one of the

    particular magisterial district from which he was nominated, neither the fiscal
    court nor county board of elections nor any other county agency had any duty
    or authority to investigate or intervene in the matter of the candidate’s
    residence; however, if the candidate had been elected and assumed office without
    possessing the residential qualifications as required by the Kentucky Constitution
    he would have been subject to removal as a usurper by the Commonwealth’s attorney
    under the terms of KRS Chapter 415. OAG 77-513.

    Where a candidate’s petition contained only 18 valid
    signatures following the deduction of those who had previously signed an opposing
    candidate’s petition, the petition did not qualify under the terms of KRS 83A.170 requiring a minimum of 20 petitioners. However, where the petition
    was not challenged either by an opponent or a qualified voter in court pursuant
    to this section before the primary, nor was the clerk requested, before the
    primary, to check the signatures against the registration record of signers,
    and the candidate was, as a consequence, nominated for office, the filing
    papers could not be challenged after the nomination and before the election.
    OAG 82-512.

   <p class="p7">
    If a candidate for a municipal office does in fact
    move out of the city prior to his election, the question of disqualifying
    him by having his name removed from the ballot is a matter that must be determined
    by a Circuit Court action brought by an opposing candidate under the terms
    of this section; if such action is not brought at that time, his qualifications
    cannot be attacked after the election in a contest suit. On the other hand,
    if he is not a legal resident when he enters office, he becomes a usurper
    subject to removal by the Attorney General under the usurpation statute, particularly
    KRS 415.050. OAG 84-12.

    a qualified voter of the party to raise in Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions
    of this section. OAG 85-67.

    Where a number of candidates desire to run as an independent

    therefore, since the requirement of subsection (2) of this section that the
    petitioner state his Social Security account number when signing a petition
    on behalf of an independent candidate was inserted by amendment in 1982, it
    must be construed as directory only. Thus being directory, the fact that the
    petitioner does not indicate his Social Security account number will not affect
    the validity of his signature in ascertaining the required number of petitioners
    necessary to establish the fact that the candidate has complied with the filing
    requirements of this section. OAG 83-437.

    regular election as a candidate for the same office is constitutional. However,
    such a person may be voted for by “write-in” votes. Mullins v. Jackson, 270 Ky. 149, 109 S.W.2d 387, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 36 (Ky. 1937). See Keen v. Revis, 270 Ky. 223, 109 S.W.2d 609, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 58 (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).

    This section, the so-called “sore-loser”
    provision, does not apply to presidential candidates, since a candidate cannot
    lose his party’s nomination for president by losing the state’s primary election
    and since the legislature made no attempt by amendment to accommodate the
    presidential preference primary. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. Ky. 1981).

    Injunctive relief would not be granted to a presidential
    candidate who sought to have his name stricken from the ballot of a presidential
    primary election, where the presidential candidate, who had been running as
    a Republican at the time the board of elections nominated him to appear on
    the primary ballot but who decided to seek the presidency as an independent,
    did not give written notice of the withdrawal of his candidacy until after
    the Secretary of State’s certification of the primary ballot. Anderson v. Mills, 491 F. Supp. 1231, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13620 (E.D. Ky. 1980).

    election ballot as an independent candidate. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. Ky. 1981).

    Candidate who was defeated in Democratic primary
    could not be nominated to fill vacancy in Republican candidacy and where a
    candidate was so nominated and was placed on the ballot as the candidate of
    the Republican party, the proof of such fact in a contest proceeding would
    be sufficient to deprive such candidate of the election. Francis v. Sturgill, 163 Ky. 650, 174 S.W. 753, 1915 Ky. LEXIS 318 (Ky. 1915), limited, Napier v. Roberts, 172 Ky. 227, 189 S.W. 206, 1916 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 1916) (decided under prior law).

    A judicial candidate running as an “independent”
    can be designated on the November ballot only as “independent”
    without adding any emblem, device or slogan. OAG 75-185.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section does not prevent a candidate defeated
    in the primary from running for a different office if he is permitted to file
    for said office after the primary, such as for a municipal or school board
    office. OAG 75-424.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a candidate who has been defeated for nomination
    in the May primary could not have his name placed on the voting machine in
    the succeeding November election as a candidate for the same office, he could
    run as a “write-in” candidate for any office in November. OAG
    77-368; OAG 77-484.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a candidate’s party nomination at the primary
    was subsequently declared void by virtue of his violation of a section of
    the Corrupt Practices Act, the candidate could not be nominated by the party
    to have his name placed on the November ballot to fill the vacancy. OAG 77-388.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a candidate for magistrate who was defeated
    in the primary could not have his name placed on the November ballot for the
    office of magistrate, he would be eligible to have his name placed on the
    ballot for any other office for which he could file an independent petition.

   <p class="p7">
    A candidate defeated in the primary may run as a “write-in”
    candidate for the same office in November, even though this section prohibits
    a defeated candidate from having his name placed on the ballot in the November
    election, since he has a constitutional right to run as a “write-in”
    candidate. OAG 81-289.

    Defeated candidates in the Republican primary for
    statewide offices can run as an independent group for offices for which they

    with a symbol or device to represent said independent party. OAG 83-279.

   <p class="p7">
    This section clearly prohibits candidates defeated

    There is no reasonable, natural or logical basis for

    Upon review of this section as a whole, it would

    an election campaign and every undertaking attendant thereto is for the influencing
    of voters. The idea that candidates may solicit campaign funds and expend
    money to enhance the likelihood of their election, and at the same time be
    prohibited from spending money or things of value with the intent to influence
    voters is inherently contradictory. Commonwealth v. Foley, 798 S.W.2d 947, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 121 (Ky. 1990), overruled in part, Martin v. Commonwealth, 96 S.W.3d 38, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 2003).

    In a criminal trial in which two defendants were convicted of conspiracy to buy votes and vote buying in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 371 and 1973i(c), the district court did not err in giving a willful blindness jury instruction because there was sufficient evidence that both defendants consciously avoided knowledge of wrongdoing; the district court correctly denied one defendant’s request for a vote hauling instruction because defendant provided no case law to support the theory that transporting voters to the polls pursuant to KRS 119.205(5) included escorting them to the polls, watching them vote, and then escorting them back to another location. United States v. Young, 516 Fed. Appx. 599, 2013 FED App. 0236N, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 4782 (6th Cir. Ky. 2013).

    for nomination to office at a primary election held under the provisions of
    KRS 118.015 to 118.035 and 118.105 to 118.255, or any candidate for nomination
    to a city office at a primary election for which the statutes do not otherwise
    provide for determining contest elections, for whom a number of votes was
    cast equal to not less than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast for the
    successful candidate or slate of candidates for nomination to the office,
    may contest the right of the successful candidate or slate of candidates,
    and of any other candidate or slate of candidates for nomination to the office,
    to the nomination, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court within ten (10)
    days from the day of the primary election, stating the specific grounds relied
    upon for the contest, and causing a summons to be issued, returnable in seven
    (7) days. In the case of candidates or slates of candidates for offices for
    the state at large, the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court;
    in the case of other candidates it shall be filed in the Circuit Court of
    the county in which the contestee resides. The summons may be personally served
    on the contestee in any county, or it may be served by leaving a copy at his
    home with a member of his family over sixteen (16) years of age, or by posting
    a copy on the door of his residence. The contestee shall file his answer within
    seven (7) days after service of summons. The answer may contain grounds of
    contest in favor of the contestee and against the contestant, but the grounds
    shall be specifically set out. Any candidate or slate of candidates who would
    have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a
    party to a recount proceeding brought under KRS 120.095, may, by filing an
    answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for
    filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner
    in the recount proceeding. No ground of contest by either party shall be filed
    or made more definite by amendment after the expiration of the time allowed
    by this section for filing the original pleading. The contestant may file
    a reply within five (5) days after answer is filed, which shall complete the
    pleading, and any affirmative matter in the reply shall be treated as controverted.
    Upon return of the summons, properly executed, to the office of the circuit
    clerk of the county in which the action is pending, the clerk shall immediately
    docket the cause and notify the presiding judge of the court that the contest
    has been instituted, and the judge shall proceed to a trial of the cause within
    five (5) days after the issue was joined. In judicial circuits having more
    than one (1) Circuit Judge, the judge who shall hear the cause shall be determined
    by lot.

    Any candidate for nomination to office at a primary held under the provisions of KRS 118.015 to 118.035 and 118.105 to 118.255, or any candidate for nomination to a city office at a primary for which the statutes do not otherwise provide for determining contest elections, for whom a number of votes was cast equal to not less than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast for the successful candidate for nomination to the office, may contest the right of the successful candidate, and of any other candidate for nomination to the office, to the nomination, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court within ten (10) days from the day of the primary, stating the specific grounds relied upon for the contest, and causing a summons to be issued, returnable in seven (7) days. In the case of candidates for offices for the state at large, the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court; in the case of other candidates it shall be filed in the Circuit Court of the county in which the contestee resides. The summons may be personally served on the contestee in any county, or it may be served by leaving a copy at his or her home with a member of his or her family over sixteen (16) years of age, or by posting a copy on the door of his or her residence. The contestee shall file his or her answer within seven (7) days after service of summons. The answer may contain grounds of contest in favor of the contestee and against the contestant, but the grounds shall be specifically set out. Any candidate who would have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a party to a recount proceeding brought under KRS 120.095, may, by filing an answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner in the recount proceeding. No ground of contest by either party shall be filed or made more definite by amendment after the expiration of the time allowed by this section for filing the original pleading. The contestant may file a reply within five (5) days after answer is filed, which shall complete the pleading, and any affirmative matter in the reply shall be treated as controverted. Upon return of the summons, properly executed, to the office of the circuit clerk of the county in which the action is pending, the clerk shall immediately docket the cause and notify the presiding judge of the court that the contest has been instituted, and the judge shall proceed to a trial of the cause within five (5) days after the issue was joined. In judicial circuits having more than one (1) Circuit Judge, the judge who shall hear the cause shall be determined by lot.

    Each party to a contest instituted
    under KRS 120.055 shall be entitled, in the production of evidence to be used
    on the trial thereof, to all the remedies allowed in cases at law and in equity.
    In trying the contest the court shall hear and determine all questions of
    law and fact without the intervention of a jury, and may examine the witnesses
    orally or require or permit the parties to take the evidence by depositions.
    If the evidence is taken orally either party may require it to be taken by

    for as evidence in other civil actions. The court may require the contestant,
    or the person who has the burden of proof under the issue joined, to complete
    his proof in not less than fifteen (15) days after service of summons, and
    the contestee, or the person not having the burden, to complete his proof
    in not less than ten (10) days after filing an answer. Each party may be given
    one (1) day additional for producing evidence in rebuttal and no greater time
    shall be extended, unless the court is satisfied that the ends of justice
    demand it. The court shall, immediately after the evidence is concluded, consider
    the contest and determine it. If it appears from an inspection of the whole
    record that there has been such fraud, intimidation, bribery or violence in
    the conduct of the election that neither contestant nor contestee can be adjudged
    to have been fairly nominated, the court may adjudge that there has been no
    election, in which event the nomination shall be deemed vacant. The judgment
    of the court shall be filed in the office of the Circuit Court clerk.

    or “forthwith,” but rather meant “without unnecessary delay,”
    or “with due diligence under the circumstances.” The limitation
    of ten days for an appeal from a recount judgment indicated that the general
    assembly considered ten days a reasonable time. Austin v. Anderson, 279 Ky. 742, 132 S.W.2d 56, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 345 (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior law).

    Any candidate voted for at a primary held under KRS 118.015 to 118.035 and 118.105 to 118.255 may request a recount of the ballots by filing a petition with the same court that contest petitions are required to be filed with, within ten (10) days after the day of the primary, or, if the candidate is qualified to bring a contest proceeding under KRS 120.055, by including a request for a recount in his or her petition instituting the contest proceedings. Any candidate who is a contestee in a contest proceeding under KRS 120.055 may request a recount in his or her answer filed in the contest proceeding, but in that case the answer shall be filed within five (5) days after the service of process on the petition. When a request for a recount is made, the State Board of Elections or the county board of elections, whichever would issue the certificate of nomination, shall be made a party defendant. The party requesting the recount shall execute a bond with approved surety for the costs of the recount, in an amount to be fixed by the Circuit Judge. Upon the bond being filed, the clerk shall immediately notify the Circuit Judge of the request and the filing of the bond, and the judge shall at once enter an order directing custody of the voting machines, the ballots, boxes, and all papers pertaining to the election to be transferred to the Circuit Court, and fix a day for the recount proceedings to begin. A copy of the order shall be served upon the parties or their counsel in the same manner as notices are required to be served, which shall be deemed sufficient notice of the proceeding. On the day fixed, the court shall proceed to recount the ballots if their integrity is satisfactorily shown and shall complete the recount as soon as practicable, and file and enter of record the results thereof, and direct the state board or county board, whichever would issue the certificate of nomination, to issue a certificate to the party entitled thereto as shown by the recount.

    Any candidate for election to any state, county, district or city office (except the office of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, member of the General Assembly, and those city offices as to which there are other provisions made by law for determining contest elections), for whom a number of votes was cast equal to not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of votes cast for the successful candidate for the office, may contest the election of the successful candidate, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court of the county where the contestee resides, unless the officer is one (1) elected by the voters of the whole state, in which case the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court. The petition shall be filed and process issued within thirty (30) days after the day of election; it shall state the grounds of the contest relied on, and no other grounds shall afterwards be relied upon. The contestee shall file an answer within twenty (20) days after the service of summons upon him. The answer may consist of a denial of the averments of the petition and may also set up grounds of contest against the contestant; if grounds are so set up they shall be specifically pointed out and none other shall thereafter be relied upon by the party. Any candidate who would have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a party to a recount proceeding under KRS 120.185, may, by filing answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner in the recount proceeding. A reply may be filed within ten (10) days after the answer is filed; its affirmative allegations shall be treated as controverted, and no subsequent pleading shall be allowed.

    they have been tampered with, or that access has been afforded to them to
    unauthorized persons, the burden shifts, and the person seeking the recount
    must then prove affirmatively that the ballots are the identical ones cast,

    out of the state. The depositions shall be sealed up by the officer taking
    them, and directed to the clerk of the Senate or clerk of the House, as the
    case may require. The depositions properly taken shall be read as evidence
    before the board or branch of the General Assembly having jurisdiction of
    the case, and the board or branch may call for and hear other proof. The taking
    of depositions to be used before a board or branch of the General Assembly

     Board
     for determining contest of election of Governor or Lieutenant Governor.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    When the election of a Governor
    or Lieutenant Governor is contested, a board for determining the contest shall
    be formed and shall proceed in the following manner:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    On
    the third day after the organization of the General Assembly that meets next
    after the election, the Senate shall select three (3) of its members, and
    the House of Representatives shall select eight (8) of its members, and the
    eleven (11) so selected shall constitute a board to try the contest, seven
    (7) of whom shall constitute a quorum. In making the selection, the name of
    each member present shall be written on a separate piece of paper, every piece
    being as nearly similar to the other as possible. Each piece shall be rolled
    up so that the names thereon cannot be seen nor any particular piece ascertained
    or selected by feeling. The whole, so prepared, shall be placed by the clerk
    in a box on his table, and after it has been well shaken and the papers therein
    well intermixed the clerk shall draw out one (1) paper, which shall be opened
    and read aloud by the presiding officer, and so on until the required number
    is obtained. If any person so selected swears that he cannot, without great
    personal inconvenience, serve on the board, or that he feels an undue bias
    for or against either of the parties, he may be excused by the house from
    which he was chosen from serving on the board, and if it appears that a person
    so selected is related to either party, or is liable to any other proper objection
    on the score of his partiality, he shall be excused. Any deficiency in the
    proper number so created shall be supplied by another draw from the box. The
    members of the board so chosen shall be sworn by the Speaker of the House
    of Representatives to try the contested election, and give true judgment thereon
    according to the evidence unless dissolved before rendering judgment.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The
    board shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after its selection, meet, appoint
    its chairman, and assign a day for hearing the contest, and may adjourn from
    day to day as its business requires. If any member of the board willfully
    fails to attend its sessions he shall be reported to the house to which he
    belongs, and that house shall thereupon, in its discretion, punish him by
    fine or imprisonment, or both.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    The
    board may send for persons, papers and records and issue attachments therefor
    signed by its chairman or clerk, and may issue commissions for taking proof.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    If
    it appears that the candidates receiving the highest number of votes given
    have received an equal number, the right to the office shall be determined
    by lot, under the direction of the board. If the person returned is found
    not to have been legally qualified to receive the office at the time of his
    election, and the first two (2) years of his term have not expired, a new
    election shall be ordered to fill the vacancy. If a person other than the
    one returned is found to have received the highest number of legal votes given,
    he shall be adjudged to be the person elected and entitled to the office.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    No
    decision shall be made but by the vote of six (6) members of the board. The
    decision of the board shall not be final nor conclusive, but shall be reported
    to the two (2) houses of the General Assembly, in joint session, for the further
    action of the General Assembly. The Speaker of the House shall preside at
    the joint session, and the General Assembly shall then determine the contest.
    If no decision of the board is given during the then session of the General
    Assembly, it shall be dissolved, unless by joint resolution of the two (2)
    houses it is empowered to continue longer.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    If
    a new election is required, it shall be immediately ordered by proclamation
    of the Speaker of the House, to take place on a day not less than thirty (30)
    days nor more than six (6) weeks thereafter.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)
    </span>
    When
    a new election is ordered or the incumbent is adjudged not to be entitled
    to the office, his power shall immediately cease, and if the office is not
    adjudged to another it shall be deemed to be vacant.

    votes, the exclusion of legal votes, the unfair or illegal conduct of the
    election, tampering with the returns, the alteration of the certificates of
    the results, bribery, fraud, intimidation or corrupt practices, or any conduct

    five (5) days after the petition is filed, determine whether there are sufficient

    The city’s challenge to an election, that voters submitted a possibly untruthful affidavit in order to be allowed to vote on an annexation question, fell squarely within the purview of KRS 120.250(1).

    The legislative intent of the Kentucky Corrupt Practices

    process, and to equalize the relative ability of all voters to affect the
    outcome of elections. Lee v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.2d 634, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 511 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).

   <p class="p7">
    The definition of “contribution” is not
    unconstitutionally overbroad; the law regulates the amount of contributions
    when the slate of candidates elects to receive public financing, thus requiring
    the candidates to obtain funding from a greater number of sources, and the
    overall effect of the limitation on contributions is merely to require candidates
    and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons and
    to compel people who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory
    limits to expend such funds on direct political expression, rather than to
    reduce the total amount of money potentially available to promote political
    expression. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    The definition of “knowingly” as applied
    to the defendants was constitutional as they were experienced political operatives
    who knew that their campaign had elected to receive state funding and were
    certainly not novices in the political arena and, therefore, they could determine
    with reasonable certainty whether their actions were illegal. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

   <p class="p7">
    The mens rea element of “aware
    or should have been aware” in KRS 121.015(10) suffices to support a
    criminal conviction under KRS 121.990(3) because it requires defendants to
    have sufficient knowledge of the nature of their conduct so as not to deny
    them their due process and First Amendment rights. Martin v. Commonwealth, 96 S.W.3d 38, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky.), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 928, 123 S. Ct. 2586, 156 L. Ed. 2d 605, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 4633 (U.S. 2003).

   <p class="p7">
    Since the election finance act refers to and applies
    only to elections involving public questions, concerning which committees
    for or against have been formed, and certain candidates for public office,
    political action committees advocating or opposing public questions that are
    not subject to referendum would not be governed by the election finance act.
    OAG 75-546.

   <p class="p7">
    Under the definition of the term “election,”
    which means any primary, regular or special election, a person could contribute
    up to $3,000 to a particular candidate for use in his primary election campaign
    and a sum equal to this amount for use in his general election campaign. OAG
    75-590.

   <p class="p7">
    Since announcement for a public office is not made
    until after January 1 in the calendar year of the election, while election
    officers for precincts are selected by the previous September 20 in the preceding
    calendar year, members of the county board of elections would be entitled
    to perform their duties, including the selection of election officers on or
    before September 20 as prescribed in KRS 117.045 through the year preceding
    the candidacy for public office, unless, prior to such election, they become
    candidates under any of the conditions set forth in the definition of candidates

    Upon
    the sworn complaint of any person, or on its own initiative, the registry
    shall investigate alleged violations of campaign finance law. In conducting
    any investigation, the registry shall have the power of subpoena and may compel
    production of evidence including the financial records of any person determined
    by the registry to be vital to the investigation. The records subject to subpoena
    include, but are not limited to, a person’s bank records and other relevant
    documents, but excluding individual and business income tax records.

    <span class="boldspan">

    If
    the registry concludes that there is probable cause to believe that the law
    has been violated, the registry shall notify the alleged violator of its conclusions
    and the evidence supporting them, and shall offer the alleged violator a conciliation
    agreement to resolve the issue. A conciliation agreement may require the alleged
    violator to comply with one (1) or more of the following:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)

    a civil action in Franklin Circuit Court or the Circuit Court for the county
    of the violator’s residence to enforce the provisions of any conciliation
    agreement accepted by a violator who is not complying with its provisions.
   </li>

    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)

    If
    the alleged violator declines to accept the conciliation agreement or fails
    to respond within the time allowed, the registry shall submit a written request
    to the Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court to recommend not fewer
    than five (5) nor more than ten (10) retired or former justices or retired
    or former judges of the Court of Justice who are qualified and willing to
    conduct a hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. Upon receipt of
    the recommendations of the Chief Justice, the registry shall randomly select
    one (1) retired or former justice or judge from the list to conduct the hearing,
    which shall be held in accordance with the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure,
    or, if the Chief Justice declines to make recommendations, the registry, on
    its own initiative, shall request retired or former justices or judges to
    serve. The time and location of hearings shall be determined by the registry.
    Retired or former justices or judges selected to serve shall receive reimbursement
    from the registry for their reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as
    a result of the performance of their duties at the hourly rate set for attorneys
    by the Finance and Administration Cabinet. The registry shall notify the complainant
    and the alleged violator that a hearing shall be conducted of the specific
    offenses alleged not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing.
    At the hearing, which shall be open to the public pursuant to KRS 61.810,
    the attorney for the registry shall present the evidence against the alleged
    violator, and the alleged violator shall have all of the protections of due
    process, including, but not limited to, the right to be represented by counsel,
    the right to call and examine witnesses, the right to the production of evidence
    by subpoena, the right to introduce exhibits and the right to cross-examine
    opposing witnesses. If the justice or judge determines that the preponderance
    of the evidence shows a violation has occurred, the justice or judge shall
    render a decision not more than sixty (60) days after the case is submitted
    for determination. The decision shall become the final decision of the registry
    unless the registry board at its next regular meeting acts to set aside or
    modify the justice’s or judge’s decision, in which case the registry board’s
    decision shall become the final registry decision. A party adversely affected
    by the registry’s order may appeal to Franklin Circuit Court within thirty
    (30) days after the date of the registry’s order. The violator may be ordered
    to comply with any one (1) or more of the following requirements:

    Attorney General or the appropriate Commonwealth’s or county attorney for
    prosecution. The Attorney General may request the registry’s attorney or the
    appropriate county or Commonwealth’s attorney to prosecute the matter and
    may request from the registry all evidence collected in its investigation.
    In the event the Attorney General or the appropriate local prosecutor fails
    to prosecute in a timely fashion, the registry may petition the Circuit Court
    to appoint the registry’s attorney to prosecute, and upon a motion timely
    filed, for good cause shown, the court shall enter an order to that effect.
    Prosecutions involving campaign finance law violations, in which the reports
    are required to be filed in Frankfort, may be conducted in Franklin Circuit
    Court or in the Circuit Court for the county in which the contribution or
    expenditure constituting a campaign finance violation was solicited, made,
    or accepted. The prosecution of a person who unlawfully solicits, makes, or
    accepts a contribution or expenditure through the use of the mail may be conducted
    in the Circuit Court for the county in which the solicitation is mailed, the

    The Campaign Finance Law’s distinction between permanent
    committees and political candidates does not render it unconstitutional. The
    disparate treatment reflects an analogous legislative determination that aggregate
    limitations are necessary to prevent manipulation of permanent committees
    in order to evade the Law’s $1,000 limitation of direct contributions to any
    one political candidate. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).

    The $1,000 limitation of subsection (6) of this section
    and KRS 121A.050(1) on direct contributions in connections with state and
    local elections is not different in kind from the $1,000 limitation on direct
    contributions in connection with federal elections, and plaintiffs’ First
    Amendment challenge to the limitation was rejected. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).

   <p class="p7">
    The $1,500 limit of subsection (10) of this section
    furthers the goal of preventing corruption in Kentucky politics by avoiding
    evasion of the individual contribution limitations. This goal of combating
    corruption, combined with the limited protection afforded this type of speech,
    compels the conclusion that subsection (10) is constitutional. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The definition of “independent expenditure”
    does not impinge on constitutionally protected activity as it does not prohibit
    individuals or organizations from communicating with a campaign, but rather
    attempts to prevent circumvention of the restriction on contributions after
    a slate elects to accept state funds for running its campaign. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

    Commonwealth of Kentucky’s

    they cease to be personally financially vulnerable and therefore do not appear
    to be easy targets for corrupt contributors. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. Ky. 1995).

    Absent this aggregate limit, unscrupulous individuals could pass unlimited

   <p class="p7">
    The contribution limits of election financing laws
    target the size of contributions, presumably based upon the theory that the
    smaller the contribution the less coercive it will be. The provision governing
    the timing of contributions diminishes the appearance that contributions that
    are made by supporters after the election foster a quid pro quo relationship.
    While post-election contributions may in actuality reimburse a candidate for
    loans made to the campaign, there is an impression that the contributor is
    lining the candidate’s pocket, as there is no ongoing campaign to which the
    contribution may be made. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. Ky. 1995).

    The requirement that campaign advertising and literature

    and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution obviates the need

    The identification provisions of subsection (1) of
    this section that campaign communications contain the language “paid
    for by” is narrowly tailored to meet the compelling state requirements
    of providing the electorate with sufficient information as to where campaign
    money is from and how it is spent, deterring actual corruption and the appearance
    of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light
    of publicity and recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure to gather data necessary
    to detect violations of the contribution limitations inasmuch as they only
    require the identification of the payor. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. Ky. 1995).

    The identification disclaimer for independent expenditures
    contained in subsection (1) of this section is narrowly tailored toward achieving
    the goals of preventing actual and perceived corruption by immediately notifying
    the public of any possible allegiance a particular candidate may feel toward
    the publisher, and provides the registry with a method of detecting those
    expenditures which are not truly independent by providing a paper trial to
    detect violations by unscrupulous PACs routing expenditures through individuals.
    Therefore, plaintiffs First Amendment challenge to subsection (1) was rejected. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).

    A handbill or sample ballot prepared by a printer
