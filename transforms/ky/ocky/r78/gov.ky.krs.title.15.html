    Subdivision (9) of this section explicitly provides that the turnpike authority may designate the locations and establish, limit and control such points of ingress to and egress from each turnpike project “as the authority and the bureau (department of highways) may determine to be necessary.” It is obvious that subdivision (9) was designed to utilize the best thinking and planning of the turnpike authority and the administrative and technical engineering talent of the department of highways; thus, a view that the turnpike authority enjoys a basic autonomy in this context is incorrect and unrealistic. OAG 83-118.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under subdivision (9) of this section, the turnpike authority, acting in concert with the department of highways, has the authority to grant additional access points on a turnpike. However, such a decision, as a sound exercise of discretion, must be on a case-by-case basis, and be based upon the general public’s best interest in terms of peace, health, safety, convenience, and general and economic welfare; such a decision for additional access points must be subject to available funding of construction and maintenance, and must in no way compromise or lessen in any way the rights of bondholders involved in the original turnpike construction.

   <li class="p9">
    The authority and the department are authorized and empowered to enter into a lease or leases with respect to any turnpike project or projects pursuant to any agreement or agreements made under the provisions of KRS 175.460. Any lease may contain, in substance, any of the provisions set forth in this section and such other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the authority and the department may deem appropriate and desirable:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    That the lease is for the remainder of the biennial period in which it is dated and executed, and is renewable at the option of the department for the succeeding biennial period, one (1) at a time, until the final maturity date of the bond issue to which the lease is related;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    That as to the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project, and not otherwise, the department is contractually bound not only for the remainder of the biennial period in which the lease is dated and executed, but for the entire period of years until the final maturity of such bonds;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    That with respect to the biennial period in which the lease is dated and executed, the department shall otherwise be firmly bound only (a) to contribute to the authority such portions, if any, of the cost of the project as the agreement prescribes shall be paid by the department, and (b) to pay to the authority the rental prescribed for such biennium;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    That if the department shall fully perform all such obligations during such initial term of the lease, it shall have an exclusive option to renew the lease at the time and in the manner prescribed for the ensuing biennium, effective on the first day thereof; that the department shall not be or become in any way obligated to pay the rental stipulated for such biennium unless the lease be so renewed; and that the department shall, upon any such renewal, be firmly bound to pay to the authority the rental stipulated for such biennium as a general obligation of the department to be paid not only from the revenues of the project but also from any other available funds of the department not required by law or by previous binding contract to be devoted to some other purpose;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    In like manner and subject to the same conditions and provisions as are set forth in subsection (4) above, if the department shall in such first ensuing biennium fully perform all its obligations and pay to the authority the rental stipulated for such biennium, the department shall have another exclusive option to renew such lease for another biennium; and so on for successive biennial terms until the final biennium for which the lease may be renewed;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    That each such option of the department to renew the lease for a succeeding biennial term may be exercised at any time after the adjournment of the session of the General Assembly at which appropriations shall have been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding biennial term, by so notifying the authority in writing signed by the commissioner of highways and delivered in the office of the authority to any officer thereof; provided, however, that such option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day thereof, unless a written notice of the department’s election not to renew shall have been delivered in the office of the authority, to an officer thereof, before the close of business on the last working day in April immediately preceding the beginning of such succeeding biennium;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)
    </span>
    That so long as the lease is renewed from time to time and the department fully performs all its obligations as lessee, including payment of the rental stipulated in the lease, (a) the revenues of the project shall be collected, segregated, distributed, deposited, secured, disbursed and accounted for in strict conformity with the proceedings and trust indenture of the authority, and the aggregate of such revenues properly accounted for and deposited pursuant to said proceedings and trust indenture shall, if and to the extent provided in the lease, be a credit against the department’s rental or other obligations for the then current biennial term under the lease, and (b) any motor fuel taxes and surtaxes collected by the Commonwealth on gasoline and other motor fuels consumed on the project and set aside pursuant to an agreement shall be applied as provided in said proceedings and trust indenture and shall, if and to the extent provided in the lease, be a credit against the department’s rental or other obligations for the then current biennial term under the lease; and if such revenues and motor fuel taxes so provided in the lease to be a credit against the rental or other obligations of the department under the lease shall at any time appear to be insufficient to discharge such obligations in full when due and payable, the department shall estimate the rate of deficiency on a semiannual basis conforming to the interest payment dates of the bonds of the authority to which the lease is related and shall pay the amount of such estimated deficiency to the authority in equal monthly payments from any other available funds of the department not required by law or previous binding contract to be devoted to other purposes, subject to adjustment from estimated deficiencies to actual deficiencies at least thirty (30) days before each such semiannual interest payment date; provided, however, that during the department’s continuance in good standing in this respect the department shall have the right to establish, increase, decrease, suspend, or abolish the exaction of tolls, rates and charges for vehicular travel upon the project, but during any period when the department may elect to suspend or abolish the exaction of such tolls, rates and charges, it shall nevertheless continue to maintain in good operating condition, on a stand-by basis, all tollhouses, tollgates, toll-registering and toll-collecting equipment, signs, lights, fences, and other installations and facilities incident to, or used or useful in connection with, the exaction and collection of tolls, rates, and charges, in order that the same may be resumed at any time, without delay;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (8)
    </span>
    That in the event the lease is not renewed in accordance with its terms, or in the event it is renewed and the department shall fail to perform in full its obligations thereunder, then (a) the department shall immediately be liable for the balance of the rental stipulated for the then current biennial term for which the lease had previously been renewed, without requirement of notice or other action on the part of the authority, and shall forthwith pay such balance to the authority upon demand, (b) the department shall forfeit its then current option to renew the lease for the ensuing biennial term and its options for all future terms, (c) the right to establish, increase, decrease, suspend, abolish the exaction of, or resume tolls, rates, and charges for vehicular travel on the project shall wholly pass from the department to the authority, and (d) all motor fuel taxes collected by the Commonwealth on gasoline and other motor fuels consumed on the project, except the two-sevenths (2/7) of said motor fuel taxes provided by KRS 138.220 to be set aside for the construction, reconstruction, and maintenance of rural and secondary roads, shall thereafter be set aside and paid over to the authority as revenues of the project for deposit in the sinking fund or funds pledged to the payment of the bonds of the authority; and

    <span class="boldspan">
     (9)

    In the event of the department’s forfeiture of rights as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the same may not be reassumed, nor the department restored to good standing with options to renew the lease from time to time, except in such manner as shall not be inconsistent with the rights of the holders of outstanding bonds.

    The authority is authorized to provide, at one (1) time or from time to time, for the issuance of its turnpike revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one (1) or more turnpike projects undertaken pursuant to an agreement and lease. The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided for the payment. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate or rates or method of determining rates, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile of the seal shall be affixed to the bonds and attested by the manual signature of the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery of the bonds. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell the bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the turnpike project or projects for which the bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in a manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for the bonds or any account or accounts as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing the bonds.

The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things, except as specifically required by this chapter.

     Debt payment acceleration fund — Revenue source — Use to accelerate payment of turnpike authority debt.

   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    There is hereby created a fund in the road fund of the Commonwealth of Kentucky entitled the debt payment acceleration fund. The fund shall consist of twenty percent (20%) of the revenues to the state road fund provided by the adjustments in KRS 138.220(2) excluding the provisions of KRS 177.320 and 177.365. Annually the Transportation Cabinet shall use the funds generated to accelerate the payment of debt service including principal and interest, over and above the annual debt service payments appropriated for each fiscal year, for all bonds issued and any refinancings thereof by the Kentucky Turnpike Authority. The Transportation Cabinet shall notify the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue by January 1 of each fiscal year of the debt payments which are to or have been accelerated in the fiscal year. In the event that, due to bond market conditions, the terms of the bonds issued or other factors, the Transportation Cabinet is unable to accelerate debt service payments, the Transportation Cabinet shall provide documentation to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue that such acceleration is not possible and the reasons therefor. In such an event, the funds not available for debt acceleration shall be placed in a special escrow account in the Transportation Cabinet. Such funds shall not be expended for any of the lawful purposes of the Transportation Cabinet but shall be held in the escrow account until such time as the debt acceleration described by this section is possible. The Transportation Cabinet shall invest the funds allocated to the escrow account and any funds generated from these investments shall remain in the escrow account. Any funds remaining in the escrow account at the close of the fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year for use as provided in this section. In the event that all principal and interest outstanding on any bonds issued or any refinancing thereof by the turnpike authority has been paid, the Transportation Cabinet shall so report. In that event, any funds remaining in the escrow account shall remain in the fund until such time as the funds are appropriated by the General Assembly for any of the lawful purposes of the Transportation Cabinet.

     Trust indenture to secure bonds — Rights and remedies of bondholders.

   <li class="p9">
    In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture or the proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any turnpike project or any part thereof. Such trust indenture or proceedings may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the turnpike project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates of toll or the rentals to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust indenture or proceedings may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the turnpike project or projects.

Prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings for such easement over or under such railroad property or right of way, plans and specifications of the proposed project showing compliance with the above mentioned above or below grade requirements and showing sufficient and safe plans and specifications of such overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be submitted to the railroad for examination and approval. If the railroad fails or refuses within thirty (30) days to approve the plans and specifications so submitted, the matter shall be submitted to the Public Service Commission of Kentucky whose decision arrived at after due consideration in accordance with its usual procedure, shall be final as to the sufficiency and safety of such plans and specifications and as to such elevations or distances above or below the tracks. Said overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be constructed only in accordance with such plans and specifications and in accordance with such elevations or distances above or below the tracks so approved by the railroad or the Public Service Commission as the case may be. A copy of the plans and specifications approved by the railroad or the Public Service Commission shall be filed as an exhibit with the petition for condemnation.

   <li class="p9">
    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky determines as a legislative finding of fact that the economy of the Commonwealth is, to a major degree, dependent upon the severance and production of coal, which is the most abundant and valuable mineral resource of Kentucky; that there is a serious shortage of transportation facilities for the transportation of coal from mines to market; that many of the roads, bridges and highways situated in the coal-producing areas of the Commonwealth are obsolete and inadequate for the uses to which they are subjected, and have, in many cases deteriorated to the point where their use is hazardous and represents a potential threat to the safety and welfare of the traveling public; and that the shortage of modern, heavy-duty road systems in such areas is seriously retarding the continued economic growth of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky further determines as a legislative finding of fact that the construction and financing of resource recovery roads through the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky utilizing coal severance tax allocations for the amortization of resource recovery road revenue bonds issued to provide funds to construct such roads will preserve and enhance the economic viability of the Commonwealth, will protect and enhance the safety, health, convenience and general welfare of the traveling public, and will therefore constitute the performance of essential governmental and public purposes.

    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky determines as a legislative finding of fact that the economy of the Commonwealth and the consequent economic development potential of the citizens of the Commonwealth are vitally dependent upon the existence and availability of a statewide system of safe, adequate and well-maintained highways, roads and thoroughfares; that there is a serious need for construction, reconstruction, and in some cases relocation of many such highways, roads and thoroughfares to preserve and enhance the economic well-being and development of the Commonwealth and the health and safety of the public; and that in many cases, highways, roads and thoroughfares which are vital economic links between various sections of the Commonwealth have become, by reason of age and continued usage obsolete and are no longer capable of affording the services required in a modern industrial society. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky further determines as a legislative finding of fact that the construction, reconstruction, and relocation of a system of such economic development roads through the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky will preserve and enhance the economic viability of the Commonwealth, will enable the Commonwealth to prosper and make available its economic potentials to the fullest possible degree, will protect and enhance the safety, health, convenience and welfare of the traveling public and will therefore constitute the performance of essential governmental and public purposes.

   <p class="p7">
    The Department of Transportation (now Transportation Cabinet) cannot use the “turnkey” method for bidding highway construction projects since there is nothing in the road building chapters of the KRS which would authorize the use of such method and to do so would ignore the public policy embodied in this section of obtaining the most qualified and competent engineering services at the lowest possible price because this section requires in effect that the engineer’s plans and specifications be completed before the Bureau of Highways may advertise for bids.

    The provisions of the Model Procurement Code, including subsection (4) of 45A.030 which does not define “construction” to include road building and subsection (1) of KRS 45A.050, which excises road building from the operation of KRS Chapter 45A, prevent use of the “turnkey” technique, whereby the project specifications sent out to prequalified contractors include planning and design services by engineers obtained by the bidding contractor, by the Department of Transportation (now Transportation Cabinet); the public policy of obtaining the most qualified and competent engineering services at the lowest possible price which is embodied in this section would simply be ignored by utilizing the “turnkey” technique because that statute in effect requires that the engineer’s plans and specifications be completed before the Department of Highways may advertise for bids.

If the fiscal court declines, the department shall give notice to all private persons entitled to a necessary access over this road of their rights under this chapter; and, by petition of any private party entitled to such access, the road shall be deemed a discontinued state road and shall be closed to public use but remain open in accordance with its condition and use for the access of the private parties involved.

The department shall keep careful account of the money advanced by the county to the state, and when the project of which the road is a part has been completed, the state shall refund to the county the money advanced upon proper certification of the department, if the road is to be accepted by the commissioner of highways as a part of the state primary road system.

    A county attorney and his law partner, who is the Commonwealth’s Attorney of that district, may pursue cases pending against the Department of Highways which are not in that county or judicial district, since there is no conflict of interest. OAG 70-307.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county attorney should not engage in negotiations relating to state highway rights-of-way located in his county nor condemnation cases arising in his county even though he was retained prior to assuming office, but he may represent private parties involved in condemnation proceedings in other counties since his statutory obligations as county attorney do not extend to other counties.

   <li class="p9">
    For the purpose of KRS 177.220 to 177.310, a limited access facility is defined as a highway or street especially designed for through traffic, and over, from or to which owners or occupants of abutting land or other persons have no right or easement or only a limited right or easement of access, light, air, or view by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon such limited access facility or for any other reason. Such highways or streets may be parkways, from which trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles shall be excluded; or they may be freeways open to use by all customary forms of street and highway traffic.

    Rural and secondary fund money can be spent on a road which is a part of a county road system, as defined in KRS 178.010, even though county road aid funds authorized by subsection (2) of this section (county roads and bridges) and 179.410 to 179.430 can be spent only on such county roads, since a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution may include a county road, but a “county road” can be only a road meeting the definition under KRS 178.010 and 179.010(1). OAG 79-533.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The term “secondary and rural” is broad enough to include “county roads,” but “county roads” are not necessarily “secondary and rural.” OAG 79-533.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where county fiscal court designated several county roads for repair under the Rural Secondary Road Fund and subsequently the state conferred with party patrons in the county and proceeded to change the list of county roads to be repaired and began repairing county roads without ever seeking or receiving authorization from the fiscal court, the state’s action was legal since the fiscal court was given a chance to recommend as to the project, but the Department of Rural Aid could not agree with the fiscal court. OAG 84-336.

    “County Roads” are public roads which have been formally accepted by the fiscal court of the county as a part of the county road system. OAG 85-73.

   <p class="p7">
    Under the statutory definitions, a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution by the state, under subsection (1) of this section, may include a “county road,” as well as a “secondary and rural road.” However, a “county road,” for purposes of fund distribution, under subsection (2) of this section, can only be a road meeting the definition of KRS 178.010(1)(b). OAG 85-73.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county cannot maintain a road not shown on a county road aid map (County Road Series Map) adopted by the fiscal court, unless such road was entitled to acceptance as a part of the county road system, and has been so accepted by the fiscal court; it is a rebuttable presumption that a road not shown on a County Road Series Map that has been formally adopted for a county, is not a “county road” within the meaning of KRS 178.010(1)(b). OAG 93-48.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Costs of advertising an ordinance for adoption of a road as a county road, and the cost of preparing a deed in connection with conveying a right-of-way to the county, cannot be properly viewed as costs for “construction, reconstruction and maintenance” as used in subsection (2) of this section and therefore such costs cannot be paid for from county road aid funds. OAG 93-64.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where statute directs that an expense allowance shall be received by the county judge/executive, paying agency cannot accede to the request of the county judge/executive that such payment be instead made to the county treasury. OAG 94-67.

    Reading KRS 177.340 and this section together, it is evident that the Department of Rural Aid is required to use its sound discretion in considering the county’s recommendations within the Department’s consideration of the development of a system of secondary highways, which may become a part of the state highway system, at the discretion of the Department of Highways.

    Considering that the statutes permit the spending of Rural and Secondary Road Fund money on “county roads” (as defined by KRS 178.010), under the explicit terms of subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Rural and Municipal Aid and the fiscal court must come to an agreement in order that the Transportation Cabinet can proceed with a “county road” project, pursuant to this chapter and KRS Ch. 179.

    Since § 230 of the Constitution clearly restricts the use of money derived from taxes on gasoline for highway purposes, any legislation directing the money to be used otherwise would be unconstitutional, and broadening a definition of the word “maintenance” to include any activity or project that would decrease cost and expenditures of repair on urban streets and highways would not surmount the constitutional barrier. OAG 78-144.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where funds disbursed by the state from various road use taxes are received by the city pursuant to KRS 177.369, and the city places these funds in an interest-bearing special road fund account, the interest derived therefrom must be applied to the road-related purposes set forth in this section, Const., § 230 mandates this and since subsection (2) of KRS 177.369 narrowly restricts expenditures for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of urban roads and streets. OAG 81-143.

    The funds received by the city under the municipal aid program are subject to the general mandate of Const., § 230 concerning road expenditures; KRS 177.369(2) further limits permissible expenditures of such funds to only the “purpose of construction, reconstruction and maintenance of urban roads and streets set forth in this section”; therefore, since a parking lot is not within the definition of “streets,” the city cannot expend its municipal aid funds to pave a public parking lot.

    With respect to any railroad property or right-of-way upon which railroad tracks are located, any powers of condemnation or of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire only an easement interest therein which shall be located either sufficiently far above or sufficiently far below the grade of any railroad track or tracks upon such railroad property so that neither the proposed project nor any part thereof, including any bridges, abutments, columns, supporting structures and appurtenances, nor any traffic upon it, shall interfere in any manner with the use, operation or maintenance of the trains, tracks, works or appurtenances or other property of the railroad nor endanger the movement of the trains or traffic upon the tracks of the railroad. Prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings for such easement over or under such railroad property or right-of-way, plans and specifications of the proposed project showing compliance with the above-mentioned above or below grade requirements and showing sufficient and safe plans and specifications of such overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be submitted to the railroad for examination and approval. If the railroad fails or refuses within thirty (30) days to approve the plans and specifications so submitted, the matter shall be submitted to the Public Service Commission of Kentucky whose decision, arrived at after due consideration in accordance with its usual procedure, shall be final as to the sufficiency and safety of such plans and specifications and as to such elevations or distances above or below the tracks. Said overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be constructed only in accordance with such plans and specifications and in accordance with such elevations or distances above or below the tracks so approved by the railroad or the Public Service Commission as the case may be. A copy of the plans and specifications approved by the railroad or the Public Service Commission shall be filed as an exhibit with the petition for condemnation.

    The department is authorized to provide, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of turnpike revenue bonds of the Commonwealth for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one or more turnpike projects. The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided in KRS 177.390 to 177.570 for payment. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more of the series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate or rates or method of determining rates, payable at least annually, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be determined by the department, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the department, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the department prior to the issuance of the bonds. The department shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the commissioner of highways, and the great seal of the Commonwealth or a facsimile signature of the commissioner shall be affixed to the bonds and attested by the Secretary of State by his facsimile signature, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the commissioner of highways. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until the delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the department may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The department may sell the bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of KRS 177.390 to 177.570.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for the bonds or any account or accounts as the department shall have provided in the proceedings or trust agreement authorizing and securing the bonds.

The department may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, department, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by KRS 177.390 to 177.570.

    In the discretion of the department, any bonds issued under the provisions of KRS 177.390 to 177.570 may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the department and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust agreement or the proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any turnpike project or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the department in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the turnpike project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates of toll to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the department. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or proceedings may contain such other provisions as the department may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the turnpike project or projects.

    “Scenic quality” means the heightened visual experience derived from the view of the natural and manmade elements of the scenic byway or scenic highway. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and memorable visual experience. All elements of the landscape, including landform, water, vegetation, and manmade development, must contribute in harmony to the quality of the scenic byway’s or scenic highway’s visual environment and share in its intrinsic qualities.

In doing so, the commission shall in all respects observe the restrictive conditions presently applicable to said unissued 1956 bonds, in that any sale or sales shall be for not less than par or face amount with accrued interest to delivery, and at a rate or rates of interest not exceeding, as to any bond, three percent (3%) per annum, payable semiannually, and all of such bonds shall be caused to mature as to principal within thirty (30) years from January 1, 1957.

Inasmuch as said unissued 1956 bonds have been taken into account in determining the amount of money otherwise necessary to be provided through issuance of additional bonds as hereinafter set forth, such proposal that the voters remove said existing interest rate limitation as to the unissued 1956 bonds shall appear on the ballots at the election to be held on November 8, 1960, as a part of the ballot question submitting for authorization and approval KRS 177.700 to 177.820 as a whole and the proposed issuance of an additional one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) of general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth for state parks, and for highways, bridges and tunnels, as hereinafter provided.

It shall then be the duty of the Attorney General to prepare and furnish to the Secretary of State, not later than September 15, 1960, a form of “Notice of Election,” which shall be so designated, shall conform to any requirements otherwise provided by law for notices of elections, and further shall set forth the proper ballot question in full, and KRS 177.700 to 177.820 in full, with provisions for the signature of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall transmit a copy of such form of “Notice of Election” to each of five (5) daily newspapers of bona fide general circulation, published in different areas of the Commonwealth and selected in the discretion of the Secretary of State, with directions that the same be published in each of such newspapers in the form of a legal notice, in one (1) issue published in each of the calendar weeks commencing on Mondays, October 10, 17, 24, and 31, 1960, but not in any Sunday issue.

    The Billboard Advertising Act (KRS 177.830 to 177.890) is constitutional as a proper exercise of the state police power and the agreement entered into with the United States department of commerce, bureau of public roads concerning the construction of the interstate highway system in Kentucky did not constitute a relinquishment by the state of the right to exercise its police power. Moore v. Ward, 377 S.W.2d 881, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 505 (Ky. 1964).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Billboard Advertising Act is not unconstitutional as a retroactive or retrospective act since it does not affect or impair rights existing prior to the date of its enactment nor is it unconstitutional as an ex post facto act since it does not impose a criminal penalty upon any person for any prior act and it is not an arbitrary exercise of state police power. Moore v. Ward, 377 S.W.2d 881, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 505 (Ky. 1964).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Billboard Act and regulations are content neutral since they are not directed at the content of the messages, but at their secondary effects, and they apply evenhandedly to commercial and noncommercial speech. Wheeler v. Commissioner of Highways, 822 F.2d 586, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 7865 (6th Cir. Ky. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1007, 108 S. Ct. 702, 98 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 300 (U.S. 1988).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The interest in promoting the recreational value of public travel and preserving natural beauty along interstate highways is substantial and sufficient to support the content neutral restrictions of the Billboard Act, these restrictions are narrowly tailored to achieve this interest, and these restrictions leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information; therefore, the Billboard Act does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.Wheeler v. Commissioner of Highways, 822 F.2d 586, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 7865 (6th Cir. Ky. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1007, 108 S. Ct. 702, 98 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 300 (U.S. 1988).

    In consolidated actions challenging the application of Kentucky’s Billboard Advertising Act, KRS 177.830 through 177.890, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, because plaintiffs failed to obtain a permit for their billboards containing religious messages and the signs were thus subject to removal as public nuisances due to the lack of a permit. While plaintiffs had a right to express and share their religion with the motoring public, the Commonwealth of Kentucky had a right to place reasonable restrictions on the place and manner that message is conveyed, particularly when aimed at protecting public safety and preserving the public environment; government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens’
    search for spiritual fulfillment, yet the government simply could not operate if it was required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires. Harston v. Commonwealth Transp. Cabinet, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 40 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 943 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 4, 2011), review denied, ordered not published, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 219 (Ky. Feb. 15, 2012).

    Regulations of Transportation Cabinet governing lighted message boards which prohibited commercial speech but allowed time, date, temperature or weather information to be displayed were substantially broader than necessary to protect the governmental interests of highway safety and aesthetics. Cabinet failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the requirements of highway safety and aesthetics and had not narrowly tailored the regulation to achieve any desired objectives and therefore developed an unconstitutional regulation on commercial free speech as well as upon noncommercial free speech because the state had chosen to allow some noncommercial messages to be displayed.

    Subsection (2) of KRS 177.841 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in failing to define “located outside an urban area” with sufficient precision to put the public on notice as to the areas to which it would apply. Further, this defect was not constitutionally relieved by the General Assembly in subsection (10) of this section prior to its 1990 amendment which delegated to the Secretary of Transportation the responsibility of defining the term “urban,” because this became a constitutionally impermissible delegation of the legislative function. Diemer v. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet, Dep't of Highways, 786 S.W.2d 861, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1990) (decision prior to 1990 amendment of this section).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The language in KRS 177.842 extending the definition of “urban area” to advertising devices erected after 1976 was intended only to identify the advertising devices to which the amendment applied, rather than to make the definition of urban area contained in subsection (10) of this section retroactive to 1976. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet, Dep't of Highways v. Wayfara, Inc., 840 S.W.2d 211, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 105 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).

    There is nothing in Ky.

    Because of the express prohibition set out in subsection (1), the state does not have the authority to issue regulations allowing advertising within the so-called “Cotton areas,” i.e., areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way. OAG 83-461.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When KRS 177.865(2) is read in connection with the rest of that statute and KRS 177.860, it does not appear that KRS 177.865(2) was meant to carve out an exemption to the prohibitions on advertising set forth in this section; rather, it was simply a part of the legislation to allow certain advertising devices within the highway rights-of-way to provide directional information for establishments offering goods and services to the traveling public. OAG 83-461.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Kentucky General Assembly specifically expressed its intent concerning the “Cotton areas” (areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way) when it enacted subdivision (1) of this section and expressly prohibited the erection or maintenance of advertising devices within the “Cotton areas” and the fact that the Kentucky General Assembly did not mention the element of time of acquisition of rights-of-way indicates that it intended to prohibit such advertising regardless of when such rights-of-way were acquired.

    The so-called “Junkyard Act,” KRS 177.905 to 177.950, which as enacted was entitled “an act relating to auto and truck recyclers” applies to all material recyclers, not just auto and truck recyclers, and such interpretation does not violate Const., § 51, which has the purpose of preventing “surreptitious” legislation, since all that is required of the title of an act is to give a general idea of the contents rather than to specifically refer to every provision.

   <p class="p7">
    The so-called “Junkyard Act,” does not require that the location where five or more junked, wrecked or nonoperative automobiles, vehicles or machines are located be a business, since such an interpretation is simply not logical in view of the overall purpose of the statute which is to regulate locations, such as traditional “junkyards.” Dawson v.

    An unmade city street and a city street do not come within the definition of “road” contained in KRS 177.905(1). OAG 63-551.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A junkyard or recycling establishment, as defined in this section, found within the city limits and located closer than 1000 feet to the center line of any street which is part of any county, state or federal limited access highway or turnpike, is subject to the state statutes requiring a permit for the operation of such an establishment; establishments not subject to state regulation may be regulated by the city under its police power but it is doubtful that the city can prohibit entirely the operation of junkyards within the city limits as they are not normally considered to be nuisances per se. OAG 82-205.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The state’s authority relating to the issuing of permits for junkyards located closer than 1000 feet to the center line of any road would not include those areas involving city streets that were not a part of any county, state or federal highway system; a city of the fifth class, under its general police power, could then regulate, inspect and issue licenses for the operation of those junkyards or recycling establishments within the corporate limits not coming under the coverage of the state act or which fell within the exception referred to in KRS 177.912. OAG 82-205.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Those junkyards and recycling establishments which have not satisfied the provisions of KRS 177.912, and are subject to the provisions of KRS 177.905 to 177.950, cannot rely upon satisfying zoning provisions to escape the statutory permit requirements; furthermore, they could not qualify as a “nonconforming use” if they were not lawfully in existence prior to the effective date of the zoning ordinance.

    Any person engaged in the mining, processing, transporting or sale of coal that provides for the transportation of coal in vehicles exceeding the maximum weight limits on the state-maintained system shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Highways, or give bond for damages as provided by KRS 189.271, if a road to be used is not part of the extended weight coal or coal by-products haul road system. However, if a resolution issued pursuant to KRS 177.9771(9) on a road with a maximum allowable gross weight of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds is approved by the Transportation Cabinet, a cooperative agreement shall not be required. Such cooperative agreements shall provide for an equitable apportionment of the incremental costs for design, maintenance, construction, or reconstruction of those roads and bridges, except those roads and bridges which are part of the federal interstate highway system, resulting from the transportation of coal by trucks transporting coal in excess of the maximum weight limits on the state-maintained system and covered by the cooperative agreement.

The Transportation Cabinet may allow any person, under the cooperative agreement, to provide for the design, approved maintenance, construction, or reconstruction provided for in subsection (1) of this section in accordance with guidelines or standards prescribed by the cabinet. In the event any person exceeds his annual total tax contribution as authorized under a cooperative agreement, such person may petition the commissioner of vehicle regulation for a carry over for future years liability. All funds collected pursuant to this section shall be expended on those roads covered by the cooperative agreement.

    (7/14/2000). The reference to “KRS 65.220 to 65.300” in subsection (4) of this section has been changed back to its original form of “KRS 65.210 to 65.300.” Subsection (4) was added to this statute by 1984 Ky. Acts ch. 7, sec. 1, and contained the reference to “KRS 65.210 to 65.300.” Although the amendment of the statute by 1986 Ky. Acts ch. 278, sec. 2 did not change this reference, it was altered to “KRS 65.220 to 65.300” in the codification of that Act. Because it is clear from an examination of KRS Chapter 65 that the range in question is KRS 65.210 to 65.300 and no reason is given or can be determined for altering the text as originally enacted, the original text of the reference has been restored.

    Prior to the 1964 amendment public roads were established by the county court.

   <p class="p7">
    Before a public road can be accepted as part of county road system, and improved and maintained by the county, it must have been established by order of the county court. Rose v. Nolen, 166 Ky. 336, 179 S.W. 229, 1915 Ky. LEXIS 687 (Ky. 1915).

    Failure of county to establish road used by public as a county road does not deprive public of its use as a highway, if, independent of statute, conditions surrounding its use are such as to create right of use by public. Rose v. Nolen, 166 Ky. 336, 179 S.W. 229, 1915 Ky. LEXIS 687 (Ky. 1915).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The establishment of a public road is a function of the county court and a fiscal court cannot under KRS 67.080 purchase a toll turnpike not established by the county court. Roberts v. Taylor, 226 Ky. 640, 11 S.W.2d 710, 1928 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 1928).

   <p class="p7">
    “Public highways” are public roads established by the county courts. Roberts v. Taylor, 226 Ky. 640, 11 S.W.2d 710, 1928 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 1928).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A public road may be established only in the manner provided by statute, or by dedication to the public use and acceptance by the proper authorities as a public road. Neither dedication nor acceptance need be formal, and both can be presumed from continual use by the public for 15 years or more, accompanied by acts of control on the part of the county court; but mere use, without the exercise of control by the county court, is not sufficient. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Engle, 278 Ky. 576, 129 S.W.2d 133, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 470 (Ky. 1939) (decision prior to enactment of KRS 178.115).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A permissive use of road never ripens into presumption of grant, but where road is used as matter of right for 15 years, presumption of grant arises. Bryant v. Penn, 280 Ky. 428, 133 S.W.2d 521, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 131 (Ky. 1939).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Before a road open to the public shall be recognized as a county road, it must be established by order of county court. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Hopkins County, 369 S.W.2d 116, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 63 (Ky. 1963).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A street may be dedicated to public use by approval of the planning commission and recording of a plat pursuant to KRS 100.277 and 100.283, but it must still be accepted by the fiscal court through the procedures in KRS chapter 178 before it becomes a street which is open for the use of the public generally; acceptance by the county is not mandatory. Kemper v. Cooke, 576 S.W.2d 263, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 364 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fiscal court could not rely on the presumption of regularity to prove that a road was a county road, having produced no order accepting the road into its system of maintenance or changing its name to the name of a road that had been accepted by such an order. Cary v. Pulaski County Fiscal Court, 420 S.W.3d 500, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 85 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Obstruction of a lane was improper because it was an open public road instead of a private passway; the location of the public road could not have been altered by the construction or installation of a private drive. A portion of the lane formerly maintained by the county that provided necessary access for a private person continued to serve as an open public road; the lane was not a county road because it had never been adopted as such. Sproul v. Ky. Props. Holding, LLC, 2014 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1031 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2014), rev'd, superseded, 507 S.W.3d 563, 2016 Ky. LEXIS 428 (Ky. 2016).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Court of Appeals properly held that a neighbor failed to prove the existence of any county road, public passway, or easement across an owner's property because the road was never officially adopted by the county and the neighbor's evidence was insufficient to establish adverse use of the road by the public by estoppel or prescription. Ellington v. Becraft, 534 S.W.3d 785, 2017 Ky. LEXIS 510 (Ky. 2017).

    Under this section and KRS 178.080 roads crossing national forest land, which have been used for years by the public and for which easements were reserved in the deeds of the land to the United States, should not be maintained by the county until they have been accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system; otherwise the county would be maintaining private roads which it is without authority to do.

   <p class="p7">
    Although a road segment lying within the boundaries of a sixth-class city may be included in a special services district program established by the county, the legislative body of the city has no authority to turn over any money from its gasoline tax fund or its revenue sharing fund to the fiscal court for maintenance of the city street segment.

   <p class="p7">
    While county road fund money cannot be spent on road segments which are not a part of the county road system, if the fiscal court desires to take city street segments into the county system for maintenance purposes it may do so by an appropriate order (specific and formal), and subject to proper budgetary and financial procedure and limitations, but such an order must not interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of the city legislative body over city streets. OAG 78-211.

   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has authority to appropriate money for the construction or maintenance or improvement of any road segment lying within the boundaries of the county and, in general, this permissibility would also apply to bridges. OAG 78-250.

   <p class="p7">
    This section permits a fiscal court to take city streets into the county road system, subject to proper budgetary and financial limitations although the fiscal court in entering such a formal order would have to keep in mind that a city of the fifth class, under KRS 94.360 (now repealed), has exclusive jurisdiction or control over the public ways or streets of that city. OAG 78-250.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has exclusive authority over county roads, including the authority to construct, maintain and operate such roads in the public interest of the health, safety, welfare and convenience of the inhabitants of the county. OAG 79-393.

   <p class="p7">
    Rural and secondary fund money can be spent on a road which is a part of a county road system, as defined in this section, even though county road aid funds authorized by KRS 177.320(2) (county roads and bridges) and 179.410 to 179.430 (KRS 179.420 and 179.430 now repealed) can be spent only on such county roads, since a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution may include a county road, but a “county road” can be only a road meeting the definition under this section and KRS 179.010(1). OAG 79-533.

   <p class="p7">
    The term “secondary and rural” is broad enough to include “county roads,” but “county roads” are not necessarily “secondary and rural.” OAG 79-533.

    The fiscal court may approve of an administrative code provision whereby the county judge/executive could, under a properly defined emergency situation, take steps to effect repair of a county road or bridge, subject, however, to a ratification of such action by the fiscal court as a body at the first meeting opportunity. OAG 80-368.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The responsibility for determining precisely just what specifically designated road segments and bridges will be constructed, reconstructed, maintained or repaired, rests with the fiscal court as a body, not the county judge/executive, and the county judge/executive cannot order the road department to begin work on a particular bridge without fiscal court approval. OAG 80-368.

   <p class="p7">
    If a fiscal court votes to establish a road as a county road but the evidence indicates that the proposed road would be of private benefit only, the county attorney could file an injunctive civil suit in circuit court, seeking the enjoining of any action implementing the decision to establish the road. OAG 80-382.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county road is a public road which has been accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system by a formal order of the fiscal court and the fiscal court has a duty to maintain county roads, however, the mere maintenance of a road, without any formal fiscal court orders, would not make it a county road; therefore, the fiscal court has the authority to cease the maintaining of a road, without any formal action, concerning which road no formal orders of fiscal court were entered of record. OAG 80-489.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If the public has acquired the free use of a roadway by user, considering that a public user ordinarily ripens into a prescriptive easement in 15 years, the fiscal court could continue to maintain the road if the traveling public requests the fiscal court to do so, or even if it appears that the roadway is used by the traveling public in a substantial way, even against the objections of the adjacent landowners; in such situation the fiscal court would be merely permissively using the users’ prescriptive rights as a vehicle for maintaining the public road. OAG 80-489.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court may expend county funds for the maintenance of the road leading to the public cemetery, provided that such road has been taken into the county road system by way of a formal order of the fiscal court. OAG 80-562.

   <p class="p7">
    The conventional system of county road acceptance under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section and 178.115, and the special acceptance procedure under KRS 179.470 are mutually exclusive; thus a subdivision road may be taken into the county road system by the conventional method, and the provisions of KRS 179.470 would not apply. OAG 80-583.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has the authority to accept a paved road in a subdivision and place the road in the county road system without cost to the owners of lots in the subdivision. OAG 80-602.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county, through fiscal court, has no responsibility nor authority for bringing an injunctive action, where a mere public road (not a county road) has been obstructed. OAG 80-613.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (3) of KRS 179.470 would apply where a county contains one city of the fourth class and the rest of the county is basically unincorporated, except for a subdivision located in an unincorporated area of the county just outside the city limits in which subdivision all but two streets have previously been placed on the county road maintenance system and dedicated to public use; however, the subdivision’s streets may be taken into the county road system pursuant to subsection (1) (a) of this section and 178.115 pursuant to the judgment of the fiscal court and under this more conventional method KRS 179.470 would not apply. OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under this section, KRS 178.080, KRS 178.115, or KRS 179.470; however, the reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under KRS 179.470 would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under KRS 179.470 before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where KRS 42.490 transfers the coal haul road money from unencumbered fund balances under KRS 42.300 (repealed), KRS 42.330 (repealed) and KRS 177.970 (repealed) to the local government assistance fund under KRS 42.450 et seq. of a county which has no county road over which coal is being hauled, the county through the fiscal court can spend the funds on one or more of the priority categories listed under subsections 2(a) through 2(j) of KRS 42.455 including any county road under subsection 2(c) within the limits of this section, even though no coal is hauled over it. OAG 81-15.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a proposed street will run from a county recreational park to a city street, city commission approval of the proposed street means that the street will become a part of the city street system, and the city will have exclusive municipal jurisdiction or control over it under KRS 82.082; however, the fiscal court of the county may maintain the proposed street as a part of the county road system under the authority of this section and KRS 67.083, assuming that the city approves of the dedication, subject to the approval of the city commission. OAG 81-142.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As a basic rule, where the fiscal court has not by formal action accepted a particular road segment into the county road system, it has no authority to spend county money on it or to maintain or improve it in any way. The only exceptions to this basic rule relate to sidewalks and bus turn-arounds for school children, as treated under KRS 178.290. OAG 82-136.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county bridge may only be constructed on a county right-of-way and linking segments of a county road and the bridge must be a part of a public road accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system; a formal order of fiscal court is necessary to establish a county road. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In the event the fiscal court as a body enacts a resolution accepting a roadway as a part of the county road system, the county attorney has a duty to take all reasonable legal action to determine the title status, if it becomes actually necessary. OAG 82-228.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There can be no “county road” in the legal and technical sense until and unless fiscal court, as a body, enacts an order or resolution specifically making a particular road a part of the county road system. OAG 82-228.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Once the fiscal court “accepts” a road segment as a part of the county road system, a formal order of fiscal court would be necessary for its effective abandonment by the county. OAG 82-363.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where an old county road is fenced or blocked off by adjacent property owners, if it is determined that the county accepted the road as a county road, then the fiscal court can either abandon it by a formal order or it may improve the road and take legal steps to eliminate the fencing and blocking off activities of adjacent property owners, depending upon what is felt to be in the best interests of the county as a whole. If the fiscal court never “accepted” the road formally, or informally prior to 1914, as a county road, and the fiscal court does not deem it to be in the public interest to now formally accept it as a county road, then it would appear that the fiscal court has no further responsibility nor interest in the controversy. OAG 82-363.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where old county roads were abandoned to varying degrees and were not maintained by the county for over 50 years, but were never officially closed, if the fiscal court either formally (on and after 1914) or informally (prior to 1914) accepted the roads as a part of the county road system, then the fiscal court had a duty to maintain them. If the fiscal court believed it in the best public interest to abandon such roads as county roads, it must do so by a formal order. OAG 82-363.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Generally, a fiscal court has no authority to use county road equipment and crews on city streets, except where the city street segment has been made a part of the county road system for purposes of construction, maintenance, or repair; thus, a fiscal court may contribute to the maintenance or construction of a city street if it so elects by making such street a county through road; however, such county action is permissive only. OAG 82-418.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a county cannot furnish county equipment and road employees to maintain or construct a city street unless such street is made a part of the county road system, the mere fact that an interlocal agreement is being entered into that does not encompass the city street’s being made a part of the county road system would not convert it into a lawful project. OAG 82-418.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If the fiscal court had never entered a formal order accepting a road as a part of the county road system and had never acquired the easement or title to the road by instrument or user, it was not a “county road,” as defined in subdivision (1)(b) of this section. However, if the fiscal court had entered a formal order of acceptance and if the public user had ripened into a prescriptive easement for 15 years, it was a “county road.” OAG 82-445.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court can “establish” a road or strip of land as a part of the county road system prior to obtaining easements or title from the owners. However, the fiscal court cannot start road work on the land in question until the owner has received or been tendered compensation; the fiscal court must either pay the owners for the land to be used for the county road or must tender the compensation prior to the county’s going on the land and beginning the road work. OAG 83-125.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s or general public interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Chapter 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 68.100 and Const., § 180, would prohibit the expenditure of county road money on the construction and maintenance of swinging bridges, which are isolated walk bridges generally found in the mountains, and which by definition are not an integral part of a “county road.” Thus, by definition of a county road, a legal county bridge is a bridge which is a necessary and integral part of a county road. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There must validly exist a county right-of-way on both sides of a stream in order for the county to build a bridge across the stream, and there can be no public interest involved where the bridge dead-ends on one piece of private property. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Once the fiscal court entered an order accepting and establishing the particular county roads in question as a part of the county road system, such roads became county roads under subdivision (1)(b) of this section, even assuming that the minimal width of 30 feet was not observed. It was then up to the fiscal court to acquire the additional right-of-ways which would bring these county roads at least up to the mandated minimal width. OAG 83-290.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although the city has exclusive jurisdiction and control over its city streets, a fiscal court, with the consent of the city, may, pursuant to KRS 67.083 and this section, take city streets into the county road system by fiscal court order for the purpose of expending county money on the construction or improvement of such streets. OAG 83-321.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county cannot legally accept title to city streets so as to militate against the jurisdiction of the city; in any event, where a city street is made a part of the county road system by fiscal court order, it would in no way take away the city’s control and jurisdiction as relates to city street right-of-way needed for cable television and the county could not include city streets in its ordinance for a cable television franchise. OAG 83-321.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court’s jurisdiction, including its powers relating to the county roads and bridges, extends only to territory within the particular county’s boundaries. Thus, a county had no statutory authority to unilaterally spend county money on a bridge located in another county. OAG 83-340.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A fiscal court may not haul and apply county road materials to a city street which is wholly unconnected with the county road system, even if the city paid the costs of the materials. OAG 83-398.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county fiscal court may not haul and apply county road materials to a city street which is wholly unconnected with the county road system, with the city paying the costs of the materials; also, KRS 79.110 and 79.120 would not permit the city and county to contract for the county to supply some portion of the cost of the service on the theory that the residents of the city are also residents of the county paying both city and county taxes. OAG 83-439.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section implies that a road segment adopted as a part of the county road system requires any necessary construction and maintenance as a part of the county road system; ordinarily the fiscal court can maintain only those road segments specifically acquired as a part of the county road system. OAG 84-65.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where subdivision road segment used by public school buses in county containing a fourth-class city had not been acquired as a part of the county’s road system, the fiscal court had no authority to make repairs on that road. OAG 84-65.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The discontinuance of a public road, which is not a county road, as defined by subdivision (1)(b) of this section, requires no formal action of the fiscal court; the fact that the county once maintained it is not controlling. OAG 84-358.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    County acceptance of a road segment as a part of the county road system requires a formal order of the fiscal court; though a road may be public because of its public use, it is not a county road where the fiscal court has not formally adopted it as a part of the county road system. Thus if the road is merely a public road, and is not a county road, the fiscal court has no responsibility for its upkeep or discontinuance. OAG 84-358.

    The gross weight limit of 36,000 pounds, provided in KRS 189.221(4), applies to any truck, semitrailer truck or truck and trailer unit, operating upon any highway regardless of the nature of its cargo, including coal, timber or other natural resources; the truck weight limitation, which applies explicitly to “any highway,” would include county roads. OAG 85-40.

    Under the statutory definitions, a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution by the state, under KRS 177.320(1), may include a “county road,” as well as a “secondary and rural road.” However, a “county road,” for purposes of fund distribution, under KRS 177.320(2), can only be a road meeting the definition of subdivision (1)(b) of this section. OAG 85-73.

   <p class="p7">
    Considering that the statutes permit the spending of Rural and Secondary Road Fund money on “county roads” (as defined by this section), under the explicit terms of KRS 177.330(1), the Department of Rural and Municipal Aid and the fiscal court must come to an agreement in order that the Transportation Cabinet can proceed with a “county road” project, pursuant to KRS Chapters 177 and 179. OAG 85-73.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county may not continue to maintain a road which is not a county road, even if the public has acquired the free use of the road by prescriptive easement and the traveling public requests the fiscal court to maintain the road, unless the fiscal court acts in what it perceives to be the best interests of the county by designating the road as a county road.

    A road accepted into the county road system must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet, irrespective of whether it had previously existed as a road used by the public for a substantial period. OAG 91-114.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet. OAG 64-148 is hereby overruled to the extent it concludes that “subsection (2) of 178.040 applies to new locations and to new roads and not to existing roads taken over by the county officials . . . . . ” OAG 91-114.

   <p class="p7">
    A county cannot maintain a road not shown on a county road aid map (County Road Series Map) adopted by the fiscal court, unless such road was entitled to acceptance as a part of the county road system, and has been so accepted by the fiscal court; it is a rebuttable presumption that a road not shown on a County Road Series Map that has been formally adopted for a county, is not a “county road” within the meaning of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

    This section is unrelated to the 15-year prescriptive easement rule; it merely provides in effect that any road dedicated by the owner or owners of the property as a public way and used by the general public without restrictions for five consecutive years shall conclusively be presumed to be a public road. Therefore, this section has no application where there is no record of any owner dedication. OAG 82-123.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in this section; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of KRS 178.040(2) had to be complied with. OAG 83-88.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The discontinuance of a public road, which is not a county road, as defined by KRS 178.010(1)(b), requires no formal action of the fiscal court; the fact that the county once maintained it is not controlling. OAG 84-358.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A public road that is not a county road can be abandoned without formal action of the fiscal court, and a reverter to former owners would occur, Williams v. Woodward, 240 S.W.2d 94, 1951 Ky. LEXIS 956 (Ky. 1951). Thus, where a public road is not used by the general traveling public for at least 15 continuous and uninterrupted years, an abandonment could be said to have taken place, without any formal action of the fiscal court. OAG 84-358.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where no boundaries are readily identifiable, as described in this section, to indicate “public property,” KRS 512.080 may still be enforced. OAG 91-151.

    Subsection (2) of this section applies to new locations and to new roads and not to existing public roads taken over by the county officials, whether by formal order of the county court, or by work and material being placed on them. OAG 64-148.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Once a subdivision plat has been approved pursuant to KRS 100.277 the streets become county roads, and their width is controlled by this section; therefore a county board of adjustments has no authority pursuant to KRS 100.241 to grant a variance of such a street’s right-of-way only to 26 feet since subsection (2) of this section mandates a 30 foot right-of-way, but a lesser width may be all that need be actually paved. OAG 78-567.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in KRS 178.025; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of subsection (2) of this section had to be complied with. OAG 83-88.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The acquiring of a minimal right-of-way of 30 feet is mandatory if it is to become a county road in the legal, technical sense. OAG 83-88.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Any county road established on and after the effective date of the 1914 legislation creating this section is subject to a mandated width of 30 feet right-of-way. The fiscal court can make it more than 30 feet, but 30 feet in width, as to the right-of-way, is mandated. OAG 83-290.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Once the fiscal court entered an order accepting and establishing the particular county roads in question as a part of the county road system, such roads became county roads under KRS 178.010(1)(b), even assuming that the minimal width of 30 feet was not observed. It was then up to the fiscal court to acquire the additional right-of-ways which would bring these county roads at least up to the mandated minimal width. OAG 83-290.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A road accepted into the county road system must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet, irrespective of whether it had previously existed as a road used by the public for a substantial period. OAG 91-114.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet. OAG 64-148 is hereby overruled to the extent it concludes that “subsection (2) of 178.040 applies to new locations and to new roads and not to existing roads taken over by the county officials . . . . . ” OAG 91-114.

    In a county that has no road engineer or road supervisor, the attempted closing of a county road with the aid of only a county road foreman would not be substantial compliance with the pertinent statutes. OAG 66-366.

    Where a dead-end county road was closed by the fiscal court on a landowner’s misrepresentation that he was the sole owner of the adjoining land, another adjoining landowner or the county attorney could not appeal the decision four years later even if the fiscal court did not give proper notice of the intent to close the road.

    The placing of gates, with locks and keys, on each end of a public lane which connects two county roads cannot be done without formally closing the lane to the public, as prescribed by this chapter, and removing it from the county road system. OAG 80-224.

    Where the principal use of a road, which was partially washed out when the Kentucky River flooded, was for private access to private property, rather than for a public purpose, the road should be discontinued as a county road. Since such discontinuance will effectively deny one landowner reasonable vehicular ingress and egress from his property to the public highway system, the county would presumably be liable for the depreciation in value of the property of the one landowner so affected. OAG 93-10.

   <p class="p7">
    Costs of advertising an ordinance for adoption of a road as a county road, and the cost of preparing a deed in connection with conveying a right-of-way to the county, cannot be properly viewed as costs for “construction, reconstruction and maintenance” as used in subsection (2) of KRS 177.320, and therefore such costs cannot be paid for from county road aid funds.

    Judgment on the pleadings was properly granted in favor of a county in a city’s action for reimbursement for repairs made to a county road within the city’s annexed territory because once the city annexed the county road, it was the responsibility of the city to maintain that road and the county was relieved of maintenance responsibilities for the road; further, the statutory provisions regarding the discontinuance of a road did not apply because only the legal character of the road had changed.

   <p class="p7">
    The General Assembly did not intend to impose KRS 178.116 upon the authority of a fiscal court to close a county road under this section; however, where a county has taken no formal action to discontinue a county road under this section, KRS 178.116 would then apply, provided the terms of the latter statute are met.

    This section has no bearing on the discontinuing of a road by operation of law under KRS 178.116, except that under KRS 178.116(4), where a county road has been discontinued under this section, then by a joint petition of all private parties entitled to necessary access, the road shall be closed to public use but remain open in accordance with its condition and use for the access of the private parties affected, or by a joint petition of all parties entitled to necessary access, the road shall revert to the owner or owners of the tract or tracts of land to which it originally belonged.

    Where the principal use of a road, which was partially washed out when the Kentucky River flooded, was for private access to private property, rather than for a public purpose, the road should be discontinued as a county road. Since such discontinuance will effectively deny one landowner reasonable vehicular ingress and egress from his property to the public highway system, the county would presumably be liable for the depreciation in value of the property of the one landowner so affected.

They shall make careful examination of routes or locations other than that proposed or petitioned for, keeping in view the possible future development of the county and the accommodations of the general traveling public, and shall report to the fiscal court at a public meeting in favor of the one they prefer, giving reasons for the preference. A map giving the grades and bearings of the routes or locations shall be returned with the report.

    Under this section and KRS 178.010 roads crossing national forest land, which have been used for years by the public and for which easements were reserved in the deeds of the land to the United States, should not be maintained by the county until they have been accepted by the fiscal court as a part of the county road system; otherwise the county would be maintaining private roads which it is without authority to do.

    If a fiscal court votes to establish a road as a county road but the evidence indicates that the proposed road would be of private benefit only, the county attorney could file an injunctive civil suit in circuit court, seeking the enjoining of any action implementing the decision to establish the road.

    Where county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, KRS 178.115, this section or KRS 179.470; however, the reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under KRS 179.470 would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under KRS 179.470 before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The establishment of a county road to a community of two or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.115 and this section, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a circuit court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal could be taken from a fiscal court order to the district court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under KRS 178.115 and this section, the initial decision as to the construction or altering of any particular county road by the county is not a mandatory function but is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, which body can determine whether or not a proposed project is deemed to be in the best interest of the county so as to constitute the necessity for such road; the “necessity for a road” arises in the context of the county’s condemnation proceedings, once the fiscal court determines that such road construction is in the public interest.

    Whenever the fiscal court of any county deems it to be in the best interest of the county to open, establish or alter the location of any public road, street, alley, ditch, culvert, bridge or similar public way or structure in the county, the fiscal court shall adopt a resolution setting forth the necessity for the public road or structure, and thereupon the public road or structure shall be deemed opened, established or altered, as the case may be, on behalf of the county. A certified copy of the resolution shall be posted at the courthouse door of the county within five (5) days after its adoption and a certified copy of the resolution shall be posted by the county road engineer of the county along or at the proposed road or structure within five (5) days after its adoption.

    <span class="boldspan">

    In all cases where public roads or structures have been established, any person or persons aggrieved thereby may prosecute an appeal from a resolution of the fiscal court by filing a petition in equity in the Circuit Court of the county where the road or structure is located setting forth his grievance, to which petition shall be attached an attested or certified copy of the resolution. The petition shall be filed within thirty-five (35) days from the date the resolution was entered. An appeal shall be heard and decided by the court without the intervention of a jury. Any party so appealing shall execute and file a bond for costs at the time such appeal is taken. An appeal to the Court of Appeals may be taken in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

   <p class="p7">
    The general fund of one county cannot be expended to purchase right of way for county roads in another county. OAG 64-191.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under this section, the acceptance of a county road for maintenance is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court and depends upon whether the fiscal court deems such road to be in the best interest of the county. Even if the sections relating to subdivisions have been complied with (see KRS 100.277 and 100.301) and even if a dedication of portions of the subdivision to public purposes has been made expressly, the county is not obligated automatically to accept such dedicated land for street or road purposes. OAG 72-80.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The acceptance of a road segment into the county road system rests in the sound discretion of the fiscal court, and it is not necessary that roads be deeded to the county before they are accepted by the county as the fiscal court can enter a resolution under this section establishing a county road prior to any acquisition or conveyance of necessary land. OAG 72-81.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Generally, the acceptance of a road for county maintenance, as a part of the county road system, is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, but the action of a fiscal court, in exercising such discretion, could be reviewed in a Circuit Court action under an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion. OAG 78-121.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has the authority to establish an existing road as a county road and whether it does or not is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court after determining whether such an action is in the county’s best interest, considering such factors as the cost of acquisition and maintenance of the road, the condition of the road at the present time and the impact of such action on the county’s budget. OAG 78-181.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Once a road becomes a part of the county road system, the fiscal court has the duty to be diligent in keeping it in repair. OAG 78-121.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county, through its fiscal court, may build a road leading to a subdivision if it will lie in the county, but not within city boundaries, and there is no requirement that the road be a throughway or that it give access to more than one area. OAG 78-374.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 67.075(1) amends this section by implication. OAG 79-294.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since the format of “resolution or order” is irreconcilable with “ordinance,” the matter of accepting roads as a part of the county road system is a matter of general and lasting nature, and the road matter should take the form of an ordinance. OAG 79-294.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court, in taking action authorizing the alteration of an existing county road, could legally take such action by enacting, at a properly held meeting of fiscal courts, a resolution. OAG 79-410.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court may approve of an administrative code provision whereby the county judge/executive could, under a properly defined emergency situation, take steps to effect repair of a county road or bridge, subject, however, to a ratification of such action by the fiscal court as a body at the first meeting opportunity. OAG 80-368.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The responsibility for determining precisely just what specifically designated road segments and bridges will be constructed, reconstructed, maintained or repaired, rests with the fiscal court as a body, not the county judge/executive, and the county judge/executive cannot order the road department to begin work on a particular bridge without fiscal court approval. OAG 80-368.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The conventional system of county road acceptance under KRS 178.010(1)(b) and this section, and the special acceptance procedure under KRS 179.470 are mutually exclusive; thus a subdivision road may be taken into the county road system by the conventional method, and the provisions of KRS 179.470 would not apply. OAG 80-583.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has the authority to accept a paved road in a subdivision and place the road in the county road system without cost to the owners of lots in the subdivision. OAG 80-602.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (3) of KRS 179.470 would apply where a county contains one city of the fourth class and the rest of the county is basically unincorporated, except for a subdivision located in an unincorporated area of the county just outside the city limits in which subdivision all but two streets have previously been placed on the county road maintenance system and dedicated to public use; however, the subdivision’s streets may be taken into the county road system pursuant to KRS 178.010(1)(a) and this section pursuant to the judgment of the fiscal court and under this more conventional method KRS 179.470 would not apply. OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, this section, KRS 178.080 or KRS 179.470; however, reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under KRS 179.470 would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under KRS 179.470 before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The establishment of a county road to a community of two (2) or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of a county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The ordinance for the establishment of a road must declare that the project is in the best interests of the county, if the fiscal court believes it is, and the property involved in the improvement must be described sufficiently to put any contesting party on notice thereof; the posting of certified copies of such ordinance is made mandatory by this section and the posting of the ordinance on the road itself is required to be done by the county road engineer. OAG 82-180.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and this section, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a circuit court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal could be taken from a fiscal court order to the district court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in KRS 178.025; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of KRS 178.040(2) had to be complied with. OAG 83-88.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s or general public interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Chapter 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There must validly exist a county right-of-way on both sides of a stream in order for the county to build a bridge across the stream, and there can be no public interest involved where the bridge dead-ends on one piece of private property. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the county has not acquired the necessary right-of-way for a bridge, the fiscal court must do so. OAG 83-267.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 178.116(4), concerning access to closed roads, can be resorted to by the joint petition of all private parties entitled to necessary access, even though the time for appeal of the decision to close a road has expired. OAG 83-304.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under KRS 178.080 and this section, the initial decision as to the construction or altering of any particular county road by the county is not a mandatory function but is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, which body can determine whether or not a proposed project is deemed to be in the best interest of the county so as to constitute the necessity for such road; the “necessity for a road” arises in the context of the county’s condemnation proceedings, once the fiscal court determines that such road construction is in the public interest. OAG 83-323.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section implies that a road segment adopted as a part of the county road system requires any necessary construction and maintenance as a part of the county road system; ordinarily the fiscal court can maintain only those road segments specifically acquired as a part of the county road system. OAG 84-65.

    Obstruction of a lane was improper because it was an open public road instead of a private passway; the location of the public road could not have been altered by the construction or installation of a private drive. A portion of the lane formerly maintained by the county that provided necessary access for a private person continued to serve as an open public road; the lane was not a county road because it had never been adopted as such.

    County road provided “necessary access” to the owners' property within the meaning of this statute because, although the owners had limited permissive use of a passway, this was in stark contrast to their right to reasonable access to the public highway system. While the owners of the property at issue had a temporary means of accessing their property, this limited, permissive easement could not ripen into a permanent, legal right of ingress and egress.

    Lower court erred in concluding that a section of an old road was not an abandoned or discontinued public road where the neighboring landowner had been furnished an alternate route to access his property, there was no practical necessity for the landowner to use the entirety of the old road, and thus, the portion of the old road did not provide the landowner necessary access to his property.

    Subsection (4) of this section, concerning access to closed roads, can be resorted to by the joint petition of all private parties entitled to necessary access even though the time for appeal of the decision to close a road has expired. OAG 83-304.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Unless action is taken under subsection (4) of this section by joint petition wherein the road is closed to the public but remains open to the private parties needing access, the old road bed would revert to the owner or owners of the land out of which the road was built, and a reopening of the road would require the fiscal court to start all over again by condemnation. OAG 83-304.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section requires no formal action of the fiscal court, since the General Assembly has made discontinuance automatic except for the existence of at least one of the described conditions; the statute works by operation of law, not by acts of the fiscal court. OAG 84-358.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 178.070 has no bearing on the discontinuing of a road by operation of law under this section, except that under subsection (4) of this section, where a county road has been discontinued under KRS 178.070, then by a joint petition of all private parties entitled to necessary access, the road shall be closed to public use but remain open in accordance with its condition and use for the access of the private parties affected, or by a joint petition of all parties entitled to necessary access, the road shall revert to the owner or owners of the tract or tracts of land to which it originally belonged.

   <p class="p7">
    The General Assembly did not intend to impose this section upon the authority of a fiscal court to close a county road under KRS 178.070; however, where a county has taken no formal action to discontinue a county road under KRS 178.070, this section would then apply, provided the terms of the latter statute are met.

In considering whether to permit the requested improvement, the fiscal court, the urban-county government, or the consolidated local government, and the county engineer shall follow the same procedures provided for in KRS 184.040 and the same appellate rights provided for in these sections are available to the petitioners. When the county engineer receives from the fiscal court, the urban-county government, or the consolidated local government an application for approval of plans or specifications for the private improvement of publicly dedicated roads by some individual or corporation, or a combination thereof, the county engineer shall be authorized and empowered to examine, inspect, and investigate, as seems to be advisable, the sufficiency of the improvements which the application seeks to serve the purposes intended, and to establish and make reasonable charges for his or her services on the basis of a schedule adjusted according to the services required to conduct the investigation or on any other reasonable method.

    The fiscal court of any county may submit to the voters at a special election to be held for that purpose, the question of voting a tax of any sum not exceeding twenty cents ($0.20) on the hundred dollars ($100) on all property subject by law to local taxation, for the construction of the public roads and bridges of the county, as the fiscal court directs. The order of the fiscal court calling the election shall specify the amount of the tax to be levied each year and the number of years for which the tax may be imposed, not exceeding ten (10) years, and shall also provide that no money in excess of the amount that can be raised by the levy in any one (1) year shall be expended in that year.

    The fiscal court may borrow money and issue bonds therefor in advance of the collection of the tax for any year, but the amount borrowed shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the estimated tax for the year. The amount of the tax shall be estimated according to the assessment and collection of the preceding year. Any money so borrowed shall be paid out of the money raised from the tax in the year in which the money is borrowed.

    The fiscal court can, in its sound discretion, and where such construction is needed, build and maintain suitable areas for the safe turning around of school buses, but the county would have to acquire at least an easement right from affected landowners for such areas sufficient to justify the cost to the county. OAG 72-134.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a school bus must travel two-tenths or three-tenths of a mile from a county road over a private drive to reach an area maintained as a turn around pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the county must acquire the private drive interval by agreement or condemnation, since this section strongly suggests that a turn around is part of the county road system and does not contemplate a private ownership or interval between the county’s road holdings.

    The fiscal court could, with written permission of the city having jurisdiction over a road or street as a city street, construct sidewalks alongside the road or street where needed for school children.

    At any time before the adoption of the county through road system, any freeholder of the county may file a petition with the county road engineer asking for any change in the designated county through roads, setting forth the reason for the proposed change. Such petition shall be accompanied by a plat showing such proposed change. Any such petition shall be considered by the fiscal court or the consolidated local government at its meeting held on the date advertised in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. The fiscal court or the consolidated local government may accept or reject any such suggested changes in the proposed county through road system. The fiscal court or the consolidated local government may continue the consideration to a later meeting which must be advertised as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

    Whenever the fiscal court considers it reasonably necessary for the public safety, it may in the manner hereinafter provided, order any railroad company, either steam or electric, owning or operating a railroad in its county, to eliminate any existing grade crossing or change any existing overhead or underpass structure where any county road crosses the railroad tracks of such company.

    The fiscal court shall give at least ten (10) days’ notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company of a hearing to be held at a time and place stated in the notice, at which hearing it shall consider whether or not the proposed grade separation or change is reasonably necessary and the most advantageous method of effecting the grade separation or change. In determining whether the proposed grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, the fiscal court shall receive evidence of, and shall consider, all relevant facts, including the present and prospective density of highway traffic and the present and prospective frequency and speed of train movements over the crossing, the adequacy of existing or proposed signals or warning devices for the protection of highway traffic at the grade crossings, the possibility and probability of personal injury to the public using the highway and to employees and passengers of the railroad company and damage to property, and the cost of the grade separation or change in relation to benefits resulting from the proposed construction. If the fiscal court finds that the grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, it shall make an order to that effect and furnish a copy thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company. The order shall specify a general plan for the new or changed grade separation. The order shall direct the railroad company to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change in accordance with the general plan prescribed by the order, or may provide that the plans, specifications and estimates of cost shall be prepared by the county if the grade separation structure shall pass over the railroad tracks. The plans, specifications and estimates of cost may, if requested by any public utility, provide facilities for such public utility.

    Within ninety (90) days after the entry of an order directing a grade separation or change, and the preparation of plans, specifications and estimates of cost by the railroad company, the railroad company shall present to the fiscal court, plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change, including the necessary approaches thereto.

    After receipt of the plans, specifications and estimates of cost from the railroad company the fiscal court shall give at least ten (10) days’ notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company of a time and place for final hearing with respect to the grade separation or change. If the fiscal court elects to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost, it shall furnish copies thereof to the railroad company prior to or at the time it gives notice of a final hearing. At the final hearing the fiscal court shall consider whether or not the plans make reasonably adequate provision for present and future safety and convenience of highway traffic and present and future safety and efficiency of operation of trains of the railroad company, its employees and passengers, and for the development of highway and railroad facilities, and shall approve or modify the plans and specifications. It shall then consider and determine the method of doing the work, whether by the railroad company or by the county, or partly by one and partly by the other, and whether by contract or by the employees of the county or the railroad company, or both, or by any combination of these methods, and if by contract, the method and manner of advertising for bids, the time and place of opening the bids, the time when work shall be begun and completed, and all similar matters of an administrative nature.

The fiscal court may reject all bids and elect to do the work itself, or partly by itself and by the railroad company, or by contractors, or by a combination of these methods. If the work includes a structure to support the railroad tracks, the railroad company shall have the right to supervise the construction of that part of the work. If the fiscal court elects to do the work itself there shall not be charged to the railroad company any sum in excess of that it would have been required to pay had the contract been let to the lowest bidder.

Each party shall be afforded reasonable opportunities to verify the statements of expenditures by the other, and the balance due as certified by the county road engineer in his final statement shall be paid by one party to the other promptly upon receipt of such final statement.

    The services of a temporary supervisor of county roads automatically terminate at the end of three (3) months and the county judge (now county judge/executive) and fiscal court are precluded from reappointing him or any other temporary supervisor during the same term of the county judge (now county judge/executive) making the appointment.

    No road supervision work of the county judge (now county judge/executive), whether of a direct or indirect nature, can be set up as an allocable part of the judge’s salary or expenses, paid from the county treasury, and as a pro rata basis for paying such portion of the salary or expenses (attributed to highway work) from the county road fund.

    This section requires that either a road engineer or road supervisor be appointed and be consented to within a reasonable time after the vacancy first occurs and failure to fill the position within a reasonable time will subject the fiscal court to a mandamus action. OAG 70-704.

    A magistrate cannot be paid a fixed monthly compensation for his services rendered by way of inspecting county roads in his district when there is no county road engineer or road supervisor. OAG 70-791.

   <p class="p7">
    As it appears from KRS 179.060 and this section that the county engineer is not a county officer and neither KRS 61.080 nor section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution prohibits a person from holding a form of county employment and a city office or city employment at the same time, there is no incompatibility nor conflict of interest with respect to the city hiring as city engineer the person who is presently serving as county engineer. OAG 74-92.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county judge (now county judge/executive) appoints a county road supervisor subject to the consent of the fiscal court and in case of a tie on the consent it will remain a tie unless someone changes his mind. OAG 74-99.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The appointment of a county road supervisor is covered by this section and not by KRS 67.040(4), the “tie vote” statute, which applies to selection of county officers and employees generally and not to county finance matters. OAG 74-99 (opinion prior to 1978 amendment of KRS 67.040).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the the county judge (now county judge/executive) appoints a county road engineer whom the fiscal court refuses to approve and the judge refuses to make another appointment, the resulting vacancy in the office of county road engineer does not relieve the fiscal court from its mandatory duty under KRS 179.110 (repealed) to employ the necessary persons for the construction and maintenance of county roads and bridges. OAG 75-280.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a fiscal court cannot agree on a candidate for county road engineer appointed by the county judge (now county judge/executive), the duties of road engineer normally should be performed by a county road supervisor appointed by the county judge (now county judge/executive) and if no appointment is made by the judge and approved by the court the position is vacant.

   <p class="p7">
    KRS 67.040 concerning the breaking of tie votes in the fiscal court after fifteen (15) days by the county judge (now county judge/executive) does not apply to the selection of county road engineers and supervisors under this section. OAG 75-280.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a county judge (now county judge/executive) appoints a county road engineer and a majority of the fiscal court refuses to approve the appointment, the fiscal court may not then hire a county road engineer who has not been appointed by the county judge (now county judge/executive). OAG 75-280.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When the fiscal court votes on the county judge/executive’s nominee for road supervisor, the county judge/executive has the right to vote even on his own nominee since he has all the powers of any other member of the fiscal court, including the right to vote on all matters coming before the body. OAG 78-117.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a county road supervisor was hired in 1967 who was otherwise qualified, but who had not been appointed in accordance with the provisions of this section, he was not legally in office but could have been appointed retroactively to meet the requirements of this section, and could have remained in office until his successor was appointed pursuant to this section. OAG 78-430.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A failure to fill the position of road engineer or road supervisor within a reasonable time will subject fiscal court to a mandamus action. OAG 80-541.

   <p class="p7">
    Pending appointment of a road engineer the fiscal court was responsible for seeing to it that the county bridge and road program continued without a break, but would be prohibited from receiving any additional compensation for such temporary work. OAG 80-541.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (5) of this section was designed as a temporary expedient or emergency measure and where the fiscal court had not appointed either a road engineer or road supervisor, the section required the employment of an engineer or supervisor within a reasonable time; the fiscal court’s intent to substitute a committee consisting of the fiscal court members for such appointment on a permanent or indefinite basis was clearly illegal. OAG 80-541.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Supervision by the county judge/executive or a fiscal court committee was intended to be a temporary expedient where no qualifying applicant was found or accepted. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has an option as to whether to hire a county road engineer or a county road supervisor; where a county road engineer is not, for any good reason, hired, the fiscal court must hire a county road supervisor. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The underlying purpose of this section is to provide for the basic continuity of the technical services of a road engineer or supervisor in each county. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section contemplates the appointment of a road engineer or supervisor on a regular full time basis; if the engineer or supervisor works in two (2) or more counties under subsection (6) of this section, he is a full-time employee who divides his time among the contracting counties. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section does not authorize the mere borrowing of another county’s road engineer or supervisor to be used on a consulting basis, the remaining supervisory tasks being assumed by the county judge/executive or fiscal court committee. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When a multi-county road engineer is not working in a particular contracting county, the county judge/executive must supervise the road program without him since the county judge/executive is the overall executive head over the county road program, but the executive role of the county judge/executive was not intended to take the place of a road engineer or supervisor. OAG 80-542.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A magistrate cannot simultaneously serve as a county road supervisor under this section, since the fiscal court controls and establishes the county road program and the magistrate cannot sit on the fiscal court and participate in directing what he is going to do as a county road supervisor. OAG 81-381.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The supervision of the construction and maintenance of county roads by the county judge/executive pursuant to subsection (5) of this section is purely temporary and of an emergency nature; the burden is upon the county judge/executive and the fiscal court to either establish the county road engineer position or the county road supervisor position. OAG 82-22.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The appointment of a county road engineer or county road supervisor is mandatory. OAG 82-142.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The entire fiscal court may be compelled by the Circuit Court through mandamus to appoint a county road supervisor, or other necessary employee, if they arbitrarily refuse to do so. The judicial court will not name the particular person to be appointed. OAG 82-142.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the county judge/executive makes his appointment of a county road supervisor, or other county personnel, the fiscal court as a body cannot arbitrarily withhold its consent. OAG 82-142.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fiscal court has no authority to establish an assistant to the county road supervisor, since the road and bridge function is to be carried out by the county road engineer or county road supervisor, whomever is appointed under this section. The fiscal court may designate some county road employee to assist the county road supervisor, but he may not be considered an assistant county road supervisor in the technical sense, and he can in no way take over or assume the role of the county road supervisor in the latter’s absence. OAG 82-328.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 179.060 provides, in effect, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, that the county judge/executive can remove a county road supervisor, without the consent of the fiscal court. However, it can be said that KRS 67.710(7) amended KRS 179.060 by implication, and KRS 67.710(7) requires the county judge/executive to exercise his authority to remove county personnel with the approval of the fiscal court. OAG 84-205.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no statutory impediment to the county road foreman also being appointed as county building inspector; however, the fiscal court would have to determine factually whether or not the road supervisor could perform both jobs with care and ability, if he could not, then a common-law incompatibility would exist. OAG 84-253.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The phrase “county engineer” as used in former KRS 179.380(1), means county road engineers, and would mean county road supervisor where applicable. OAG 93-24.

    As it appears from KRS 179.020 and this section that the county engineer is not a county officer and neither KRS 61.080 nor section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution prohibits a person from holding a form of county employment and a city office or city employment at the same time, there is no incompatibility nor conflict of interest with respect to the city hiring as city engineer the person who is presently serving as county engineer.

    This section provides, in effect, pursuant to KRS 179.020(2), that the county judge/executive can remove a county road supervisor, without the consent of the fiscal court.

    The trial court’s findings that public right-of-way had always been considered to extend to the fences along roads, that KRS 178.025(2) had merely codified that rule, and thus, that electric lines constructed prior to enactment of statute were originally constructed on public right-of-way, were clearly erroneous since no authorities recognize the presumption set forth in KRS 178.025(2) as a substantive rule, and since former statute in effect at time of construction of the electric lines did not either expressly or by implication create a presumption that all property between a road and the fence lines adjoining it was part of the public right-of-way.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 178.010(2), in counties containing a population between eighty thousand (80,000) and one hundred fifteen thousand (115,000) and a city with a population equal to or greater than twenty thousand (20,000) or in counties containing a city with a population that is less than eight thousand (8,000) and not a city with a population that equals or exceeds eight thousand (8,000), any street or road in an unincorporated area or a city with a population of less than one thousand (1,000) of the county, which is at least two hundred (200) feet in length and dedicated to public use, may be maintained by the fiscal court of the county in the same manner as provided in subsection (1) of this section. In addition, street lights, garbage collection, water, and sewer services may be provided by the fiscal court. The county shall be reimbursed for the cost of such maintenance and services by the abutting property owner whose proportionate share of the cost of maintenance and services shall be added to the owner’s county tax bill and collected in the same manner as county taxes. Further, upon the petition of fifty percent (50%) or more of the abutting property owners of the street or road, the fiscal court may by proper resolution provide for the improvements.

The fiscal court or consolidated local government within thirty (30) days thereafter shall hold a public hearing on the petition.

    Fiscal court’s resolution acquiring a county road and the maintenance thereof resulted in an unauthorized taking because a proper acquisition complying with statutory requirements could not have occurred; however, owners who acquiesced to paving could obtain no recovery, even if they timely filed suit, and were properly directed to remove a gate.

    Although a road segment lying within the boundaries of a sixth-class city may be included in a special services district program established by the county, the legislative body of the city has no authority to turn over any money from its gasoline tax fund or its revenue sharing fund to the fiscal court for maintenance of the city street segment. OAG 76-331.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Concerning the maintenance of a subdivision street or road by the county, the conditions are that the street or road must be at least 200 feet in length and dedicated to public use, and the maintenance must be performed under approval of the county road engineer or the fiscal court under established standards for county roads, as the case may be, and at least 50 percent of the lots abutting the street or road must contain occupied houses. OAG 80-583.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The conventional system of county road acceptance under KRS 178.010(1)(b) and 178.115, and the special acceptance procedure under this section are mutually exclusive; thus a subdivision road may be taken into the county road system by the conventional method, and the provisions of this section would not apply. OAG 80-583.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where a fiscal court, in a county containing a fourth class city, accepts a subdivision road or street for maintenance, including other improvements, such as street lights or garbage collection, it is mandatory that at least 50% of the lots abutting the street or road contain houses which are occupied; and special assessments to recover the county’s cost may be imposed by the county against the benefited property owners where road maintenance or other services, such as street lights and garbage collection, or both street maintenance and other services described in the statute, are involved. OAG 80-583.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Accepting a subdivision road for maintenance or for other described services or both by fiscal court is permissive (not mandatory); however, making the special assessments for subdivision road improvements is mandatory, where this section is used. OAG 80-602.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The fiscal court has the authority to accept a paved road in a subdivision and place the road in the county road system without cost to the owners of lots in the subdivision. OAG 80-602.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section contains no restrictions on the fiscal court’s accepting a “subdivision road” or a “nonsubdivision road” as a part of the county road system pursuant to KRS 178.010(1)(b) and 178.115. OAG 80-602.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a subdivision street is taken over by the county for maintenance pursuant to this section, the fiscal court is responsible for seeing to it that the executive branch of county government maintains files showing the details of the special assessment placed against all abutting property owners; this would include any necessary plats or drawings of each affected lot and a separate file system for each street taken over would be logical. OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In adopting the procedures of this section, special assessments may be imposed under the specific terms of KRS 91A.200 to 91A.290 and the properties subject to assessment for road maintenance are those abutting or contiguous to the road (or both sides of the road). OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (3) of this section would apply where a county contains one city of the fourth class and the rest of the county is basically unincorporated, except for a subdivision located in an unincorporated area of the county just outside the city limits in which subdivision all but two streets have previously been placed on the county road maintenance system and dedicated to public use; however, the subdivision’s streets may be taken into the county road system pursuant to KRS 178.010(1)(a) and 178.115 pursuant to the judgment of the fiscal court and, under this more conventional method, this section would not apply. OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    While subsection (3) of this section mentions that the cost of the maintenance of the roads should be added to the owner’s tax bill, this could not be done, since the special assessment for maintenance of roads is merely a special charge fixed on property to finance an improvement, it is not a tax and could not very often be integrated with the tax billing procedure and the language in a statute must receive a practical construction. OAG 80-636.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The language in subsection (3) of this section “notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 178.010(2)” simply means that the exclusive jurisdiction of the sixth-class city over its streets must give way to the fiscal court where a city street segment is taken into the county road system under this section; the city can, where the county applies this section, be absolved from the duty of maintaining such city street. OAG 80-638.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the county road department agrees to provide maintenance to subdivision streets in return for payments by the residents of the subdivision through the road committee, direct reimbursements are not authorized under KRS 178.010, KRS 178.115, KRS 178.080 or this section; however, the reimbursement of maintenance expenses of subdivision roads through special assessments under this section would be allowed and would accrue to that part of the county road fund allocated for the maintenance of subdivision streets rather than the general road fund; thus, where the fiscal court adopts the road project under this section before the fiscal court finally adopts the budget, the cost of the road project can be set up under a special road account and where the road project is approved by the fiscal court after the budget is approved, the budget would have to be amended under KRS 68.280 to set up the special road project and unanticipated revenue by way of special assessments. OAG 81-19.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Although a county which contains a fourth-class city may maintain any street or road which is at least 200 feet in length, dedicated to public use and located in an unincorporated area of the county pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, there is no statutory requirement for a county fiscal court to appoint trustees to maintain streets in an unincorporated area. OAG 81-169.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The method of assessment to be applied for the county’s maintenance of subdivision roads under this section, including any services of street lights, garbage collection, water and sewer systems, is to be determined through the sound judgment of the fiscal court, which assessment shall be geared to the legislative criterion that the cost of the improvement shall be apportioned equitably on a fair basis. In so using that standard, resort may be had to the use of one or more of the methods outlined in KRS 91A.210, depending upon the nature of the improvement and the general circumstances of property ownership related thereto. OAG 82-527.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    One of the basic conditions for the applicability of this section, as relates to maintenance of subdivision roads in counties, is that the subdivision road segment must have been dedicated to public use and where a subdivision road segment is private, this section can have no application. OAG 84-65.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where subdivision road segment used by public school buses in county containing a fourth-class city had not been acquired as a part of the county’s road system, the fiscal court had no authority to make repairs on that road. OAG 84-65.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, requiring owners of property abutting certain subdivision roads, in certain counties, to reimburse the county for a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance of such roads, remain effective after the 1990 amendment to KRS 100.277(4); accordingly, a county does not assume “legal and financial responsibility” for maintenance of subdivision roads accepted prior to July 1990, if, by “assumption of legal and financial responsibility,” one means assumption of full responsibility for maintenance of such roads, without reimbursement from owners of property abutting them, where subsections (2) and (3) of this section are applicable. OAG 92-52.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The attorney general opined that the 1990 amendment of KRS 100.277(4) does not provide, even in effect, for assumption of “legal and financial responsibility” for maintenance of all subdivision roads accepted prior to July, 1990, under this section, by a fiscal court. OAG 92-52.

    Upon a finding by the fiscal court that there exists an unabated dust nuisance on a county road resulting from the transportation of natural resources by truck, said court may require the producers of the natural resources that are being hauled on said road to treat said road to control dust. Said producer or producers shall be notified of the fiscal court’s finding by certified mail and shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to treat said road to control dust prior to the county fiscal court initiating dust control treatment. The cost of treatment shall be apportioned among all producers of natural resources using said road. If a producer does not pay his proportionate share within sixty (60) days of the mailing of the bill, the fiscal court may prohibit the movement of the producer’s natural resources on county roads until the charges are paid.

    <span class="boldspan">

    The proportionate share of costs of any producer shall be determined as the percentage which the tonnage of natural resources hauled by or for the producer over county roads bears to the total tonnage of natural resources hauled on the county roads. The fiscal court shall consult with producers to devise an equitable method for determining proportionate cost shares before instituting charges, but the fiscal court shall be the final authority in determining proportionate costs.

    The territorial limits of an established subdivision road district, as established pursuant to KRS 179.700 to 179.735 may be enlarged or diminished in the following way: The trustees of the district shall file a petition in the county clerk’s office of the county in which that district and the territory to be annexed or stricken off, or the greater part thereof, is located, describing the territory to be annexed or stricken and setting out the reasons therefor. Notice of the filing of such petition shall be given by publication and posting in the same manner as provided for in KRS 65.182. On the day fixed in the notice, the county judge/executive shall, if the proper notice has been given, and the publication made, and no written objection or remonstrance is interposed enter an order annexing or striking off the territory described in the petition. Fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the freeholders of the territory sought to be annexed or stricken off may, at any time before the date fixed in the notice, remonstrate in writing, filed in the clerk’s office, to the action proposed. If such written remonstrance be filed, the clerk shall properly give notice to the trustees of the subdivision road district and the county judge/executive shall hear and determine the same. If upon such hearing, the county judge/executive finds from the evidence that a failure to annex or strike off such territory will materially retard the functioning of the district and materially adversely affect the owners and the inhabitants of the territory sought to be annexed or stricken off, he shall enter an order, granting the annexation or striking off the territory. In the latter event, no new petition to annex or strike off all or any part of the same territory shall be entertained for a period of two (2) years.

    Where the county airport board and a county airport corporation were sued in a wrongful death action after a plane crash, the trial court properly determined that the airport board and corporation were agencies of the county government under KRS 183.012(2) and were entitled to sovereign immunity.

    Where the county airport board and a county airport corporation were sued in a wrongful death action after a plane crash, the trial court properly determined that the airport board and corporation were agencies of the county government created in accordance with KRS 183.132(1) and entitled to sovereign immunity. By providing essential transportation infrastructure to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the airport board and the airport corporation were exercising a function integral to state government; as such, the organizations and their members could not be held liable in tort.

    A county attorney may be employed as private counsel by a joint city-county air board and the compensation paid him would not be considered as part of the income derived as county attorney. OAG 65-837.

    It is not necessary for a corporation organized pursuant to this section to file articles of incorporation with the secretary of state. OAG 68-238.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Upon the expiration of the term of a member of the joint air board, and the mayor and county judge (now county judge/executive) not being able to agree upon a jointly named successor, the member, whose term expired, will continue in office until his successor is duly appointed and qualified. OAG 70-70.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The city council does not have to approve or affirm the mayor’s actions in the appointment of the members of a city air board. OAG 70-275.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The selection of membership of the air board by the county judges (now county judges/executive) consenting to three (3) members suggested by the mayor and the mayor consenting to three (3) members suggested by the county judge (now county/executive) is a practical and pragmatic method of complying with the appointment requirements of subsection (3)(c) (now (4)(c)) of this statute where the action of one county and one city is involved. OAG 73-670.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    There is no conflict of interest, under KRS 61.210 or 61.220, if a corporation whose president is county magistrate has a contract with a county airport board established under this section as the airport authority is neither a city nor a county board but a separate corporate entity. OAG 74-253.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A county cannot pledge money to an airport board for airport purposes out of the general fund, without the vote of the people as required by Const., § 157, unless the amount pledged can be found within the available income revenue for the fiscal year. OAG 74-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A mayor, as an essential part of the appointing authority, does not have the power to select and submit his name for appointment to membership on the city-county air board. OAG 74-755 (modified by OAG 84-384).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a city-county airport board is an independent corporate entity, neither a city nor a county agency, membership on such board is not an office contemplated by Const., § 165 or KRS 61.080 and is not incompatible with the office of commonwealth’s attorney. OAG 75-72.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A member of the city council may legally serve on the county air board at the same time. OAG 75-238.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Insofar as this section does not expressly prohibit the establishment of two separate local air boards in the same county, a county may establish a second and separate air board despite the existence of another local air board created in joint action with a city, where one airport may be insufficient to serve the needs of all the residents of the county. OAG 76-173.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a city-county air board is a separate political entity from the creating agency, a member of the city council could be appointed to the air board by the mayor. OAG 76-257.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since there is no authorization for the use of proxies by members of the air board created pursuant to this section, the use of proxies by or on behalf of board members would be illegal and a board member must be present at a regular or called meeting in order to cast a valid vote on any subject to be acted upon by the board. OAG 78-235.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Of course the fiscal court has no authority to create an additional membership to the air board of any kind, regardless of whether it is advisory or not, since by attempting to create an advisory member to this board the fiscal court in effect would be attempting to amend this section which establishes the membership of that board. OAG 78-505.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The county judge/executive may legally appoint the county attorney as a member of the county air board. OAG 78-610.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Any appointment to the air board must be made by way of nomination made by the county judge/executive, subject to the approval or disapproval of the nomination by the members of the fiscal court acting as a body. OAG 78-746.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 67.710(8) and subsection (3)(b) (now (4)(b)) of this section are in irreconcilable conflict, and in this situation the later statute should control, and while this section was last amended in 1964, KRS 67.710(8) was passed during the extraordinary session of 1976, and, therefore, 67.710(8) controls. OAG 78-746.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    An airport board is a municipal corporation. OAG 79-240.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since the air board is a public body engaged in the performance of a public duty, without express statutory permission it is not permitted to delegate and surrender to others its official powers which are discretionary in character and require the exercise of judgment. OAG 79-240.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since this section governing local air boards does not expressly prohibit the dissolution of the board by the city establishing it, the city probably can do so under the home rule charter (KRS 82.082) by the enactment of appropriate local legislation even though this chapter does contain a so-called comprehensive scheme of legislation on the general subject. OAG 80-345.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since subsection (10) (now subsection (11)) of this section and KRS 67.710(8) are in conflict as to who removes a member of a county air board, KRS 67.710(8), as the later enactment, prevails and a member of a county air board is removed by the county judge/executive with the approval of the fiscal court; the statutes are not in conflict as to the reasons for removal, however, and a member of a county air board can only be removed by the county judge/executive and the fiscal court for those specific reasons set forth in subsection (10) (now subsection (11)) of this section. OAG 80-403.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where an air board is established by a county, the air board members are nominated by the county judge/executive, subject to the approval of fiscal court as a body under KRS 67.710(8), and since the fiscal court is therefor the appointing authority, a justice of the peace serving on the fiscal court is prohibited by subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section from becoming an air board member. OAG 80-436.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The persistent or chronic absenteeism of a board member in connection with air board meetings constitutes “misconduct” under subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section; thus where a member has been persistently absent from the meetings without excuse, the mayor and county judge/executive may, after conducting a hearing on the question of absences, and after determining that the member missed three (3) consecutive meetings without any justifiable cause or excuse, remove and replace the offending member under the subject by-law of the air board and subsection (10) (now (17)) of this section. OAG 80-469.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In the absence of legislative guidelines of the general assembly, an air board cannot be dissolved or discontinued. OAG 80-556.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Where the air board repeatedly, and as a definite pattern, and over a substantial period of time holds meetings resulting in a tie vote, thus resulting in a failure to carry out its statutory duties, the fiscal court may file a mandamus action in circuit court against the board, seeking a judgment compelling the members to perform merely ministerial duties or to direct that its discretionary duties be performed, though not to direct the particular manner of the performance of a discretionary duty. OAG 80-556.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a city-county air board is entrusted with the control and custody of public funds, the officers of the air board must comply with the provisions of KRS 424.220 concerning the preparation and publication of an annual financial statement. OAG 80-577.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    For the purpose of legal advertisements, the “publication area” for the Kenton County airport board is Kenton County, inasmuch as the operation of the Kenton County airport, though conducted in the main in Boone County, is an official activity of the airport board, which was created by Kenton County and which is derivatively a board of Kenton County. OAG 80-584.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Persons appointed to fill vacancies on local air boards pursuant to subsection (4) (now (8)) of this section can only serve throughout the remainder of the unexpired term of their predecessors and would, under no circumstances, serve full four-year terms calculated from the date of their appointment. OAG 81-348.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A regional airport board created by four counties acting jointly may be expanded from a six-member board to a ten (10) member board; if the four fiscal courts vote to expand the board membership to ten, then the ten (10) members shall be appointed by the joint action of the county judge/executives of the participating counties, without the necessity for approval by the respective fiscal courts, as a body, of the member counties. OAG 84-269.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since an airport board is a joint board, it is a hybrid agency authorized by statute between the cities and county; thus, a municipal officer could be appointed to such board without violating the prohibition against a municipal officer holding any other municipal, county or state office at the same time, contained in KRS 61.080 and Const., § 165, provided the appointment is made jointly by the mayor of the other city and the county judge/executive, and the appointee is not present during the voting. OAG 84-384, modifying OAG 74-755.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Airport authority, as the air board, has the authority to establish and fix reasonable charges or fees, to be applied to UPS, for the rendition of emergency service involving UPS aircraft rendered either on the airfield or UPS ramps, either for an annual fee, or on a per occasion basis. OAG 85-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the explicit language of KRS 183.476, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps. OAG 85-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Fiscal court’s motion limiting to two the number of consecutive terms that members of the airport board, library board, water commission, district board of health, planning commission and parks and recreation board might serve was illegal, since there is no statutory authority for such action. While KRS 173.340 and 212.855 impose a limit on consecutive terms, as relate to a library board and a district board of health, the General Assembly has established no policy limiting the number of consecutive terms for members of the other boards and commissions, and there is no statutory authority for the fiscal court’s enacting such a policy as relates to the four bodies not covered by statute. OAG 85-116.

    The Airport Authority, as the air board, has the authority to establish and fix reasonable charges or fees, to be applied to UPS, for the rendition of emergency service involving UPS aircraft rendered either on the airfield or UPS ramps, either for an annual fee, or on a per occasion basis. OAG 85-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the explicit language of this section, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the Authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

    The Airport Authority, as the air board, has the authority to establish and fix reasonable charges or fees, to be applied to UPS, for the rendition of emergency service involving UPS aircraft rendered either on the airfield or UPS ramps, either for an annual fee, or on a per occasion basis. OAG 85-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Under the explicit language of KRS 183.476, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the Authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

    Since a public road district can only be established by a person or a group of persons owning property abutting upon a public road (which is neither a county road nor a state road) public road districts within a county may not be combined into one big road district involving all of the unincorporated portion of the county.
