    The General Assembly finds that activities involving the use and exhibition of farm animals are engaged in by a large number of citizens of Kentucky and that these activities also attract to Kentucky a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Kentucky. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in working with, exhibiting, and using farm animals which should be understood by participants in farm animal activities and which are essentially impossible for owners of farm animals or sponsors of farm animal activities to eliminate, it is the purpose of KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 to define the areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall be responsible, to specify risks of injury for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall not be responsible, and to specify areas of responsibilities of farm animal participants. Therefore, the General Assembly determines that to preserve and promote the long Kentucky tradition of activities involving farm animals and the health and safety of the citizens of Kentucky and visitors to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 are necessary to instruct persons voluntarily engaging in farm animal activities of the potential risks inherent in the activities.

Furthermore, KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 establish the policy that the sponsor, instructor, or other professional engaged in farm animal activities who breaches a duty to a farm animal activity participant and causes foreseeable injury to the participant shall be responsible for the injury in accordance with other applicable law.

    It was inappropriate for the appellate court to contradict Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 247.4015 and suggest liability for allegedly raising or waving one’s arms, as the statute includes “sudden movements” within the definition of “inherent risks of farm animal activities” assumed by farm animal activity participants like plaintiff. Consequently, no genuine issue of material fact existed as to defendants’ liability under the statute. Daugherty v. Tabor, 554 S.W.3d 319, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 277 (Ky. 2018).

    specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule
    is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for
    in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows:

    As a consequence of the disparity between the numbers of eligible producers voting in successive referenda required to adopt and to terminate or discontinue the assessment program, the votes of those producers who favor the assessment program is accorded substantially greater weight than votes of those persons in the same class of producers who are opposed to the program; thus the terms and conditions of KRS 247.780(1) effectively operate to deny the producers of burley tobacco who are opposed to an assessment program the equal protection of the law required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and the same contravenes Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 59; said subsection of the act is, therefore, discriminatory and void. Tabor v. Council for Burley Tobacco, Inc., 599 S.W.2d 466, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 319 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).

    KRS 247.710 to 247.785 is limited in scope to burley tobacco produced and sold in Kentucky by Kentucky farmers and thus is purely intrastate in scope and, therefore, tobacco produced in Kentucky but marketed out of the State and tobacco produced out of the State and marketed in Kentucky cannot be included in determining market quotas (checkoff) for assessment purposes under this section.

    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that as a result of a variety of pressures, most notably the continual spiral of inflation and the increasingly serious effects of speculative land values, the opportunities in agriculture have been severely limited; that one of the major impediments to the purchase of agricultural land, machinery and equipment by farmers is their inability to secure adequate financing upon reasonable terms; and, that it is both necessary and desirable to institute policies and programs which will encourage agricultural pursuits from which the Commonwealth derives the numerous social, economic and environmental benefits which historically have proved beneficial to its citizens.

    The General Assembly finds that the Tobacco Price Support Program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 U.S.C. sec. 1314 is the best and most efficient means of preserving the economic health of thousands of tobacco farms throughout the United States and throughout Kentucky. Based upon this finding, the General Assembly declares that the Tobacco Task Force shall study methods to support the Tobacco Price Support Program and its continuing role in the economic viability of Kentucky’s small tobacco farmer.

   <p class="p8">
    In view of the fact that tobacco warehouses are public warehouses and in view of legislation which grants the department of agriculture power to license, supervise and regulate such warehouses, agents of the department are authorized to examine the records of tobacco warehouses. OAG 76-175.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A warehouseman can offer such a service as lending money to tobacco growers only when such a service is extended to all those growers using his warehouse, and failure to do so violates this section. OAG 78-536.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    It would appear to be a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of subsection (1) of this section for a tobacco warehouse to charge a lower commission to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the bale method than it charges to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the tied method since the general assembly has eliminated flexibility and precluded the utilization of reasonable classifications in connection with the sale of tobacco by tobacco warehouses.

   <li class="p6">
    There is established in the State Treasury a fund to be known as the “Rural Development Fund.” This fund shall exist for the purpose of receipt and expenditure of moneys to improve and promote agricultural development for residents of the Commonwealth. The fund may receive state appropriations, gifts, grants, and federal funds and shall be disbursed by the State Treasurer upon the warrant of the chair of the rural development board. Before and after July 1, 2000, fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds in the tobacco settlement agreement fund shall be deposited in this fund as provided under KRS 248.654. All investment income earned from moneys deposited in the fund shall accrue to the fund. The moneys in the fund shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year but shall be carried forward in the next fiscal year for the purpose of the fund. The board shall develop and oversee the implementation of a strategic plan. The strategic plan shall identify both short-term and long-term goals and the appropriate oversights to measure progress toward achievement of those goals, and it shall be updated every two (2) years. The board shall submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislative Research Commission by September 1 of each year for the preceding fiscal year, outlining its activities and expenditures. The Auditor of Public Accounts, on an annual basis, shall conduct a thorough review of all expenditures from the fund and, if necessary in the opinion of the Auditor, an audit of the operations of the fund. No money in the fund shall be allocated until the board has adopted a strategic plan.

    (3/20/2017).
    2017 Ky. Acts ch. 45 contained 13 sections. Sections 1 to 10 of that Act amended, repealed and reenacted, or created statutes relating to the industrial hemp research program found in the statutory range of
    KRS 260.850 to
    260.869. Sections 11 and 12 amended or created statutes in other KRS chapters, and Section 13 repealed some statutes within
    KRS 260.850 to
    260.869. The correct reference should have been to only Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, the relevant range affecting the industrial hemp research program, and in codification the Reviser of Statutes has codified that language in this statute accordingly under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1)(h) to correct manifest clerical or typographical errors.

    Defendant’s convictions for manufacturing methamphetamine under KRS 218A.1432(1)(a) and anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine under KRS 250.489(1) did not violate double jeopardy because the former made no mention of anhydrous ammonia or what constituted a proper container for it; thus, on its face there was proof of an element required for a conviction of the latter offense that was not required for a conviction of the former. Further, while manufacturing methamphetamine required that the defendant acted in the past, proving that the defendant possessed the anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine in the future required proving how the defendant was going to act; thus, the two crimes did not constitute a “continuing course of conduct” and did not violate double jeopardy.

   <p class="p8">
    Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine because although the liquid anhydrous ammonia found in the freezer was not tested, the contents of the propane tank field-tested positive for anhydrous ammonia and a detective testified that the charge of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container was based on the anhydrous ammonia found in the propane tank, not the contents of the bowl found in the freezer. Furthermore, the fact that a manufacturing process was ongoing at the time of the search and that numerous other chemicals and items of equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were found nearby, created a reasonable inference that defendant intended to use the anhydrous ammonia to manufacture methamphetamine.

    When the director has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of KRS 250.491 to 250.631 or of any of the prescribed administrative regulations under KRS 250.491 to 250.631, he may issue and enforce a written or printed “withdrawal from distribution” order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the director or the court. The director shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when the statutes and administrative regulations have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within thirty (30) days, the director may begin, or upon request of the distributor or registrant shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.

    Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with statutes and administrative regulations shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the director to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which the feed is located. In the event the court finds the commercial feed to be in violation of KRS 250.491 to 250.631 and orders its condemnation, the feed shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with its quality and the laws of the state. However, in no instance shall the disposition of the feed be ordered by the court without first giving the owner an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the feed or for permission to process or relabel the feed to bring it into compliance with KRS 250.491 to 250.631.

   <p class="p8">
    KRS 250.991(2) refers to an enhanced penalty for a “subsequent offense” without defining it. In that circumstance, the Supreme Court of Kentucky has always interpreted such language to require a conviction-to-offense sequence, i.e., the second offense must occur after conviction of the first offense. The rationale behind this interpretation is that after punishment is imposed for the commission of a crime, the double penalty is held in terrorem over the criminal, for the purpose of effecting his reformation, and preventing further and subsequent offenses by him; the Supreme Court of Kentucky adopts this interpretation for subsequent offenses prosecuted under KRS 250.991(2). Fulcher v. Commonwealth, 149 S.W.3d 363, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 274 (Ky. 2004), overruled in part, Ballinger v. Commonwealth, 459 S.W.3d 349, 2015 Ky. LEXIS 1611 (Ky. 2015).

    It is declared to be in the public interest and highly advantageous to the agricultural economy of the Commonwealth that producers of fund-covered grains delivered to licensed grain dealers and licensed grain warehouse operators shall be assessed at a rate of .0025 times the gross value of the fund-covered grain. The board or the department shall provide for the collection of the assessment, under the provisions of this section, for the purpose of financing the Kentucky grain insurance fund, which is hereby created. Assessments shall be levied only on fund-covered grains.

    Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, beginning on or after August 1, 2019, all persons in this state who are licensed grain dealers or licensed grain warehouse operators shall deduct the levied assessment from each producer’s payment for fund-covered grain. The total assessment collected by each licensee shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the month in which the grains are sold to the purchaser, be remitted to the grain insurance fund. The books and records shall clearly indicate the producer assessment and shall be open for inspection by the board or the department. The board or the department may take steps as are reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of books and records of purchasers of grain.

If the board receives notification the fund is less than three million dollars ($3,000,000), then the board shall within sixty (60) days reinstate the assessment fee of .0025 times the gross value of the fund-covered grain purchased. Assessments shall continue until the board certifies the fund is in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000).

    No later than April 30 of each year, the board shall meet and certify the amount in the fund. If the board certifies the fund’s current balance is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000), then no assessment shall be levied. If, at any time after the board has certified that the balance in the fund is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000), the board receives notification that the fund balance is less than six million dollars ($6,000,000), then the board shall reinstate the assessment within sixty (60) days.

    In Chapter 12 case, brand placed on cattle by leasing party was not sufficient to establish ownership over party with security interest because brand was not registered and did not become part of state report until after bankruptcy petition was filed.

   <p class="p8">
    Bankruptcy court properly concluded that a lessor did not own any of the cattle at the time of an auction because, all the cattle were delivered to the debtor, incorporated into his operation, were being fed, cared for, and producing milk before the lessor had signed a lease with the debtor, the leases at issue were found to be true leases, and the bankruptcy court did not violate the mandate rule by holding an evidentiary hearing to determine who owned the cattle that were auctioned, and, even if the lessor was correct as to the legal application of the branding statute, 289 out of 415 cattle bore two indicia of ownership at the time of the auction, which the bankruptcy court determined was inconclusive and “not probative” of ownership.

    Circuit court’s order granting summary judgment in property owners’
    suit under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act was vacated because, pursuant to KRS 256.042, the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over all actions arising under the Act; thus, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the owners’
    claim. Since the owners’
    claim under the Act was anchored in the district court, the neighbor’s counterclaim and the owners’
    common law claims, if any, should be addressed in the district court alongside the owners’
    claim under the Act. Abell v. Reynolds, 191 S.W.3d 1, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 95 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

   <p class="p8">
    Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act consists of two substantive statutes, KRS 256.030 and KRS 256.042, and these statutes make clear that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the act; however KRS 24A.120(1), which provides a general grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court in civil matters, specifically excludes from the purview of the district court matters affecting title to real estate. As such, a district court erred in not only determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act but in also determining the location of the boundary line itself because such a determination is clearly beyond the bounds of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction. Parsley v. McCauley, 338 S.W.3d 290, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 206 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

    suit under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act was vacated because, pursuant to KRS 256.042, the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over all actions arising under the Act; thus, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the owners’
    claim. Since the owners’
    claim under the Act was anchored in the district court, the neighbor’s counterclaim and the owners’
    common law claims, if any, should be addressed in the district court alongside the owners’
    claim under the Act. Abell v. Reynolds, 191 S.W.3d 1, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 95 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

   <p class="p8">
    Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act consists of two substantive statutes, KRS 256.030 and KRS 256.042, and these statutes make clear that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the act; however KRS 24A.120(1), which provides a general grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court in civil matters, specifically excludes from the purview of the district court matters affecting title to real estate. As such, a district court erred in not only determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act but in also determining the location of the boundary line itself because such a determination is clearly beyond the bounds of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction. Parsley v. McCauley, 338 S.W.3d 290, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 206 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

    Railroad is bound to erect and maintain fence along one-half of division line, as required by this section, without written notice being given by landowner as provided in

    “Cattle guard” means such an appliance as will prevent animals from escaping from inclosures and crossing railroad tracks into lands of others adjoining the right-of-way. Any neglect of railroad to keep cattle guards in proper condition for this purpose renders it liable for any injuries that may result therefrom, but cattle guards need not be so constructed that cattle can pass over them with safety as this would defeat purpose of their requirement.

Parrish v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 126 Ky. 638, 104 S.W. 690, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 1020, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 83 (Ky. 1907).

    The administration of rabies vaccines is the practice of veterinary medicine pursuant to KRS 321.181(5)(a). However, the legislature in its power to regulate the health and safety of its citizens has authorized in KRS 258.015 and subsection (4) of this section two limited exceptions granting certain individuals temporary permits to administer rabies shots to dogs. OAG 92-155.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Since the law requires that all dogs over four months old be given a rabies vaccine administered by a veterinarian or a qualified person pursuant to this section and KRS 258.015 and after the initial rabies vaccine, a dog must be re-vaccinated at the expiration of the immunization period as certified by the veterinarian. A dog owner is not exempted by virtue of KRS 321.200(1)(b) from the requirement that the dog must have a current rabies vaccination administered by either a veterinarian or other qualified person.

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Parent of one of the dog owners, who was waiting by request at the owners’
    residence for an animal control officer to arrive and take the dog, was a statutory owner under KRS 258.095(5) when the parent saw the officer in a truck parked two blocks away from the owners’
    house, walked up to the truck with the dog, and motioned for the officer to get out of the truck. However, the officer did not become an owner of the dog for then getting out of the truck. Fetchko v. Morgan, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 195 (Ky. Ct. App. June 27, 2008), review denied, ordered not published, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. Feb. 11, 2009).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.095(5) of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS 258.235(4) because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 83 (Ky. 2012).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 83 (Ky. 2012).

    County ordinance that banned the possession of pit bull terriers was not invalid.

    While the state imposes a license fee on dogs pursuant to this section, there is nothing under the state dog act prohibiting a city from also imposing a license fee and from regulating dogs. In fact, KRS 258.365 provides, in effect, that nothing under the act shall be construed to prohibit or limit the right of any city to pass or enforce any ordinance regulating dogs, the provisions of which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. OAG 71-160.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Under this section and KRS 258.195, a county dog warden paid by the fiscal court a salary of $1,200 per year is entitled to retain the sum of 25¢ for each dog license issued and, in addition, if he operates the county dog pound at his own expense, he is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses actually so incurred in addition to his salary and the 25¢ fees he is entitled to retain. OAG 73-557.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    An operator of a pet store who sells dogs under a permit from a city must also comply with state requirements pertaining to the licensing of dogs by obtaining from the dog warden a license under this section for each dog six (6) months old or over owned or kept by him or he must obtain a kennel license from the dog warden pursuant to former KRS 258.165 (now repealed) for the dogs required to be licensed under this section. OAG 74-699.

   <p class="p8">
    The department of agriculture, with the approval of the Governor, could authorize members of 4-H clubs throughout the state to act as agents of the department for the purpose of selling dog licenses and receive for such services a 25¢ fee for each license sold. OAG 77-578.

    The fiscal court can require the dog warden to pick up dogs that are unlicensed and running loose upon the public ways in the city as well as in the county, particularly under a contract with the city. OAG 70-492.

   <p class="p8">
    Under this section and KRS 258.135, a county dog warden paid by the fiscal court a salary of $1,200 per year is entitled to retain the sum of 25¢ for each dog license issued and, in addition, if he operates the county dog pound at his own expense, he is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses actually so incurred in addition to his salary and the 25¢ fees he is entitled to retain.

    This section would not apply to a city dog warden, which is a position created solely by ordinance. OAG 74-320.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A dog warden appointed by the fiscal court is not a peace officer, unless separately made so by, for example, being appointed a deputy sheriff, and has no power of arrest, unless made a peace officer, to enforce the provisions of the dog laws, although the fiscal court may require him to seize unlicensed dogs running at large as well as to perform other duties not inconsistent with the dog laws or in conflict with other statutory provisions. OAG 75-383; OAG 82-597.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The word “shall” as used in subsection (1) of this section is mandatory and thus the fiscal court is required to employ a dog warden and establish and maintain a dog pound. OAG 78-756.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Subsection (1) of this section provides in part that the fiscal court of each county shall employ a dog warden and that the fiscal court of each county shall establish and maintain a dog pound, and since the word “shall” is mandatory, the fiscal court is required to employ a dog warden and to establish and maintain a dog pound. OAG 79-161.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    While there are no express statutory provisions in this section requiring the county dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers may require the dog warden to pick up such dogs that are unlicensed and loose upon the public way and if the dog warden has been so instructed by the fiscal court, the service should be supplied to the entire county and not just to unincorporated areas, particularly where the city or cities in the county do not have a dog ordinance. OAG 79-161.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    While the state department of agriculture does have certain responsibilities in connection with this chapter, the fiscal court, and not the department, is responsible for the appointment of a dog warden and the establishment and maintenance of a dog pound. OAG 79-161.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A city cannot, through a city ordinance, impose duties and responsibilities on the county dog warden since his basic duties are set forth in KRS Chapter 258 and any additional duties could only be imposed by the fiscal court. OAG 80-330.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the county dog pound is located on the private premises of the county dog warden pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the dog warden, as a minor county officer, is required to make his facilities available to the public for the transaction of legitimate business activities at least five (5) days a week for seven to eight (8) hours per day, as required by KRS 61.160. OAG 81-251.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Counties may enact ordinances relative to dog control but whether they do or not, they must fulfill their statutory obligations as set forth in KRS Chapter 258. While cities have the authority to enact dog control measures they cannot impose obligations upon a county which the county does not agree to and which are in excess of the county’s duties and obligations under the provisions of KRS Chapter 258. OAG 82-447.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The county has definite and prescribed obligations under KRS Chapter 258 but they do not include the duty to accept dogs at its pound picked up by municipal dog control authorities, particularly where violations of municipal ordinances are involved. While the cities and the county have the authority to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement concerning dog control and the use of the county dog pound, which could include a boarding fee for dogs delivered to the pound by city dog control officers, the cities, in the absence of an agreement with the county, cannot require the county to accept dogs picked up for violations of municipal ordinances; absent an agreement between the cities and the county relative to dog control, the cities will enforce their ordinances only, and the county and all peace officers will enforce the provisions of KRS Chapter 258. OAG 82-447.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Neither this section nor any other section of KRS Chapter 258 makes a dog warden a peace officer and, therefore, he does not possess the powers of a peace officer; he could be made a peace officer by being appointed, for example, a deputy sheriff but such an appointment could not involve an increase in the number of deputy sheriff positions beyond the number established by the fiscal court pursuant to KRS 64.530. OAG 82-597.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Since a dog warden does not possess the power of a police officer unless he is made a peace officer by being appointed as such, a dog warden who has not acquired the status of a peace officer cannot utilize the provisions of KRS 431.015 and has no legal authority to issue a citation. OAG 82-597.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    While there are no express statutory provisions requiring the dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers under this section could require the dog warden to pick up such dogs as are unlicensed and loose upon the public way; however, a dog warden has no authority to enter upon private premises for the purpose of picking up an owner’s unlicensed dog without a warrant. OAG 82-597.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    While there are no express statutory provisions requiring the dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers under KRS 258.195 may require the dog warden to pick up unlicensed or unidentified dogs found running at large. OAG 83-209.

    A city ordinance providing that any dog without a proper license tag or other legible identification and which is found running at large may be seized by a peace officer is valid under this section, but such ordinance should also contain a provision, in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, requiring that unlicensed dogs that are picked up be impounded for seven days before they are destroyed.

    Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.235(4) of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS 258.095(5) because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it.

    Although landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.235(4) of a tenant’s dog, they were not liable under KRS 258.095(5) for injuries a minor sustained when attacked by the dog because the dog attack occurred off the premises, and liability could only arise for attacks occurring on or about the premises.

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed.

    Assumption of risk doctrine did not apply to a situation where: (1) an animal control officer, who was responding to a call to pick up a dog that had bitten someone, parked the officer’s truck two blocks from the residence of the dog owners; (2) the parent of one of the owners saw the truck and walked the dog to the truck; (3) the parent motioned for the officer to get out of the truck; (4) the officer, not knowing who the parent was or that the dog was the one for which the officer had come, got out of the truck; and (5) the dog bit the officer.

    Summary judgment was properly granted for an insurer in an action under KRS 258.235(4) by the mother of a child that was attacked by an insured’s dog because the insured’s homeowner’s policy was unambiguous and barred coverage for a claim against the insured, who was watching child while pursuing a business interest in a home day care facility.

    A police officer has authority to kill a dog on private property when he has entered the private property to investigate a report that the dog has bitten a child outside the private property and the dog attacks the police officer and, because of the provisions of KRS 258.245 exempting police officers from its provisions, he may do so even though the dog bears a license tag for the current year.

    A dog warden appointed under a county animal control program and having county wide peace officer powers by virtue of his being a deputy sheriff has the power to enforce the respective dog ordinances of cities that are members of the program. OAG 74-122.

    City ordinance that provided that dogs must be chained or secured between sunset and sunrise to prevent them running at large and that owners must keep their dogs under their personal control at all times to prevent them from trespassing on and destroying and damaging property is a valid ordinance and complies with the State dog law and the terms of this section. OAG 78-260.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    If a city has an ordinance regulating dogs under the authority of this section, it could enter into a contract with the humane society for the establishment and joint operation of a dog pound within or without the city, or at least a contract for its use upon construction, and appropriate public funds for such purpose.

    Where cattle are roaming over a road which is not a county road, the owner of the cattle claims fee simple ownership of the road, and the cattle are contained on the landowner’s premises, including the road, by means of cattle guards, whether this section has been violated or not depends on the status of the road. If it is in fact the private property of the cattle’s owner, there is no violation; on the other hand, if the road has attained the status of a public road, then the other property owners along the road may have a cause of action.

     Southern Dairy Compact. [Effective upon contingency — See compiler’s note.]

   <li class="p6">
    The Southern Dairy Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

    <span class="boldspan">
     History.

     ARTICLE I STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Section 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the region’s rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual, state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal orders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders.

Such compact over-order price shall not exceed one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per gallon at Atlanta, Georgia; however, this compact over-order price shall be adjusted upward or downward at other locations in the region to reflect differences in minimum federal order prices. Beginning in 1990, and using that year as a base, the foregoing one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per gallon maximum shall be adjusted annually by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. For purposes of the pooling and equalization of an over-order price, the value of milk used in other use classifications shall be calculated at the appropriate class price established pursuant to the applicable federal order or state dairy regulation and the value of unregulated milk shall be calculated in relation to the nearest prevailing class price in accordance with and subject to such adjustments as the commission may prescribe in regulations.

    The commission may establish a compact over-order price for milk to be paid by pool plants and partially regulated plants. The commission also may establish a compact over-order price to be paid by all other handlers receiving milk from producers located in a regulated area. This price shall be established either as a compact over-order price or by one or more commission marketing orders. Whenever such a price has been established by either type of regulation, the legal obligation to pay such price shall be determined solely by the terms and purpose of the regulation without regard to the situs of the transfer of title, possession, or any other factors not related to the purposes of the regulation and this compact. Producer-handlers as defined in an applicable federal market order shall not be subject to a compact over-order price.

     Purpose of soil and water conservation district — Methods of achieving purpose.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    The purpose of a soil and water conservation district is to conserve and develop all renewable natural resources within the district. In so doing, the district is authorized to undertake, sponsor, or participate in projects and activities which promote the conservation, development, maintenance and use of the land, water, trees and other renewable natural resources of the district. Such projects and activities shall include but not be limited to conservation practices on agricultural lands, the control of soil erosion, retardation of water runoff, the construction of flood prevention and control reservoirs, the maintenance of flood plains, the promotion of projects to assure an adequate municipal, industrial and agricultural supply of water, watershed stabilization, the avoidance and abatement of sedimentation and pollution in streams and other bodies of water, forestation and reforestation, the establishment of parks and outdoor recreation areas, the protection of open space, greenbelt areas and scenery, the preservation of wilderness areas, the protection of fish and wildlife, working for the location of highways, industries, housing developments, airports and other structures as are consistent with the district’s objectives and will offer the least possible interference with the conservation and best multiple use of the renewable natural resources, and all other activities consistent with the total natural resources development of the district.

Should a fiscal court fail to approve a requested budget, it shall present a specific list of objections and suggested corrections to the board in writing and within a reasonable time. If a budget request is not approved, the board may submit a revised budget request. Funds for an approved budget shall be supplied either from general funds or from the levy of a millage tax on all real property within the boundaries of the county. The tax shall be collected in the same manner as other county taxes, and shall be credited to the board. The funds so collected shall be expended by the board for the employment of soil conservation aids and for other purposes directly associated with the program, including promotional activities, prize moneys, office equipment and supplies, and incidentals deemed necessary.

   <p class="p8">
    Since levying a tax under this section was a nonjudicial act of the fiscal court, the court could rescind its order so long as no contract right was involved. OAG 62-671.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A soil conservation district could not be held liable for a $10.00 license fee required by ordinance to be paid by employers before the commencement of business. OAG 62-1014.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A watershed conservancy district, being a subdistrict of a soil conservation district, is a governmental subdivision of the state and a public body exercising public power. OAG 63-637.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A county soil conservation district board may request and the fiscal court of such county may levy a tax of two cents ($0.02) per acre, even though such tax rate is an increase from the rate levied in previous years. OAG 67-346.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The offices of city treasurer and county soil and water conservation district supervisor under subsection (2) of this section are not incompatible. OAG 71-230.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    This section, as amended in 1972 by ch. 99, § 3, seems to indicate from the use of the term “upon” that the fiscal court has the option of examining the budget of the board and that the budget provisions must be agreed to by the fiscal court and the board and it is only after formal approval of the budget by the court that it becomes mandatory upon it to provide the necessary operating funds. OAG 72-335.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A school board member may not serve on a soil conservation district board of supervisors. OAG 72-683.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The available funds derived pursuant to this section and the funds and assets transferred from a defunct district must first be expended for proper maintenance of present improvements as provided in KRS 262.793(2) but the excess each year, if any, may be used for existing and new improvements and practices as provided in KRS 262.793(1). OAG 74-596.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A soil and water conservation district is a separate governmental subdivision of the state, a public body corporate and politic and does not constitute a municipality, county or agency of state government. OAG 79-149.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Under this section, as amended in 1980, once the district board’s budget has been submitted to and finally approved by the fiscal court, it is mandatory that the fiscal court fund the budget either from the county’s general fund or by levying the millage ad valorem tax, not to exceed $25,000 for a fiscal year, because subsection (4) of this section says that the funds “shall be supplied;” since the millage ad valorem tax is not a voted levy, and since the tax is characterized by subsection (4) of this section as a “county tax,” the roll-back restrictions of KRS 68.245 apply. OAG 80-260.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The county sheriff is authorized under KRS 262.770 to pursue delinquent soil and water conservation district taxes just as he would in the case of delinquent state and county taxes, including advertising the sale of delinquent tax claims under former KRS 134.440 (now repealed), since these taxes are considered county taxes under this section. OAG 81-112.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The amendment of subsection (4) of this section to limit the maximum total tax revenue from real property millage tax to $25,000 per year does not unconstitutionally impact upon KRS 132.023, since the General Assembly may constitutionally levy rates which lessen taxes. OAG 81-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where a soil conservation district had previously levied a real property tax on all taxable real estate parcels of five (5) acres or more, the amendment of subsection (4) of this section to tax all real property would not, as applied, distinguish between old and new property, including houses and lots under five acres. OAG 81-174.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Funds derived from a soil conservation tax imposed under this section are not included in the computation of the 4% increase in revenue permitted under KRS 68.245. Since the soil and water conservation tax is not subject to KRS 68.245, it necessarily follows that the revenue it produces should not be included in the calculations of permissible rates for other taxes that are subject to KRS 68.245. OAG 92-113.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The tax authorized by this section is not subject to the rate rollback provisions of KRS 68.245. Since this section’s tax already contains its own rollback provision, there is no need to subject it to the additional rollback mechanism in KRS 68.245. To do so would render the expressed $25,000 ceiling in this section meaningless. OAG 92-113 (overruling OAG 80-260 to the extent of conflict).

    In view of the broad powers and purposes given to soil and water conservation districts by KRS 262.020 and the narrow scope of authority granted to watershed conservancy districts by KRS 262.700 through KRS 262.990, it would appear that the former have stronger authority to employ engineers for the purpose of determining whether a specific proposed regional garbage disposal landfill will pollute the water of the watershed so as to interfere with existing water uses and to testify as to their findings in related legal proceedings.

    A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3). A watershed conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on its own behalf, since KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3) have no application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district has received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors of the soil conservation district pursuant to KRS 262.745.

    A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3). A watershed conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on its own behalf, since KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3) have no application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district has received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors of the soil conservation district pursuant to this section.

The board shall prepare a record summarizing the proceedings. If the board of directors determines as a result of the hearing that the proposal should be carried out as planned, it may make such changes or revisions in the resolution as it deems proper and shall give due notice of an election to be held at which benefited landowners may vote on the question of annual special assessments to defray the cost.

The board of directors may provide for a meeting of the landowners at which the vote may be cast, in which case qualified voters may vote by absentee vote.

Any owner of property to be benefited by the project may, within forty (40) days after publication of such notice, file an action in the Circuit Court of the county in which his lands are located seeking relief by declaratory judgment or injunction. If a suit is filed, the county attorney shall represent the board of directors in upholding the validity of the proposed assessment.

The board shall prepare a record summarizing the proceedings. If the board of directors determines as a result of the hearing that the project should be carried out as planned, it may make such changes or revisions in the resolution as it deems proper and shall give due notice of an election to be held at which benefited landowners may vote on the question of annual special assessments to defray the cost of the project.

The annual rate of such assessments shall be fixed when other taxes of the district are levied and shall be sufficient in each year to provide for the payment of such bonds and interest coupons as they mature and sufficient to provide a fund equal to twenty percent (20%) of the average annual principal and interest requirements, the same to constitute a “debt service reserve” as a precaution against possible default by failure to collect annual levies. The bonds shall state on their face that they do not constitute a debt of the district but are payable solely from collection of special assessments made upon benefited lands lying in the watershed conservancy district.

    “Viable agriculture land” means land suitable for agricultural production and which will continue to be economically feasible for use if real estate taxes, farm use restrictions, and interference with and constraints on normal farming operations are limited to levels approximating those in commercial agricultural areas not influenced by the proximity of urban and related nonagricultural development.

     Acquisition of agricultural conservation easements by Commonwealth.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    The Commonwealth is hereby authorized to acquire agricultural conservation easements or other property interests. The property interest acquired may be any less-than-fee-simple interest, including an easement, life estate, covenant, or other contractual right. Acquisition may be accomplished by purchase, gift, grant, bequest, devise, covenant, or contract but only at a price that is equal to or less than the appraised value as provided in this section. The Commonwealth shall purchase these property interests only upon voluntary application of the landowner.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    If the landowner so elects, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay the purchase price in a lump-sum single payment at the time of closing, to enter into contracts for pay outs over a term of years against the purchase price, or to enter into installment purchase agreements. When pay outs over time are made, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay interest consistent with prevailing market conditions at the time of the execution of the contract.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    The interest which the Commonwealth owns in property other than eligible lands may be exchanged for property interests in eligible lands on an equivalent appraised value basis. If the property exchanged is not exactly equal in appraised value, cash payments may be made to provide net equivalent value in the exchange.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    After the Commonwealth acquires an agricultural conservation easement or some property interest less than full ownership in any eligible land, the Commonwealth may purchase the remaining agricultural rights or other property interest in the land when the acquisition is necessary to maintain the agricultural uses of the property.

    A grantor may terminate an easement, in whole or in part, only by filing an action in the Franklin Circuit Court, and demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that conditions on or surrounding the land subject to an agricultural conservation easement have changed so much that agriculture is no longer viable and it has become impossible to fulfill any of the easement’s conservation purposes.
