     Legislative intent.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    The General Assembly hereby recognizes that certain streams of Kentucky possess outstanding and unique scenic, recreational, geological, fish and wildlife, botanical, historical, archaeological and other scientific, aesthetic, and cultural values. It is the policy of the General Assembly to complement dam construction and development projects on Kentucky watercourses with other equally important and beneficial uses of our water resources. Therefore, it is hereby declared that in order to afford the citizens of the Commonwealth an opportunity to enjoy natural streams, to attract out-of-state visitors, to assure the well-being of our tourist industry, to preserve for future generations the beauty of certain areas untrammeled by man, it is in the interest of the Commonwealth to preserve some streams or portions thereof in their free-flowing condition because their natural, scenic, scientific, and aesthetic values outweigh their value for water development and control purposes now and in the future. For aesthetic, as well as ecological reasons, the foremost priority shall be to preserve the unique primitive character of those streams in Kentucky which still retain a large portion of their natural and scenic beauty, and to prevent future infringement on that beauty by impoundments or other man-made works. Since the stream areas are to be maintained in a natural state, they will also serve as areas for the perpetuation of Kentucky’s wild fauna and flora. Few such streams remain in the Eastern portion of the United States, and the General Assembly feels a strong obligation to the people of Kentucky to preserve these remnants of their proud heritage. It is the purpose of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to establish a Wild Rivers System by designating certain streams for immediate inclusion in the system and by prescribing the procedures and criteria for protecting and administering the system. It is not the intent of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to require or to authorize acquisition of all lands or interests in lands within the boundaries of the stream areas but to assure preservation of the scenic, ecological and other values and to provide proper management of the recreational, wildlife, water and other resources. It is the intent of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to impose reasonable regulations as to the use of private and public land within the authorized boundaries of wild rivers for the general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, and where necessary, to enable the department to acquire easements or lesser interests in or fee title to lands within the authorized boundaries of the wild rivers, so that the public trust in these unique natural rivers might be kept.

     Criteria for streams in Wild Rivers System.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    Streams which substantially meet the following criteria are eligible for inclusion in the Wild Rivers System: Streams or sections of streams that are essentially free-flowing, with shorelines and scenic vistas essentially primitive and unchanged, free from evidence of the works of man, and pleasing to the eye. The waters shall not be polluted beyond feasible correction and shall be kept unpolluted once corrected according to standards established by the Energy and Environment Cabinet through the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves. The area may provide a high quality fish and wildlife habitat, containing one or more unique or rare species for sport or observation. It may provide opportunities for scientific study or appreciation of essentially undisturbed ecological, geologic, or archaeologic conditions. It shall provide wilderness type recreation such as canoeing and hiking, or specialized uses without disturbing the primitive character of the area.

    Within the boundaries of a designated stream area, as established and authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly, the office shall be authorized and empowered to acquire by purchase, exercise of the rights of eminent domain, grant, gift, devise, or otherwise, the fee simple title, an easement, or any acceptable lesser interest in any lands, and by lease or conveyance, contract for the right to use and occupy any lands. Where property within such boundaries is owned by the federal government, the office can enter into agreements with the landowning agency concerning use of the property consistent with the objectives of KRS 146.200 to 146.360. Nothing in KRS 146.200 to 146.360 shall be construed to deprive a landowner of the fee simple title to or lesser interest in his property without just compensation.

    New roads, structures or buildings may be constructed only where necessary to effect a use permitted under the other provisions of KRS 146.200 to 146.360. Utility lines or pipelines may be constructed as approved by the office in writing and under provision that the affected land be restored as nearly as possible to its former state. This provision, however, shall in no way affect the rights between a landowner and a utility company or pipeline company. There shall be no strip mining as defined in KRS 350.010, and select cutting of timber or other resource removal and agricultural use, may be allowed pursuant to regulations promulgated by the secretary upon the granting of a permit under the other provisions of KRS 146.200 to 146.360. All instream disturbances such as dredging, shall be prohibited. Except for the management agency and any existing uses which do not conform to the purposes and intent of KRS 146.200 to 146.360, travel upon a wild river or any public lands within the designated boundaries thereof, shall be by foot, horseback, canoe, boat or other nonmechanical modes of transportation. If there are existing agricultural areas within the boundaries of the area, such areas may continue to be used for agricultural purposes.

    Any landowner within the boundaries of the area may apply to the office for a change of use to permit the select cutting of timber, a resource removal or an agricultural use upon his property located within the area. The office shall provide public notice within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the permit application, and the landowner or any interested person may, within thirty (30) days of the public notice, request a public hearing and provide any evidence or information as to whether the proposed use by the applying landowner is in accordance with the management plan developed pursuant to KRS 146.270, the purpose and intent of the Wild Rivers Act as expressed in KRS 146.220, and other applicable law.

    On or before thirty (30) days from the date of the office’s determination, the landowner may file with the office a written objection to the determination. If, within the next sixty (60) days the landowner and the secretary are unable to reach an agreement with respect to a modification of the determination, the office must either permit the use applied for, condemn the property, or petition the Franklin Circuit Court for an order restraining the proposed use. The order shall be entered immediately upon the filing of the petition and the execution of a bond without surety by the Commonwealth in an amount satisfactory to the court to indemnify the landowner against loss of profits from any wrongful restraint of the use of his property during the period from the filing of the petition until such time as the matter is concluded by the courts. The court shall review the decision as to both law and fact; but no factual finding shall be reversed unless clearly erroneous or else arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

    All areas within the borders of the Commonwealth, except those which are expressly dedicated by law for preservation and protection in their natural condition, are subject to alteration by human activity. As part of the continuing growth of the population and the economic development of the Commonwealth, it is necessary and desirable that the overall impact on the natural ecology be considered when major alterations are proposed affecting same, and that certain areas of unusual natural significance be set aside and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations. Such unique areas are valuable as laboratories for scientific research, as reservoirs of natural materials not all of the uses of which are now known, as habitats for plant and animal species and biotic communities, as living museums of the native landscape where people may observe nature’s web of life and our natural heritage, as places of historic and natural interest and scenic beauty, and as reminders of the vital human dependence upon fresh air, clean water, and unspoiled natural areas.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    It is therefore the public policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to secure for the people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of natural areas by establishing a system of nature preserves, protecting these areas and gathering and disseminating information regarding them, establishing and maintaining a registry of natural areas, and otherwise encouraging and assisting in the preservation of natural areas and features.

    An estate, interest or right in a natural area may be dedicated by any agency of the Commonwealth having jurisdiction thereof, by any other unit of government within the state having jurisdiction thereof, and by private owners thereof in the same manner as the ordinary conveyance of land. A dedication shall be deemed effective, and a natural area shall become a nature preserve only upon the acceptance of the articles of dedication by the office. Articles of dedication shall be placed on public record in the proper place for recording deeds in the county or counties in which the area is located, and with the office at its Frankfort office.

    Articles of dedication may contain restrictions relating to management, use, development, transfer, and public access, as well as such other provisions as may be necessary to further the purposes of KRS 146.410 to 146.530. Specifically, the donor, devisor or grantor of the preserve may prescribe the places where, and the means by which, the public may secure access to the preserve so as to protect the preserve from overuse and maintain the unencumbered private use of undedicated lands adjoining the preserve. The articles may likewise provide penalties and procedures to be applied in case of violation of their provisions. The articles may recognize and create reversionary rights, transfers upon conditions, and gifts. The articles may vary in provisions from one nature preserve to another in accordance with differences in the characteristics and conditions of the areas involved, or for other reasons found necessary by the office and the landowner.

   <p class="p7">
    Proposed regulations of the Commission were invalid to the extent that they purported to confer upon the Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission the power to designate certain species of flora or fauna as “endangered,” “threatened” or of “special concern” as such designation exceeded the authority conferred upon the Commission. OAG 84-233.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The maintaining of an inventory of natural flora and fauna is incidental to the primary function of the Commission of establishing and monitoring a system of nature preserves; in making such an inventory the Commission would list the types and quantity of various species but it could not make determinations as to whether the species was in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered. The Legislature has granted the authority to make such designation concerning fauna or wildlife to the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources but has apparently not delegated the authority to make such designation concerning flora or plant life to any government agency.

When a sufficient number of municipalities and counties have executed said agreement, copies shall be filed in the office of the clerk of each of the counties affected. Thereupon an area planning commission is established.

The office shall also send a copy of the notice to each soil and water conservation district through which the abandonment passes. If time is of the essence and it appears that the corridor is a suitable candidate for conversion to a railtrail and that no other railtrail interested entity will be participating in the federal proceeding, the office shall take those steps necessary to cause a railbanking or public use condition to be imposed in the federal proceeding;

    Pursuant to KRS 12.025 (repealed), a Governor’s executive order may supersede state law in matters relating to reorganization of agencies, departments, administrative bodies, etc., where such reorganization is necessary to promote greater economy, efficiency, and improved administration in establishing more effective organizational patterns. OAG 80-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Pursuant to the executive order of June, 1980 the Kentucky State Horse Park Board, now the State Horse Park Advisory Board, has no authority or control over the state department of parks personnel employed at the Kentucky State Horse Park since all authority over park employees has been transferred to the horse park management board. OAG 80-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Pursuant to the reorganization accomplished by executive order of June 30, 1980 the managerial and administrative functions of the Kentucky State Horse Park Board (KSHPB) have been transferred to the Kentucky Horse Park Management Board and control of the Kentucky State Horse Park has been transferred to the management board as a function of the transfer of all statutory management authority originally placed with the KSHPB pursuant to KRS Chapter 148 by the executive order; accordingly, once the management board members have been appointed and that board is in functioning order, control of the park is to be transferred to that board. OAG 80-399.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Governor has the power to abolish the Kentucky State Horse Park Board as such so long as the statutory functions vested in that body are retained and transferred to another body by way of a reorganization to promote greater efficiency, economy and improved administration pursuant to KRS 12.025 (repealed).

    Where a reorganization has transferred the functions of the Kentucky State Horse Park Board so that the board as such has no further functions, termination of the board members would be “for cause” if the Governor bears the burden of proving the reorganization which results in the board member’s termination is valid and necessary.

    For state scenic trails, the department shall select a route. The selected route shall be compatible with the preservation and enhancement of the environment it traverses. Reasonable effort shall be made to minimize any adverse effects upon adjacent landowners and users. Notice of the selected route shall be published by the department in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the trail is located, together with appropriate maps and descriptions.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    For state recreation trails and for connecting or side trails, the department shall select the route; provided, however, that when a route shall traverse land within the jurisdiction of a governmental unit or political subdivision, the department shall consult with such unit or such subdivision prior to its final determination for the location of the route.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    In selecting routes and implementing KRS 148.610 to 148.780, the department is encouraged to confer with the recognized and established organizations primarily interested in trail development, conservation, and outdoor recreation. Furthermore, the General Assembly encourages citizen participation in trail acquisition, construction, development, and maintenance where such activities will not conflict with the purpose of KRS 148.610 to 148.780.

    In the selection of the route for any trail, when the trail reaches an area of crop or fenced pasture land, the trail shall be so located as not to interfere in the growing of crops, or with the livestock, or pasture land, and such trail may then follow existing farm roads. The owner of such farm lands may enter a written agreement with the department to grant permission for the crossing of such crop or pasture land.

    The department shall review all formal declarations of railroad right-of-way abandonments by the Surface Transportation Board or other agency with jurisdiction and may review former railroad corridors for possible inclusion in the state trails system. The commissioner shall, within three (3) years after the route of a trail or trail segment included in the system has been located, determine the boundaries of the right-of-way to be associated with that trail. Such boundaries shall be established in such a manner that they protect the scenic value of the trail.

    The commissioner is authorized to develop effective procedures to assure that, wherever practicable, utility rights-of-way, abandoned railroad corridors, or similar properties having value for trail purposes may be made available for such use; however, the commissioner shall take into consideration the rights of adjacent property owners in the development of any such procedures. Other departments of state government having jurisdiction, control over, or information concerning the use, abandonment, or disposition of rights-of-way, railroad corridors, and similar properties that may be suitable for trail purposes shall cooperate with the commissioner in the transfer of these rights for trail use. These procedures shall include, at a minimum, that, for every railroad corridor that is the subject of a request for federal authority to discontinue service or for federal regulatory abandonment, the commissioner shall evaluate the potential of converting that corridor into a railtrail. The commissioner shall cause a preliminary review to be completed within thirty (30) days of the publication of the request for federal authority in the Federal Register. The commissioner shall cause a final review to be completed ninety (90) days after the publication of the request for federal authority in the Federal Register. The commissioner shall timely transmit copies of these reviews to the Legislative Research Commission and to the Commonwealth’s Railtrail Development Office in the Department for Local Government as they are completed. If either review indicates the possibility of converting the corridor into a railtrail, the commissioner may participate in the federal proceeding to request that the corridor be railbanked in accordance with federal law or to request the imposition of a public use condition.

    The General Assembly recognizes that the ridge top of Pine Mountain is a unique area desirable for the creation of a trail. Therefore, it is hereby declared that in order to afford the citizens of the Commonwealth an opportunity to enjoy this natural area, to attract out-of-state visitors, to ensure the well-being of our tourism industry, to preserve for future generations the beauty of certain areas untrammeled by man, to provide for the ever-increasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding population, and to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the outdoor areas and historic resources of the Commonwealth, there is hereby established a certain defined area in the southeastern part of the Commonwealth for ultimate designation as the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail, with land in the defined area owned or leased by the Commonwealth or on which the Commonwealth has obtained an easement comprising the initial state park.

    It is the intent of KRS 148.870 to 148.892 to assure preservation of the scenic, ecological, and other values within the boundaries of the trail and to provide proper management of the recreational, wildlife, water, and other resources within those boundaries. It is further the intent of KRS 148.870 to 148.892 to impose reasonable policies governing the use of land within the authorized boundaries of the trail, except for the restrictions set forth in KRS 148.870 to 148.892, for the general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth and, where necessary, to enable the Commonwealth or any of its agencies to acquire fee title or lesser interests in land within the boundaries of the trail, in order to maintain the public trust in this unique area.

    There is hereby designated a linear state park, the boundaries of which shall be determined by the department in accordance with this section known as the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail, a trail of approximately one hundred twenty (120) miles in length, located exclusively within the boundaries of Kentucky beginning along the border of Kentucky and Virginia at or near Breaks Interstate Park, and extending generally south-southwest along the crest of Pine Mountain to the vicinity of Pine Mountain State Resort Park and continuing south to the Cumberland Gap National Park on the vicinity thereof. Insofar as practicable, the boundaries of the trail from the Breaks Interstate Park to Bad Branch State Nature Preserve shall be a one thousand (1,000) foot corridor, the center of which shall be the crest of Pine Mountain, to the extent that the corridor does not encroach upon the territory of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Insofar as practicable, the boundaries of the trail from the Bad Branch State Nature Preserve to the Pine Mountain State Resort Park shall be a corridor one hundred (100) to two hundred fifty (250) feet along the level top of Pine Mountain. The route of the trail from Pine Mountain State Resort Park to Cumberland Gap National Park shall be a corridor no wider than two hundred fifty (250) feet to be determined by the department. Notwithstanding these boundary limitations, the department may through negotiations with the land owner acquire additional land outside the boundary limitations. The trail shall be depicted on the “Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail Map,” which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the commissioner of the department. The trail map shall delineate those portions of the trail that are owned or leased by the Commonwealth or on which the Commonwealth has obtained an easement and shall be updated periodically solely for the purpose of reflecting additions to those specific areas.

    A forest warden may arrest without warrant any person whom he observes committing in his presence a violation of any law enacted for the protection of forests of this state. OAG 63-323.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Within the state forests a forest warden is authorized to exercise powers of a peace officer so far as concerns any violation of laws enacted for the protection of the forests. OAG 63-323.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    This section states in effect that forest wardens and their assistants are not trespassers when they are carrying out their statutory duties but the immunity granted does not extend to the negligent conduct of such persons while performing their duty which causes damage to the personal and real property of another. OAG 68-570.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A forest warden may act as a peace officer for the protection of the forests of the state by enforcing KRS 433.753 and 433.757, but he may not act as a peace officer in enforcing these laws if the littering is not directly related to the protection of the forests of the state. OAG 70-550.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A forest warden’s power of arrest includes only arrests for violations which can reasonably be expected to injure the forests. OAG 70-550.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a forest warden is authorized by statute to exercise the powers of a peace officer and since KRS 61.300(1) provides that no one shall serve as a non-elective peace officer unless he is 21 years of age or over, the minimum age requirement for a state forest warden is 21 years of age.

    While a division of forestry had a ministerial duty to fight a forest fire under KRS 149.360, the methods used to fight that fire, including determinations that the fire had been contained and it was appropriate to leave the area, were discretionary; therefore, the division was not liable for negligence for a burned garage. Under KRS 44.073(2), the Kentucky Board of Claims had jurisdiction over claims involving the negligent performance of ministerial acts. Energy & Env't Cabinet v. Robinson, 363 S.W.3d 24, 2012 Ky.

    Intention of enacting provision requiring device to prevent sparks of fire from escaping was to protect adjoining property from large cinders escaping from smokestacks and not to protect persons from injuries caused by cinders small enough to enter an eye.

    If railroad permitted combustible material to accumulate on its right-of-way and an otherwise harmless spark from one of its engines ignited the material, railroad was liable for damage to adjoining property even though it was using best type of spark arrester and operating trains prudently.

    Once the assessment date for ad valorem property taxes had passed, the Marshall County Fiscal Court had no authority to order the assessment of timberland in the county for that year for the tax permitted by this section. OAG 62-569.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When state forest fire protection has been afforded, the contribution by the county to the Division of Forestry (now Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet) is mandatory and must be paid by the county whether or not it levies the tax against the timberland owners. OAG 70-403.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Legislature obviously anticipated the potential for collection shortfalls due to various causes by allowing counties to levy timberland assessments of up to three cents (3¢) per acre, when the maximum amount due to the cabinet could only be two cents (2¢) per acre and no other purpose can be assumed for this assessment authority, since under KRS 149.590 assessments collected can only be used for making payments to the department pursuant to this section. OAG 79-38.

   <p class="p7">
    The sheriff collects timberland assessments on behalf of the county, and if, for whatever reason, the assessments collected from timberland owners and deposited in the county forest fire protection fund are insufficient to cover the amount due to the cabinet from the county, the county is obligated to make up the difference from general funds of the county.

    A motel guest is not a “tenant” as the term is defined in subsection (30) (now subsection (38)) of this section and consequently is not within the exception of KRS 150.170(3) (now 150.170(4)) and must have a state fishing license in order to fish in a small lake on motel property which has been stocked by the motel owner at his own expense. OAG 62-568.

    Hunting includes the pursuit of game as well as the killing or capturing of game so that a license is required to chase red fox with dogs at night for the sport of the chase with no intent to kill or capture the fox. OAG 62-1053.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    A resident hunting license could be issued to a person who was temporarily residing in another state if he has a permanent home in Kentucky to which he plans to return and if he can prove that he resided in Kentucky for the six months just prior to the application. OAG 68-440.

   <p class="p7">
    The thirty-day residency requirement for voters is completely unrelated to the six-month residency requirement for a license under this section. OAG 72-450.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The residency provisions of subsections (15) and (22) (now subsections (20) and (30)) of this section do not render the section unconstitutional in the absence of a showing by any challenger that the differential treatment of $5.00 for a resident license and $10.00 for a nonresident license is arbitrary or in the absence of a showing that the statute’s discrimination is so potently without reason that no conceivable situation of fact can be found to justify it.

    Subject to license and regulations, dogs alone may be used to hunt, wound, and kill opossum and raccoon. Opossum and raccoon fighting against the dogs “may reasonably be expected to accomplish these acts.” So, participation in shakeout seasons as it is regulated by the department at 301 KAR 2:110, is statutorily authorized by this chapter.

    Lectures presented by conservation officers to students on the subject of conservation of fish and game resources are consistent with the intent of the statute and such practice is not violative of the limitation placed on the expenditure of the game and fish fund. OAG 63-37.

    The state has not delegated any of its authority in the area of conservation of fish and wildlife resources to local governments; the state, pursuant to this chapter, has established a statutory scheme of control and regulation relative to fish and wildlife resources and, if the statutes are inadequate or incomplete, the General Assembly will have to enact corrective legislation or the department will have to adopt regulations, where permissible.

    There being no legislative waiver of the Commonwealth’s immunity from suit for damage by wild deer, and there being no legal duty of the Commonwealth to prevent wild deer from damaging persons or property such as would give rise to a Board of Claims action sounding in negligence, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, incurs no legal liability as a result of wild deer injuring persons or damaging property.

    The Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources has authority to promulgate a regulation setting a size limit on largemouth bass in a particular lake provided there is some reasonable basis for differentiating between this body of water and others throughout the state and making the regulation apply only to the taking of fish in this lake.

    The Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources has the authority to adopt regulations governing the use of shooting ranges at all wildlife areas in the Commonwealth and has the authority to enforce these regulations; however, these regulations must be uniform in that they apply to every wildlife area in the state where shooting takes place and unless a certain wildlife area is in a class by itself, no regulations may be adopted specifically for that area.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    The Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources cannot require a person to be a member of a nonprofit corporation as a prerequisite to using the shooting ranges at a certain wildlife area for such requirement would be an unlawful endorsement of this nonprofit corporation to the exclusion of other private corporations, commercial or nonprofit, and would be illegal and in violation of the Constitution; moreover, since there is no basis for such a classification, such requirement would be unconstitutional as a violation of §§ 59 and 60 of the Kentucky Constitution.

    Since under this section a portion of the fine for violations of the fish and game laws contained in this chapter is paid to the fish and game fund in the State Treasury, the tax imposed by KRS 142.030 (now repealed) is applicable and should be made part of the costs assessed against the convicted defendant.

    Pursuant to this section, the 40 percent fee of the county attorney for prosecutions of fish and game violations is paid directly and only the remaining 60 percent is sent to the commissioner of fish and wildlife resources. OAG 67-14. (Decision prior to 1967 amendment.)

    If a judge of the juvenile court unlawfully imposed a fine or jail sentence on a juvenile for a violation of the fish and game laws, any legal action against him personally probably would be subject to the defense of judicial immunity and any action for the recovery of a fine probably would be complicated by the provisions of KRS 150.140 and this section.

    There is a distinction between a hunting license and a permit, as the license authorizes the hunter to take or pursue all permissible wild animals, while in order to hunt deer, the hunter must also have a permit, and OAGs 71-142 and 72-774, insofar as they have become inconsistent with subsequent statutory amendment regarding exemptions for hunters, are hereby withdrawn.

    Because a state court had held KRS 150.740 to be unconstitutionally vague, and no state appellate court had reviewed the issue, it was uncertain whether the statute would be enforced by personnel of Kentucky’s Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources if any member of plaintiff deer farmers’
    association transported cervids along Kentucky’s roadways; thus, there was no concrete factual context for addressing KRS 150.740 on an as-applied basis, a facial challenge to the statute was premature, and the association’s complaint for declaratory relief was dismissed as unripe. N. Am. Deer Farmers Ass'n v. Gassett, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66946 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 2, 2008).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 150.740 is unconstitutional as being void for vagueness; it was reasonable to believe that defendant drove through Kentucky in good faith with no notice that merely driving through Kentucky with deer and elk was a felony; the statute does not define the word “importation” or provide any limitation on the common meaning of importation, there was no administrative regulation construing the statute, and it would be reasonable for a defendant to believe that as long as he does not unload cervids in Kentucky, he will not be importing them.

    (7/15/2010). 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 158, sec. 11, amended this section and added the phrase “the knowing violating of” in subsection 16(d). From an examination of the bill and of KRS 501.020, “Definition of mental states,” it is apparent that the phrase used should have been “knowingly violating.” This change has been made by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136.

    Kentucky is a common-law state and in states where the common law as to crime is in force, if a statute fixing a penalty for an offense does not expressly or by implication cut off the common-law offense, the statute must be taken to intend only a cumulative remedy and the common-law remedy still remains so an indictment under the common law for the public offense of maintaining a nuisance by polluting streams and killing the fish therein is valid even though KRS 150.460 covers the same offense.

    The conservation, development, and proper use of the water resources of the Commonwealth of Kentucky have become of vital importance as a result of population expansion and concentration, industrial growth, technological advances, and an ever increasing demand for water for varied domestic, agricultural, industrial, municipal, and recreational uses. It is recognized by the General Assembly that excessive rainfall during certain seasons of the year causes damage from overflowing streams. However, prolonged droughts at other seasons curtail industrial, municipal, agricultural, and recreational uses of water and seriously threaten the continued growth and economic well-being of the Commonwealth. The advancement of the safety, happiness, and welfare of the people and the protection of property require that the power inherent in the people be utilized to promote and to regulate the conservation, development, and most beneficial use of the water resources. It is hereby declared that the general welfare requires that the water resources of the Commonwealth be put to the beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, that the waste or nonbeneficial use of water be prevented, and that the conservation and beneficial use of water be exercised in the interest of the people. Therefore, it is declared the policy of the Commonwealth to actively encourage and to provide financial, technical, or other support for projects that will control and store our water resources in order that the continued growth and development of the Commonwealth might be assured. To that end, it is declared to be the purpose of KRS Chapters 146, 149, 151, 224, 262, and KRS 350.029 and 433.750 to 433.757 for the Commonwealth to permit, regulate, and participate in the construction or financing of facilities to store surplus surface water for future use; to conserve and develop the ground water resources of the Commonwealth; to require local communities to develop long range water supply plans; to protect the rights of all persons equitably and reasonably interested in the use and availability of water; to prohibit the pollution of water resources and to maintain the normal flow of all streams so that the proper quantity and quality of water will be available at all times to the people of the Commonwealth; to provide for the adequate disposition of water among the people of the Commonwealth entitled to its use during severe droughts or times of emergency; to prevent harmful overflows and flooding; to regulate the construction, maintenance, and operation of all dams and other barriers of streams; to prevent the obstruction of streams and floodways by the dumping of substances therein; to keep accurate records on the amount of water withdrawal from streams and watercourses and reasonably regulate the amount of withdrawal of public water; and to engage in other activities as may be necessary to conserve and develop the water resources of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and to ensure adequate supply of water for domestic, agricultural, recreational, and economic development uses.

    It is a finding of the General Assembly that groundwater is an important but vulnerable natural resource of this state, that the majority of rural Kentuckians rely exclusively on groundwater for drinking, and that groundwater is inextricably linked to surface waters which may also serve as a drinking water resource. It is also a finding that groundwater is a resource equally vital for agricultural, commercial, and industrial purposes and that useable groundwater is critical to the future development of these industries. Therefore, it shall be the policy of this state to manage groundwater for the health, welfare, and economic prosperity of all citizens.

An order or final determination includes, but is not limited to, the issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a permit, but does not include the issuance of a notice of violation, the issuance of a letter identifying deficiencies in an application for a permit, a registration or a certification, or other nonfinal determinations. Unless the cabinet considers that the petition is frivolous, it shall serve written notice of the petition on each person named therein and shall schedule a hearing before the cabinet not less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, or unless the person complained against waives in writing the thirty (30) day period. The right to demand a hearing pursuant to this section shall be limited to a period of thirty (30) days after the petitioner has had actual notice of the order or final determination complained of, or could reasonably have had such notice.

    It is the preference of the General Assembly that funds contributed by a permittee under a Section 404 Permit into an in-lieu fund for a project designed for stream restoration and mitigation be utilized within the watershed where the adverse effects occur. The General Assembly recognizes that conservation and protection of the water resources of the Commonwealth, including streams, rivers, wetlands, and riparian habitats, may involve, in addition to restoration and enhancement of aquatic and riparian habitat, proper management of wastewater and stormwater, and abatement of pre-existing sources of pollution. Where an authority has been qualified by the USACE to manage an in-lieu fee or other compensatory mitigation arrangement that is approved after July 15, 2008, under Section 404, and to the extent that the USACE and the Mitigation Review Team has approved the use of such funds for elimination of pre-existing sources of pollution, the authority may expend a portion of the funds for those purposes, provided that the:

    The General Assembly finds that groundwater makes up over ninety-five percent (95%) of the water resources in Kentucky. Groundwater accounts for over thirty percent (30%) of the public and domestic water supplies in the Commonwealth, and up to ninety percent (90%) of all rural domestic supplies, and is the major source of water to streams. It is imperative that a system for characterizing and monitoring groundwater be developed so that information acquired through various monitoring programs will allow Kentucky to identify and characterize the groundwater resource. The information from the monitoring network can be used to enhance the Kentucky Groundwater Data Repository; identify, characterize, and model groundwater systems; develop community and private water supplies; address resource allocation concerns; set boundaries on wellhead protection areas; recognize groundwater degradation if it occurs; and evaluate and improve the quality and quantity of data collected through all programs.

Notes issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds may be retired out of the proceeds of the bonds. The bonds may be executed and delivered by the authority at any time and from time to time, may be in the form and denominations and of the terms and maturities, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in the installments and at the time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at the place or places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at the rate or rates payable at the time or times and at the place or places and evidenced in the manner, may be executed by the officers of the authority, and may contain the provisions not inconsistent herewith, as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board under which the bonds are authorized to be issued.

Issuance by the board of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Proceeds of bonds issued by the authority may be used for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, reconstructing, improving, equipping, furnishing, bettering, or extending any project or projects as authorized by KRS 151.650 to 151.664, including the payment of interest on the bonds during construction of any project and for two (2) years after the estimated date of completion, and payment of engineering, fiscal, architectural, and legal expenses incurred in connection with the project and the issuance of the bonds and the establishment of a reasonable reserve fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds in the event of a deficiency in the revenues and receipts available for the payment.

    The General Assembly declares that based upon an implied contract between the Commonwealth and the United States government through the Secretary of the United States Army and his predecessors, the validity of which is evidenced by over one hundred (100) years of performance by the federal government, it is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Congress to operate and maintain the locks and dams on the Kentucky River and therefore urges the Congress and the corps to provide the funds necessary to properly maintain the locks and dams, the condition of which the General Assembly finds is deteriorating.

    The General Assembly recognizes the historic importance of the Kentucky River locks and dams in providing a source of clean water supply for several hundred thousand citizens of the Commonwealth. Therefore, if the Congress and the corps fail to fulfill their responsibility for the Kentucky River locks and dams as stated in subsection (1) of this section and the Commonwealth thereby must assume ownership of the locks and dams, it shall be the public policy of the Commonwealth to protect the health and welfare of the citizens dependent upon this system of locks and dams for their source of clean water, and to that end, the Commonwealth shall provide for the proper maintenance of the Kentucky River locks and dams through the Kentucky River Authority. It shall be the public policy of the Commonwealth that should the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Congress fail to fulfill their responsibility to maintain and operate the Kentucky River locks and dams, and should all efforts on the part of the Commonwealth fail to force the corps and Congress to fulfill their responsibility, then the Commonwealth shall assume ownership of all United States Army Corps of Engineers property, both real and personal, on or adjacent to the Kentucky River after ninety (90) days from the date on which the corps obtains final authority to dispose of such property. During that ninety (90) day period, the Commonwealth shall publish legal notice of its intention to assume ownership of the property.

    The authority is hereby authorized to provide, at one (1) time or from time to time, for the issuance of its revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one (1) or more projects undertaken pursuant to KRS 151.720. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall in each instance be payable solely from a special fund provided for the payment, with revenues derived from water use fees collected from all facilities using water from the Kentucky River basin, except those facilities using water primarily for agricultural purposes, pledged to be set aside and deposited in such special fund. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more such series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding the thirtieth anniversary of their respective dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of bonds including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be affixed thereto and attested by the manual signature of the treasurer of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall have and are hereby declared to have all qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for such bonds or any account or accounts therein as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing such bonds.

    The party states recognize that the proper employment of nuclear energy, facilities, materials, and products can assist substantially in the industrialization of the south and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from the acquisition of nuclear resources and facilities requires systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the south and contribute to the individual and community well being of the region’s people.

    Experts project that world oil prices will remain very high because production is at or near its peak while world demand for oil is increasing rapidly. This increase in demand is due largely to economic growth in developing nations, especially China, where oil demand grew by twenty percent (20%) in 2004 and is expected to grow by a similar amount in 2005;

    The price of crude oil is the major factor driving up prices for gasoline, as well as for oil used for home heating in addition to commercial and industrial purposes. Natural gas for home heating and other purposes has been driven to record-high prices as a result of supply constriction and increased demand from the industrial sector;

    Technologies have long existed for producing transportation fuels from indigenous fossil and biomass energy resources in the United States, and research has demonstrated that coal-based alternate fuel technologies are cost-effective when the world price of petroleum exceeds thirty-five dollars ($35) per barrel;

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)

    The United States has trillions of tons of indigenous fossil energy resources and agricultural capacity that rival total worldwide conventional oil reserves. These domestic resources are capable of producing alternate transportation fuels sufficient to make the United States independent of foreign petroleum imports. Kentucky has hundreds of years of fossil energy resources, and the Commonwealth’s agriculture produces substantial biomass materials for production of premium-quality liquid transportation fuels;

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    The development of an alternate transportation fuels industry in the United States will create long-term reliable demand for Kentucky’s energy and agricultural resources, stabilizing both the energy industries and the agriculture community;

    Coal-based alternate transportation fuel technologies are capable of producing environmentally superior transportation fuels from near-zero-emission plants with removal or capture of virtually all pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide, and from biomass-based technologies that are very environmentally positive. The United States can set an example for the world by implementing these technologies, and Kentucky is poised to lead the way;

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    Coal-based technologies in the United States are capable of producing pipeline-quality natural gas and industrial-quality natural gas at prices which are below current annual market prices for natural gas;

    <span class="boldspan">

    Kentucky’s universities have for several decades been among the leading entities in the United States doing research on transportation fuels from coal and oil shale. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture has provided support relating to development of transportation fuels from Kentucky agricultural materials;

    Although developing an alternate fuels industry capable of reducing America’s dependence on foreign sources of petroleum requires the large-scale financial and technical resources of the federal government and private industry, only government and industry in the states can ensure the most efficient and productive on-site joining of technologies, energy resources, and industrial and transportation infrastructure;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (13)
    </span>
    The economic, national security, and environmental advantages of establishing thriving domestic alternative liquid fuels and synthetic natural gas industries vastly outweigh the development costs. In contrast, doing little or nothing subjects America to continued and repeated energy supply disruptions and to potentially severe economic consequences;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (14)
    </span>
    Embarking on a national mission to achieve energy security and move toward liquid and synthetic fuels independence will not only reduce risk and lower oil prices, natural gas prices, and oil price volatility, it will also facilitate an industrial rebirth, create jobs, foster new technology, and enhance economic growth; and
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    Kentucky, through its universities, has done the research and testing of these environmentally responsible alternative liquid fuel technologies. Kentucky has the natural resources to be the leader in achieving energy security and independence for the United States.

    To ensure that Kentucky will lead the states in securing the energy independence of the United States and will consequently benefit from economic growth and stabilization of the Commonwealth’s coal industry and agriculture, the Office of Energy Policy shall develop and implement a strategy for production of alternative transportation fuels and synthetic natural gas from fossil energy resources and biomass resources. The strategy shall address:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    Technologies available or in use for producing alternative transportation fuels and synthetic natural gas from fossil energy resources and biomass resources and the relative advantages of these in terms of process efficiencies, environmental performance, and marketable products, including chemicals, industrial feedstocks, and electricity;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    Research, demonstration, and commercial-scale construction and operation of one (1) or more technologies, and follow-up expansion;

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    The essential nature of efficient cooperation, coordination, and synergy between the efforts of the Office of Energy Policy and those of Kentucky’s public and private colleges and universities in order to maximize Kentucky’s opportunities to access federal funds and to receive research grants and awards from federal and other sources to fund the development of clean coal technology, coal-to-liquid-fuel conversion, synthetic natural gas, alternative transportation fuels, and biomass resources;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    The identification of federal funds available for research, development, construction, and operation of alternative transportation fuels or synthetic natural gas plants at laboratory, demonstration, and commercial scale;
   </li>

    </span>
    Industry participation, both by single firms and by consortia, in research, development, construction, and operation of alternative transportation fuels or synthetic natural gas plants;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)
    </span>
    Establishment or expansion of Kentucky state government incentives for development, construction, or operation of alternative transportation fuels and synthetic natural gas production facilities, including but not limited to financial incentives, tax incentives, mandating or providing incentives for use of alternative transportation fuels and synthetic natural gas by state government, school districts, or utilities, authority to issue bonds, and acquisition and preliminary environmental assessment of industrial sites; and
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    It is the finding of the General Assembly that cultural opportunities and the arts have a direct and positive impact on the hotel industry through promotion of tourism and convention trade. The Kentucky Center for the Arts will serve as catalyst in the development of Louisville and Jefferson County as a major convention and entertainment center. The Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation will have as management priority the stimulation of the Jefferson County hotel industry and promotion of tourism through:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The presentation of Kentucky and Louisville-area and nationally and internationally prominent arts activities which will attract regional audiences;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    Regional and national promotion of events occurring within the Commonwealth, along with ancillary services and activities;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    The development, in conjunction with local hotels and the arts and entertainment industry, of tourist packages including performance and group plans;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    The active participation with local hotels and convention bureaus in attracting non-arts related conferences and conventions, with the center serving as an important amenity;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (f)
    </span>
    The development of a Kentucky folklore program which will attract participants and an audience from throughout the state;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (g)
    </span>
    The contribution to cultural diversity and the attractiveness of Louisville and Jefferson County as a year-round tourist and entertainment attraction.

    For these reasons, the General Assembly concludes that the dedication of additional revenues from the increased transient room tax authorized in counties containing first class cities to the Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation will directly benefit the Jefferson County hotel industry, and that this dedication symbolizes the integral relationship between the Kentucky center and promotion of the Jefferson County hotel industry, created by KRS 153.400 to 153.460.

    The Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation is not under the “direction and control” of the central state government but of its directors who are appointed for four year terms and act autonomously and cannot be removed except for cause; given this, coupled with the fact that the purpose of the Arts Corporation is to provide entertainment, albeit in the name of promoting tourism, and thus the economic welfare of Louisville and Jefferson County, these facts compel the conclusion that the constitutional fathers would not view this activity as qualifying for sovereign immunity.

    The line between what is a state agency and what is a municipal corporation is not divided by whether the entity created by state statute is or is not a city, but whether, when viewed as a whole, the entity is carrying out a function integral to state government and the Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation does not qualify for sovereign immunity under this concept.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the board is authorized to exercise the following power:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The board may provide for the issuance of economic development revenue bonds by the cabinet, for the purpose of providing funds and moneys to enable the cabinet to exercise and fulfill the powers and authority set forth in KRS 154.10-030, to enter into agreements with governmental agencies and private companies, corporations, partnerships, and other such entities, acquire and lease projects to governmental agencies and private companies, corporations, cabinets, and other such entities, purchase obligations of governmental agencies issued for economic development projects, and make loans or grants for economic development projects, and to enable the cabinet generally to carry out and effectuate its proper purposes under this chapter. In anticipation of the issuance of the revenue bonds, the board may provide for the issuance at one (1) time, or from time to time, of revenue bond anticipation notes pursuant to the general laws of the state. The principal of and the interest on the revenue bonds or notes shall be payable solely from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes. Any such notes may be made payable from the proceeds of bonds or renewal notes, or in the event bond or renewal note proceeds are not available, or should the board deem it financially practicable to pay the notes directly from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, the notes may be paid from any revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes. Prior to the issuance of the bonds or notes, the cabinet shall submit any proposed issue to the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee for its review and determination in accordance with provisions of KRS 45.810.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)

    The revenue bonds or notes of the cabinet shall be dated and may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the board at prices and under terms and conditions determined by the board. Any bonds or notes shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall be payable annually or at shorter intervals, and may bear conversion privileges determined by the board. Notes shall mature at the time or times not exceeding five (5) years from their date or dates, and revenue bonds shall mature at the time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates as may be determined by the board. The board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds or notes, and shall fix the denomination or denominations and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer of the board whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any revenue bonds or notes shall cease to be such officer before the delivery thereof, the signature of the facsimile shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the officer had remained in office until the delivery. At the time of issuance of variable rate revenue bonds, the board may designate individuals or institutions which, in the sole judgment of the board, have financial market expertise to serve as agent for the board for establishing and changing from time to time, while the variable rate revenue bonds remain outstanding, the rate of interest to be borne by and the price to be paid for the revenue bonds. The rate-setting procedures and authority of each agent shall be set forth in writing, and may include a formula or an index or indices based upon market factors, and shall be established by the board at the time of issuance of the revenue bonds.

    In the discretion of the board, any revenue bonds or notes issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the cabinet and corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. A trust indenture, or the resolution of the board providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or notes, may pledge or assign for the security of the revenue bonds or notes, all or any part of the totality of revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes received and to be received. The trust indenture or resolution of the board may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders which may be reasonable and proper, and not in violation of law, including, but not limited to, covenants and provisions setting forth the duties of the cabinet in relation to the purposes to which revenue bonds and note proceeds may be applied; the disposition or pledging of assets and revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all such revenues. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of revenue bonds, notes, or revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, to furnish such indemnifying bonds, or to pledge such securities as may be required by a trust indenture or resolution of the board. Any trust indenture or board resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders, where a trust indenture has been entered into. In addition to the foregoing, any trust indenture or board resolution may contain other provisions which the board determines to be reasonable and proper for the further security of the holders of any revenue bonds or notes. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of a trust indenture or bond proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of operating the cabinet, and may be paid from revenues pledged or assigned to the payment of the principal of and the interest on revenue bonds or notes, or from any other funds properly available to the cabinet for bond purposes. However, the payment of operational costs from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes shall, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, be subordinate to the payment of principal of and interest on cabinet revenue bonds or notes from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, it being intended that these principal and interest requirements shall be secured by a prior and paramount lien on gross revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes.

    The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority is hereby authorized to develop and fund a small business loan program to assist new or existing small businesses operating in the Commonwealth. The authority may lend up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to any eligible small business for acquisition, construction, expansion, working capital, or any other business expense the authority deems reasonable to approve.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The authority shall determine the terms, conditions, and requirements for loans issued under this section, including collateral requirements when deemed reasonable and appropriate. Recognizing that small businesses, while essential for the economic vitality of the Commonwealth, may have difficulty obtaining conventional loans, the authority may provide terms that are more lenient, high-risk, less secure, or otherwise less stringent than industry standards.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    To be eligible for a loan under this section, a small business shall be engaged in manufacturing, agribusiness, or service or technology, shall not be engaged primarily in retail, and shall commit to creating and maintaining at least one (1) new full-time job above the number existing on the date of application.

    The purposes of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 are to encourage capital investment in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, to encourage the establishment or expansion of small businesses in Kentucky, to provide additional jobs, and to encourage the development of new products and technologies in the state through capital investments. It is the intent of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 to give investment preference to Kentucky small businesses showing a potential for rapid growth. Insofar as possible, any investment made in a Kentucky small business under the provisions of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 shall be used by that business to leverage additional capital investments from other sources.

The Reviser of Statutes has determined that making such a conforming change during the 2018 codification exceeds the permissible correction of manifest clerical or typographical errors under KRS 7.136(1)(h). Therefore, the reference to KRS 136.070 remains unchanged and would have to be changed pursuant to future legislative action.

However, in this section and in sec. 216 of the bill, KRS 154.22-010, this phrase was not changed or deleted. It appears that leaving this phrase in these two sections was an oversight.

   <p class="p7">
    (7/12/2006). A reference in subsection (3)(a) of this section has been corrected in codification to read “subsection (8)(b)4.” because the necessary adjustments to this internal reference were not made in either 2002 Ky. Acts ch. 338, sec. 25, or 2006 Ky. Acts ch. 149, sec. 217, each of which inserted a new subsection into this statute. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected these oversights under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h).

     (1)
    </span>
    If an eligible company operates an existing service and technology business in Kentucky, and wishes to expand that business within the Commonwealth, the eligible company may submit an application to the authority to become an approved company and eligible for the inducements offered in KRS 154.24-010 to 154.24-150.

    <span class="boldspan">

    If an existing business becomes an approved company, the authority shall determine a base level of employment, a base level of state income tax liability, a base level of limited liability entity tax liability, and a base level of services of the approved company for determining eligible credits in remaining years of the approved company’s project period. The base level shall be determined by taking into consideration any seasonal fluctuations or aberrations of employment levels over a preceding three (3) year period. Notwithstanding the determination of a base level of employment, no employee of the existing business who is an employee of such business prior to the date of the preliminary resolution of the authority as prescribed in KRS 154.24-100 shall be subject to assessment.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)

    The authority shall identify, by name, all of the existing employees engaged in the service and technology activity, and these employees shall be exempt from the assessment. If any of these employees cease working in the activity, another employee shall be added to the base level of employment, based on the earliest date of entry into the workforce, and he shall be exempt from the assessment. The authority may negotiate with the approved company a different method of determining the base level of employment which would yield a more equitable result for the approved company, the Commonwealth, local jurisdictions, and the employees.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)

    To become eligible for inducements, the approved company shall create and maintain above the base level of employment an increase at the site of the economic development project of at least fifteen (15) full-time employees who are residents of the Commonwealth, subject to the Kentucky income tax.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)

    The approved company shall continue to pay to the Commonwealth, on an annualized basis during the term of the agreement, the base level of income tax, and limited liability entity tax adjusted on an annual basis to reflect changes in the consumers price index. Any excess income tax or limited liability entity tax owed may be taken as a credit.

    (4/27/2018). KRS 136.0704 was repealed in 2018 Ky. Acts chs. 171 and 207, but a conforming amendment was not made to this statute to address the reference it contains to KRS 136.0704. The Reviser of Statutes has determined that making such a conforming change during the 2018 codification exceeds the permissible correction of manifest clerical or typographical errors under KRS 7.136(1)(h). Therefore, the reference to KRS 136.0704 remains unchanged and would have to be changed pursuant to future legislative action.

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    The purpose of this subchapter is to assist the Commonwealth in moving to the forefront of national efforts to achieve energy independence by reducing the Commonwealth’s reliance on imported energy resources. The provisions of this subchapter seek to accomplish this purpose by providing incentives for companies that, in a carbon capture ready manner, construct, retrofit, or upgrade facilities for the purpose of:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    2008 Ky. Acts ch. 178, sec. 14 established a new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 concerning tax increment financing projects and provided further that “KRS 65.7045 is repealed, reenacted, and amended as a new section thereof to read as follows.” Since
    KRS 65.7045 was also amended in sec. 2 of that Act, inquiry was made of the drafter as to the intent of sec. 14. The drafter explained that statutes dealing with both area development projects and tax increment financing projects were blended together in KRS Chapter 65 with no easy distinguishing elements, and the intent of creating Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 was to separate them appropriately. The intent of sec. 14 was to create a definitions section for the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154, using the text of
    KRS 65.7045 as a base starting point, removing definitions specific to KRS Chapter 65 area development projects, retaining definitions that were common to both area development projects and tax increment financing projects, and adding definitions specific to tax increment financing projects. As such, the Reviser of Statutes has treated sec. 14 in codification as creating a new section of Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 (this statute) to effectuate that intent.

    (7/15/2008). 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 178, sec. 14 established a new Subchapter 30 of Chapter 154 concerning tax increment financing projects and secs. 16 through 19 and 21 of that Act repealed, reenacted, and amended existing sections of KRS Chapter 65 as new sections of the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154. Inquiry was made of the drafter as to the intent of those actions. The drafter explained that statutes dealing with both area development projects and tax increment financing projects were blended together in KRS Chapter 65 with no easy distinguishing elements, and the intent of creating Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 was to separate them appropriately. Therefore, the intent of secs. 16 through 19 and 21 was to move those sections contained in KRS Chapter 65 that relate to only tax increment financing projects into the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154, with necessary conforming amendments to the language. The Reviser of Statutes inquired about the treatment of sec. 20 of that Act purporting to amend KRS 65.7079, which appeared to the Reviser to require the same treatment as other statutes in that range moved into new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 in secs. 16 through 19 and 21. The drafter confirmed that the intent was to treat that statute in the same manner as those statutes addressed in secs. 16 through 19 and 21. As such, the Reviser of Statutes has treated sec. 20 in codification as repealing and reenacting this statute as a new section of Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 to effectuate that intent.

    KRS 154.48-010 was repealed in
    2018 Ky. Acts chs. 171,

    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky finds that the forests of the Commonwealth provide abundant, renewal timber resources that historically have been underdeveloped, underutilized, and poorly managed, but which have proven to be resilient; and that, with proper planning, management, harvesting, value-added processing and manufacturing, and marketing, these resources will continue to grow in importance to the Commonwealth’s economy.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The General Assembly further finds that through proper attention and direction by the agencies of the Commonwealth and its public educational institutions working in partnership with secondary wood products businesses, the secondary wood products industry as a key industrial sector of the Commonwealth’s future economic growth and health, should prosper through the generation of new and expanding secondary wood products manufacturers by supporting improved management and harvesting practices, by developing and implementing workers’ training programs to upgrade the skills of Kentuckians employed in the wood products processing and manufacturing industry, by assisting the private sector to adapt existing manufacturing systems to new or improved technologies and world class management practices for the purposes of increasing product quality and productivity of Kentucky’s wood products manufacturers and processors and enhancing the global competitiveness of Kentucky secondary wood products industries.

    Notwithstanding any other provision or section of KRS 154.50-301 to 154.50-346, no governmental unit shall have the power to condemn property under KRS 154.50-301 to 154.50-346 unless the governmental unit has first given proper public notice as required by law stating the specific purpose for which the property to be condemned shall be used and said purposes shall be pleaded and proved in such condemnation action. The property shall be developed within a period of five (5) years pursuant to the purpose stated, and the failure of the authority to so develop shall entitle the person or persons whose property was condemned to repurchase the property at the price the authority paid to the governmental unit for the same. The person from whom the land is taken by condemnation shall have the right to reacquire the land as aforementioned by application to the court of competent jurisdiction, if such procedure be necessary, and shall be entitled to recovery of his costs and reasonable attorney’s fees necessary to reacquire said land.

    Kentucky Lottery Corporation, an independent, de jure municipal corporation under KRS 154A.020, did not have absolute privilege with respect to a termination memo in a defamation claim by discharged employees.

    Subdivision (1)(c) of this section was enacted in response to a concern that the integrity of the lottery might be compromised by disclosure of information bearing on the games, and not by its concern for the safety of the Lottery Corporation’s retailers; therefore, the Lottery Corporation improperly denied a request for records containing cash sales by retailers, and that it should promptly arrange for inspection of the records.

    Where an employee of the Lottery Corporation denied an open records request with only a vague reference to “certain proprietary information” and without any further explanation of how the exceptions of KRS 61.880(1) applied to the withheld information, the Lottery Corporation failed to meet its statutory burden of proof.

   <p class="p7">
    Subsection (2) of this section, which prohibits the forgery of lottery tickets, was not special legislation in violation of Ky. Const., § 59; the penalty imposed by subsection (2) of this section serves a legitimate governmental interest in maintaining the integrity of the lottery. Harris v. Commonwealth, 878 S.W.2d 801, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    When the Kentucky constitution was amended to allow for the creation of the lottery, the General Assembly could have amended KRS 516.020 to include forgery of lottery tickets. Rather than amend the existing legislation, however, it enacted subsection (2) of this section, which addresses only the forgery of lottery tickets. As it clearly would not have been special legislation to amend KRS 154A.020 to include forgery of lottery tickets, similarly this section does not constitute special legislation. Creation of a separate statutory provision is in conformity with the constitutional amendment allowing the General Assembly to promulgate legislation regulating and protecting the integrity of the lottery. Harris v. Commonwealth, 878 S.W.2d 801, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

    (4/27/2018). KRS 136.070 was repealed in 2018 Ky. Acts chs. 171 and 207, but a conforming amendment was not made to this statute to address the reference it contains to KRS 136.070. The Reviser of Statutes has determined that making such a conforming change during the 2018 codification exceeds the permissible correction of manifest clerical or typographical errors under KRS 7.136(1)(h). Therefore, the reference to KRS 136.070 remains unchanged and would have to be changed pursuant to future legislative action.
