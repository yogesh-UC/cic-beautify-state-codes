    The Legislature designed KRS 454.145 to enable a court, where the interest of justice and the orderly working of the court demand, to resort to the appointment of a special bailiff to serve a particular and specifically designated process in that particular case only, instead of the court’s having to resort to the application of KRS 454.140 or subdivision (1)(a) of this section; thus, where the court has, in its discretion as described above, appointed a special bailiff under KRS 454.145 to serve a writ of possession, that special bailiff then has the authority to so serve the writ of possession, as required under this chapter.

     Temporary restraining order — Preliminary injunction.

   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    At or after the time he files his motion for writ of possession, the plaintiff may apply for a temporary restraining order by setting forth in the motion a statement of grounds justifying the issuance of such order.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The judicial officer may issue a temporary restraining order if he determines that plaintiff’s motion for writ of possession shows the probability that there is an immediate danger that the property claimed may become unavailable to levy by reason of being transferred, concealed, or removed or may become substantially impaired in value.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    If at the hearing on issuance of the writ of possession the judicial officer determines that the plaintiff is not entitled to a writ of possession, the judicial officer shall dissolve any temporary restraining order; otherwise, he may issue a preliminary injunction to remain in effect until the property claimed is seized pursuant to the writ of possession.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)

The demand shall contain a statement in substance that the debtor has seven (7) days in which to petition the court for a hearing or in which to pay the claim in full, and that unless a hearing is set or the claim paid, an order will be sought to subject his property to payment of the claim. The statement shall identify the court in which the suit has been filed, the grounds therefor, the date of the demand, the amount of the claim, and the name and address of the plaintiff and his attorney. An affidavit of the plaintiff or his attorney evidencing compliance with this section shall be filed before an order shall be issued.

    A Chapter 7 debtor under the federal bankruptcy law can exempt and recover funds garnished from the debtor three (3) years before bankruptcy but still held by the clerk of the state court at the time of the bankruptcy petition. In re Richardson, 52 B.R. 237, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5529 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1985).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    For purposes of interpreting
    KRS 413.090(1) “execution” could mean either the act of executing an order or the writ of execution itself, which was the formal document issued by the court authorizing a sheriff to levy upon the property of a judgment debtor, as described in
    KRS 426.020. Since the term was not limited to writs of execution, but could include
    KRS 425.501(4) setting forth the procedure for obtaining garnishments, enforcement of judgments pursuant to
    KRS 426.381(2), judgment liens under
    KRS 426.720, and attachments under
    KRS 425.526, the judgment creditor was not time-barred under
    KRS 413.090(1)’s 15-year limitations period from collecting on a judgment it had against the judgment debtor, as it had pursued some of those enforcement techniques outside of a writ of execution that it had used more than 15 years earlier.

    Although the garnishment order creates a lien on the debtor’s nonexempt wages, it does not divest the debtor of his or her interest in the wages; the garnishment summons merely initiates the procedure whereby the creditor seeks to apply the debtor’s nonexempt wages in satisfaction of the underlying judgment.

    Judgment creditor could not hold a bank liable for finding funds the bank possessed were exempt from garnishment because 31 C.F.R. § 212 allowed the bank to conclusively make such a determination, preempting Ky.

    Kentucky's garnishment statutes and law are preempted by the federal regulations in 31 C.F.R. § 212 et seq. because (1) Kentucky law does not give a garnishee standing to assert an exemption on behalf of a judgment debtor, but the federal regulations require a garnishee financial institution to unilaterally determine if any funds in the institution's possession are exempted by federal law, and, (2) if a garnishee identifies money belonging to a judgment debtor, the garnishee must turn the money over to the sheriff, the attorney for the judgment creditor, or the clerk of court, but the federal regulations expressly prohibit the garnishee from turning any exempt funds over and require the garnishee to ensure that the judgment debtor has free access to those funds.

    Although the garnishment order creates a lien on the debtor’s nonexempt wages, it does not divest the debtor of his or her interest in the wages; the garnishment summons merely initiates the procedure whereby the creditor seeks to apply the debtor’s nonexempt wages in satisfaction of the underlying judgment.

   <p class="p8">
    The date of transfer is the date the garnishment lien is created, which under Kentucky law, is the date of service of the summons upon the garnishee. Wilkey v. Credit Bureau Sys. (In re Clark), 171 B.R. 563, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1397 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1994).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    According to this section, the date of transfer with regard to a garnishment is the date of service of the garnishment order upon the garnishee; thus a preferential conveyance did not occur within the 180 days preceding the bankruptcy filing as required by KRS 378.070 when the debtor was served with the garnishment over six (6) months prior to filing bankruptcy, even though garnishments were made within the 180 days.

     Procedure if garnishee indebted to defendant.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    If a garnishee, or officer of a corporation summoned as a garnishee, appear in person, he may be examined on oath; and, if it be discovered on such examination that, at the service of the order of attachment upon him, he or the corporation was possessed of any property of the defendant, or was indebted to him, the court may order the delivery of such property, and the payment, or security for the payment, of the sum owing by the garnishee, into court, or to such person as it may direct — who shall give bond, with security, for the same; or the court may permit the garnishee to retain the property or the sum owing upon the execution of a bond with one (1) or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the sum shall be paid, or the property be forthcoming, as the court may direct. Performance of such bonds, for the forthcoming of property, may be enforced, as in cases of contempt; upon such bonds for payment of money, execution may be issued as upon replevin bonds.

    For purposes of interpreting
    KRS 413.090(1) “execution” could mean either the act of executing an order or the writ of execution itself, which was the formal document issued by the court authorizing a sheriff to levy upon the property of a judgment debtor, as described in
    KRS 426.020. Since the term was not limited to writs of execution, but could include
    KRS 425.501(4) setting forth the procedure for obtaining garnishments, enforcement of judgments pursuant to
    KRS 426.381(2), judgment liens under
    KRS 426.720, and attachments under
    KRS 425.526, the judgment creditor was not time-barred under
    KRS 413.090(1)’s 15-year limitations period from collecting on a judgment it had against the judgment debtor, as it had pursued some of those enforcement techniques outside of a writ of execution that it had used more than 15 years earlier.

    Judgment creditor could not hold a bank liable for finding funds the bank possessed were exempt from garnishment because 31 C.F.R. § 212 allowed the bank to conclusively make such a determination, preempting Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 425.501(5). Deal v. First & Farmers Nat'l Bank, Inc., 518 S.W.3d 159, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 63 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    When a bank did not disclose the existence of a judgment debtor's account at the bank, which contained only funds exempt from execution, the bank was not liable for a judgment creditor's underlying judgment against the judgment debtor because the judgment creditor could not prove the judgment creditor would have been able to recover any funds from the account. Deal v. First & Farmers Nat'l Bank, Inc., 518 S.W.3d 159, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 63 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Plain language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 425.526 is clear that the statute establishes both (1) that a judgment creditor shall not be able to recover more than a garnishee owes to a judgment creditor's debtor, and (2) that in no instance can the judgment creditor obtain a judgment against the garnishee greater than the judgment against the original debtor, so the statute plainly sets a ceiling, not a floor and does not suggest in any way that the judgment creditor is automatically entitled to recover the full amount of the judgment from the garnishee irrespective of holdings of the garnishee in relation to the judgment debtor, but, in fact, states precisely the opposite. Deal v. First & Farmers Nat'l Bank, Inc., 518 S.W.3d 159, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 63 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    In order for a judgment creditor to recover an underlying judgment from a garnishee, the judgment creditor must establish that the garnishee's actions caused the creditor to suffer actual damages, which, in most cases, will be measured by the amount the garnishee failed to turn over or freeze and that the judgment creditor is able to establish the creditor would have collected under the garnishment order, but for the garnishee's failure, and the statute cannot be used to punish a garnishee for a mere technical violation that did not result in actual money or other property being wrongfully withheld from the judgment creditor. Deal v. First & Farmers Nat'l Bank, Inc., 518 S.W.3d 159, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 63 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

    For purposes of interpreting

    KRS 426.020. Since the term was not limited to writs of execution, but could include
    KRS 425.501(4) setting forth the procedure for obtaining garnishments, enforcement of judgments pursuant to
    KRS 426.381(2), judgment liens under
    KRS 426.720, and attachments under
    KRS 425.526, the judgment creditor was not time-barred under
    KRS 413.090(1)’s 15-year limitations period from collecting on a judgment it had against the judgment debtor, as it had pursued some of those enforcement techniques outside of a writ of execution that it had used more than 15 years earlier.

    The issuance of an execution is controlled by the recovering party, not by the circuit clerk. Thus, where the judgment debtor has insufficient personal property upon which execution can be had, the circuit clerk has no statutory authority to require the issuance of two executions, one for personalty and one for real estate; the one writ which the judgment plaintiff has procured (issued) will suffice.

    Although prior to adoption of KRS 382.450 requiring filing of notice of issuance and levy of execution, delay in acting upon execution of nearly three years between its issuance and acquirement of debtor’s land by bona fide purchaser would have defeated execution creditor’s rights, since adoption of that law execution creditor need not be as diligent as formerly.

    Although officer may levy on as much property as he deems necessary to satisfy execution, yet he should exercise ordinary care to ascertain value of property levied on and should not levy on property having peculiar valuable quality, as blood in horses or cows, when levy on less valuable property would suffice.

    Reason for rule that to constitute valid levy upon personal property, officer must do some act which would amount to trespass except for protection of the process is that the parties, especially the defendant, should know that levy has been made and that the property levied on should be known.

    A mere paper levy upon personal property amounts to nothing; possession or control must be taken, and mere indorsement or execution or statement to owner that levy was made on certain personal property without other action by officer was no levy.

    In an execution on personal property it is sufficient that the officer do something equivalent to a claim of dominion over the property with the power to enforce the claim but it is not necessary that he do that which amounts to a change of possession.

    In an action for the possession of specific personal property, the plaintiff may have judgment for its delivery, if it can be had; and, if not, for its value and for damages for its detention. If the property have been delivered to the plaintiff, and the defendant claim a return thereof, judgment for the defendant may be for the return of the property, or its value if a return cannot be had, and damages for the taking and withholding of the property. There shall be no pre-judgment attachment of specific personal property except under the provisions of KRS chapter 425.

    In an action for the recovery of personal property wrongfully taken under an attachment, and damages for the taking and retention thereof, it appearing that the property was mortgaged, the plaintiff was only entitled to recover damages for the detention up to the date of a judgment of foreclosure, at which time his right of possession ceased, and not up to the time of the trial of his action for damages.

    While the claim for damages might have been specifically made in the answer and counterclaim and brought down to date of restitution by amendment in an action to recover possession of a team of mules, harness, and a wagon, the successful defendant took appropriate course to secure a consideration of his claim of damages suffered through the plaintiff’s taking and detention of the property under the order of delivery 15 months before by filing a motion on the day judgment was entered, although perhaps his motion should have been more specific as to the element of damages in order that issues might have been raised thereto.

    The law is well settled that, in detinue for several articles, the value of each must be ascertained by a separate finding and the reason of the rule is evident. The judgment is in the alternative, for each article, if to be had, if not, its value, so that after the operation of a distringas, if any one article cannot be had, the court may, on proper application, supersede the distringas, and direct a fieri facias or other writ, for the value only.

It was held that the jury should have assessed the value of the property, and their omission to do so made the verdict fatally defective, and the judgment rendered thereon was erroneous. Young v.

A verdict was rendered ascertaining required information upon which the court rendered judgment fixing the amount of the recovery and said verdict was erroneous as it was in the province of the jury to fix the amount of the recovery, and the court erred in confining them to the ascertainment of the number of feet of lumber delivered.

    A sheriff who has collected money under an execution must pay it over to the execution creditor or his attorney or to any other person having his written authority on due demand, and he has no right to delay such payment of money to the person entitled to it when demand is made prior to the return date, since the purpose of the return date is merely to give the officer sufficient time to find property which will satisfy the execution and make his return thereon.

    The venditioni exponas issued after return of execution merely compelled sheriff to perform duty under original writ, it could not require him to advertise again or do any act which he had previously done. Cox v. Joiner, 7 Ky. 94, 1815 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. 1815) (decided under prior law). See Carlisle v. Carlisle, 9 Ky. Op. 167, 1876 Ky. LEXIS 380 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 1876).

   <p class="p8">
    Writ of vendoniti exponas gives no new authority to sheriff as regards sale of property upon which he made levy, but merely commands him to perform duty under original writ. Colyer v. Higgins, 62 Ky. 6, 1863 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 1863). See Irvin & Bullock v. Picket, 6 Ky. 343, 1814 Ky. LEXIS 58 (Ky. 1814); Keith v. Wilson, 60 Ky. 201, 1860 Ky. LEXIS 51 (Ky. 1860) (decided under prior law).

   <p class="p8">
    Venditioni exponas was not necessary to confer upon sheriff authority to sell under original execution that had never been returned to clerk’s office, although time for such return had expired. Bramel v. Burden, 13 Ky. Op. 477, 7 Ky. L. Rptr. 97, 1885 Ky. LEXIS 219 (Ky. Ct. App. May 21, 1885) (decided under prior law).

    A writ of venditioni exponas confers no new authority on the sheriff but merely directs him to perform his duty under the execution. Fannin's Ex'r v. Haney, 283 Ky. 68, 140 S.W.2d 630, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 277 (Ky. 1940).

    It would have been proper to permit amendment of writ of venditioni exponas issued by Bank of Kentucky, but erroneously styling plaintiff as Centre Bank of Kentucky, by striking out word “Centre,” thus making it conform to other papers giving correct name.

    The writ under this section does not vest the sheriff with any authority or duty he does not already possess by virtue of having undertaken the execution and although creditors typically provide guidance to the sheriff, the obligations to locate subject property, to levy upon it appropriately, and to conduct a valid sale are ultimately the responsibility of the sheriff alone.

    Replevin bonds required by statute are valid common-law obligations even when not executed according to statutory requirements. Issued bond, whether statutorily required or not, is good at common law if executed voluntarily for valid consideration, and not repugnant to letter or policy of law. Thompson v.

    Replevin bonds, postponing payment of judgment for six (6) months and not three, were not statutory bonds upon which execution could issue, but were common-law bonds binding upon obligators after plaintiff had refrained for six (6) months from enforcing judgment.

   <p class="p8">
    Replevin bonds which postponed payment of a judgment for six (6) months rather than three are not statutory bonds which can be subject to execution but are common-law bonds which bind the obligor if plaintiff has not enforced the judgment within six (6) months.

    The defendant may replevy a money judgment, if an execution thereon has not been placed in the hands of a collecting officer, for three months before the police judge entering the judgment, by giving bond with good surety to be approved by the judge. OAG 65-177.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where a defendant is convicted and does not replevy and does not pay the fine and costs, he shall be put in jail. And he is given a credit of $2.00 or $1.00 per day, depending upon whether he is worked or not, toward the payment of the fine and costs. If that occurs, i.e., if he satisfies such costs by merely being in jail, or working in jail, it means that the arresting officer would not recover his arresting fees because the county is not responsible for paying the costs, including arresting fees and thus the arresting fees will go unpaid. OAG 67-175.

    In a replevin bond, the judge shall provide for legal interest. OAG 68-526.

   <p class="p8">
    Under KRS 534.020 a judge may find someone guilty and then legally allow the fine to be paid in monthly installments but if no such provision for paying the fine is made a part of the sentence, the fine shall be payable forthwith except when the defendant makes a satisfactory replevin bond under this section but when a replevin bond is not executed and defendant defaults in paying the fine, under KRS 534.060 the court may require the defendant to show cause why he should not be imprisoned for nonpayment. OAG 75-4.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The suretyship on a replevin bond may not be conditioned on the principal not being taken into custody on another charge and the surety, whether he be gratuitous or paid, has no right to request that he be removed as surety if the principal/defendant is in custody on another charge. OAG 75-296.

    In a divorce action, regardless of whether the land ordered sold is “restoration of property” to a spouse or is a division of property between the spouses, no appraisement under this section is necessary. OAG 76-609.

    A sheriff is not personally or officially responsible for court costs, including the expense of advertising and appraisers’ fees in connection with a judicial sale of property in which he participates at the direction of the court; such items are a part of the costs, subject to the directions of the court as to who has to pay them.

    The phrase “intelligent housekeeper of the county” as used in subsection (1) of this section requires a subjective evaluation of an appraiser’s qualifications rather than a strict application of rules of domicile. OAG 96-31.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The legislature did not intend the phrase “intelligent housekeepers of the county” contained in subsection (1) of this section to carry a precise, objective meaning. The statutory language is intended to provide subjective guidance to the master commissioner in selecting persons to serve as appraisers. If the master commissioner believes that a person’s general aptitude and knowledge of the county, whether derived through business activities, real estate management, or actual residency, qualifies the person to appraise real property, then the person is an “intelligent housekeeper of the county” within the meaning of the statute. OAG 96-31.

     Mortgage foreclosure forbidden — Rights of mortgagee after default.

   <li class="p6">
    Foreclosure of a mortgage is forbidden; provided, however, that this section shall not preclude a mortgagee after default from taking possession of property subject to the mortgage which has been abandoned by the mortgagor, for the purpose of preserving and maintaining the same, harvesting crops, or letting the same, all to the account of the mortgagor; and any reasonable expenses incident thereto including taxes and insurance shall be added to the principal of the mortgage, and secured by it. For the purpose of this section, property shall be deemed to have been abandoned when the mortgagor has moved from the property and when by the nature of the property in question when further neglect or failure to attend will decrease its value. Any right a mortgagee acquires in a tenant’s interest in crops raised on shares is inferior to any prior existing lien of the landlord on the tenant’s interest.

    In an action against sureties in an indemnifying bond, where it was shown that an execution was issued upon a judgment and was levied upon a stock of goods and later the execution defendant obtained a discharge in bankruptcy, the court determined that a discharge in bankruptcy did not discharge the levy of execution and did not affect the right of a judgment creditor to recover on claimant’s bond.

    Where an execution has been levied upon a stock of merchandise, the execution of a claimant’s bond does not prevent the sheriff from proceeding against other property of the defendants, nor from allowing them to replevy the debt, but the entire satisfaction of the execution is not entire satisfaction of the bond if the sale was wrongfully suspended by its execution.

   <p class="p8">
    Where the pleadings in an action to enforce liens not only showed that the property was residence property but alleged that it could not be divided without impairing its value, and the allegation was not denied, and none of the parties were infants, the chancellor was justified in adjudging the property indivisible, since the court could determine that question from the pleadings of the case. Salyer v. Union Bank, 149 Ky. 847, 150 S.W. 14, 1912 Ky. LEXIS 731 (Ky. 1912).

    An allegation that the land is divisible, or indivisible, is not required to be made by the pleadings, in an action to foreclose a vendor’s lien. If the court is satisfied, from the character of the boundary, or the number of acres in the tract, as described in the pleadings, that a division can be had, it is all that is required. Sears v. Henry, 76 Ky. 413, 1877 Ky. LEXIS 78 (Ky. 1877).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the petition gives such a description of the land sought to be subjected that the court may, from the description given, determine whether or not the land is susceptible of advantageous division, the allegation in that regard need not be made. Cockrill v. Mize, 12 S.W. 1040, 11 Ky. L. Rptr. 637 (1890).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The petition need not expressly aver whether the property is, or is not, divisible, as this may appear by the description of the property in the pleading. Lucy v. Hopkins, 13 S.W. 518, 11 Ky. L. Rptr. 907 (1890).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    In an action to enforce a lien against property, it is not necessary to allege that the property is indivisible and the court may order sale of part of the tract where it is satisfied from the character of the boundaries or the number of acres that a division may be made; therefore, in the absence of allegation or proof, the court was authorized to find that a 34 1/2-acre tract was divisible. Mays v. Carman, 66 S.W. 1019, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 2216, 1902 Ky. LEXIS 536 (Ky. Ct. App. 1902).

    It is not necessary to allege in the pleadings in an action to enforce a tax lien that the property was divisible or indivisible. Will v. Louisville, 176 Ky. 450, 195 S.W. 822, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 68 (Ky. 1917).

    Where it was evident that the land could have been divided and there was no evidence upon which to base the conclusion that a division was impracticable, and the debtor had been prejudiced by the order of the court directing a sale of the entire tract, it was the duty of the court, upon exceptions filed to the commissioner’s report, to set aside the sale, although made in strict conformity to the judgment, as the court, notwithstanding the judgment, had complete control over the mere manner of conducting the sale until the report of sale had been confirmed. Vanmeter v. Vanmeter's Assignee, 88 Ky. 448, 11 S.W. 80, 10 Ky. L. Rptr. 906, 1889 Ky. LEXIS 37 (Ky. 1889).

   <p class="p8">
    In an action for the sale of real property, where there is no allegation in the pleadings with reference to the divisibility of the property and no issue made with reference to that question, but the court determines the question as to divisibility, and it appears upon exceptions to the report of sale that the land was divisible without material impairment of its value and was erroneously ordered sold as a whole, and the error has resulted in the land being sold for a grossly inadequate price, it is the duty of the court to set aside the sale and correct the error, although the sale has been made in conformity with the order of sale. Harris v. Louisville Trust Co., 181 Ky. 659, 205 S.W. 772, 1918 Ky. LEXIS 594 (Ky. 1918).

    Where there was no allegation in the petition, and no evidence in any form, that the real estate on which a materialman’s lien had attached could not be divided without materially impairing its value, and by the judgment the chancellor adjudged a sale of only enough of the property to satisfy the debt, amounting to $965, but under that judgment the commissioner sold the entire tract, which brought $3,300, such sale was not authorized. Dallas v. Gardner, 207 Ky. 93, 268 S.W. 847, 1925 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1925).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the judgment expressly limited the authority of the commissioner to sell only enough of the mortgaged land to satisfy the debt and there was nothing to show that the land could not be divided without materially affecting its value, but the commissioner sold the entire tract of land which brought several hundred dollars in excess of the amount of the debt, the chancellor erred in overruling the defendant’s exceptions to the report of sale. Rhinehart v. Stacy, 213 Ky. 684, 281 S.W. 809, 1926 Ky. LEXIS 594 (Ky. 1926).

   <p class="p8">
    Where a commissioner was ordered to sell real estate to satisfy a judgment, there was no showing that the real estate was indivisible, and all of the real estate was sold for an amount greater than the total of the judgment, interest, and costs, the sale was irregular. Barnett v. Bank of Commerce, 264 Ky. 179, 94 S.W.2d 334, 1936 Ky. LEXIS 289 (Ky. 1936).

    In an action to subject real property to the payment of debt, the court must be satisfied as to whether or not the property can be divided without materially impairing its value, but where it does not affirmatively appear in the record that the court passed upon the question in ordering sale of a large number of platted lots in bulk, it was error, but did not render the judgment void; since the lots did not bring enough to pay plaintiff’s debt, interest, and costs, it may be presumed that the owner lost nothing by the error.

    Where the order of sale might appropriately have directed a sale of a sufficiency of the defendant’s three (3) lots to satisfy a mortgage debt rather than the whole of the property, as such property was divisible and had an appraised value much greater than the debt, and the property when sold as a whole brought less than one half (1/2) of its appraised value, but the defendant agreed both to the sale of the property as a whole and to its purchase by the plaintiff at less than two thirds (2/3) of its appraised value, the defendant was not in position to complain of the sale after its confirmation.

    Where it is sought to sell land in satisfaction of a junior mortgage lien which has matured, when a senior mortgage lien owned by a different person, which has not matured, exists upon the land, although the land may be divisible, a sale of no part of it could be had free from encumbrance without prejudice to the prior lienhold because it would be impossible to foretell how much of the encumbered lands would be necessary to satisfy the prior lien at its maturity.

    The plaintiff in an action to enforce a lien on real property shall state in his petition the liens, if any, which are held thereon by others, and make the holders defendants; and no sale of the property shall be ordered by the court prejudicial to the rights of the holders of any of the liens, and when it appears from the petition or otherwise, that several debts are secured by one (1) lien, or by liens of equal rank, and they are all due at the commencement of the action, or become so before judgment, the court shall order the sale for the pro rata satisfaction of all of them, but if, in such case, the debts be owned by different persons and be not all due, the court shall not order a sale of the property until they all mature. If all such liens be held by the same party, the court may order a sale of enough of the property to pay the debts then due, unless it appear that it is not susceptible of advantageous division, or that, for some other reason, the sale would cause a sacrifice thereof, or seriously prejudice the interests of the defendants, but the holder of a prior lien may enforce the same when the debt thereby secured is due, notwithstanding the existence of inferior liens, whether the debts secured thereby are due or not; and the holder of an inferior lien, when the debt thereby secured is due, may enforce the same by a sale of land subject to a prior lien or liens thereon, where the debt or debts secured thereby are not yet due. Provided, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any liens now of record.

    In an action to foreclose a vendor’s lien securing two notes, both owned by the plaintiff, one of which was not due, instead of ordering a sale of all or part of the land to satisfy a part only of the plaintiff’s debts, reserving a lien and consequent encumbrance on the land in his favor for the residue of the indebtedness, the court should have simply directed a sale of enough of the land to pay the debts and costs then adjudged, leaving the remaining note to its lien on the remaining portion of the land. Emison v. Risque, 72 Ky. 24, 1872 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 1872) (decided under prior law).

    In an action to enforce a lien for purchase money upon a tract of land, where there are no other liens known to the plaintiff, the better practice is to state that fact in the petition. Baird v. Prewitt, 158 Ky. 793, 166 S.W. 771, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 726 (Ky. 1914).

    Where plaintiff recovered judgment, had its attachment and levy sustained, and then took no action for three (3) years when it brought a new action to determine the rights of the judgment debtor’s transferee and the priority between its lien and a lien executed after the judgment, the court properly dismissed the action, because this question should have been submitted to the court through amendments of the pleadings in the original action.

    Where real estate is sold to enforce a junior lien, the thing that is sold is the debtor’s equity in the realty, subject to the prior lien; the property must be appraised as a whole and the purchaser, in order to cut off the debtor’s right of redemption and obtain a deed, must bid at least two thirds of the value of the debtor’s equity as computed by deducting the amount of the prior lien from the total appraised value. Hardwick v. Fitzpatrick, 279 Ky. 53, 129 S.W.2d 1006, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 232 (Ky. 1939).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Trial court improperly confirmed a judicial sale without making it subject to a senior mortgage because, while an assignee and its predecessor failed to bring their claim in the foreclosure proceedings initiated by a junior mortgagee and therefore had a default judgment entered against them, the assignee’s presentation of its claim prior to the judicial sale was sufficient to prevent its senior mortgage from being extinguished by the junior mortgagee’s foreclosure action.

Rowlett v. Harris, 121 Ky. 811, 90 S.W. 562, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 780, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 264 (Ky. 1906).

    In an action to enforce a vendor’s lien when some of the purchase money notes are not due, if it appears that the land is not susceptible of advantageous division, the court should not order a sale of it, or any part of it, until the maturity of all notes, although all are held by the same person.

    When it developed, in an action to set aside deeds and ordering land sold, that there were outstanding liens on the property, the court should have required these lienholders to be made parties before ordering a sale in order that their rights might be protected, and the judgment was erroneous to the extent that it ignored their rights.

    The interest of a pendente lite lienholder in real property does not survive the judicial sale of the property incident to a foreclosure action to which the lienholder was neither a party nor had actual notice of the proceedings. While this section clearly requires the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to name the holders of other liens in its petition, there is no statutory requirement to name those who acquire a lien after the filing of the petition.

    A sale of dividend paying securities by a personal representative, after securing authority by a proper ex parte proceeding, is not a judicial sale in any sense, and thus, this section is not applicable to such sales. Barth v. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co., 188 Ky. 788, 224 S.W. 351, 1920 Ky. LEXIS 353 (Ky. 1920).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    This section applies only to judicial sales and not to sales under execution. Mason v. Letcher Coal & Coke Co., 196 Ky. 629, 245 S.W. 130, 1922 Ky. LEXIS 550 (Ky. 1922).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The provisions of KRS 426.200 as to sale of land on the first day of a court term do not apply to sales under this section and, therefore, a decree authorizing the master commissioner to select a day for the sale was not erroneous. Fisher v. Shanks, 210 Ky. 338, 275 S.W. 803, 1925 Ky. LEXIS 669 (Ky. 1925).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where executor acted under authority given him in the will and not under judgment, sale under this section was not necessary. Methodist Episcopal Church South v. McAdams, 263 Ky. 833, 94 S.W.2d 11, 1936 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 1936).

   <p class="p8">
    Where the judgment ordering the sale of real estate directed the commissioner to sell on a credit of six (6) months and to take bond payable to himself but gave no direction as to the time and place of sale except to direct the commissioner to post notices of the time, place and terms of sale, as sheriffs are required to do before selling land under execution, it was sufficient. Barnes v. Jackson's Administrator, 85 Ky. 407, 3 S.W. 601, 9 Ky. L. Rptr. 33, 1887 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Ct. App. 1887).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The judgment should be so explicit in regard to property ordered to be sold, as well as to the time, terms, and place of sale, so that the commissioner should not be required to look to any other paper or order for directions. Meyer v. Covington, 103 Ky. 546, 45 S.W. 769, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 239, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1898). See Neff v. Covington Stone & Sand Co., 108 Ky. 457, 55 S.W. 697, 1900 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. Ct. App. 1900).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where it does not appear from the record that there was any objection to the judgment designating the manner of the sale, nor that there was any sacrifice of property, it cannot be presumed that the court would disregard the plain provisions of this section as to credit, time and place in the sale of personal property. Hardin v. Bond, 56 S.W. 676, 22 Ky. L. Rptr. 117 (1900).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A judgment ordering a sale on foreclosure should direct upon what time or credit the land should be sold. Quigley v. Beam's Adm'r, 137 Ky. 325, 125 S.W. 727, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 575 (Ky. 1910).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Judgments ordering real estate to be sold should be specific, and if they are uncertain to such an extent that they cannot be carried out without doubt as to the meaning, they are void. Alexander v. Hendricks, 201 Ky. 677, 258 S.W. 81, 1924 Ky. LEXIS 606 (Ky. 1924).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Judgment was erroneous which did not describe the property or specify the terms or time of the sale or for what sum of money it was to be made. Piersall v. Piersall, 302 Ky. 486, 194 S.W.2d 627, 1946 Ky. LEXIS 660 (Ky. 1946).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Had a judgment authorized the sale of land for cash, or on less than six (6) months’ credit, it would have been erroneous and reversible on appeal, unless it was clearly shown the error was not prejudicial. Miller v. Halsey, 327 S.W.2d 943, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 80 (Ky. 1959) (decision prior to 1970 amendment).

    Where the judgment of sale identified the real property to be sold as a “house and lot on Mulberry Street, in Lexington,” the description was insufficient. Faught v. Henry, 76 Ky. 471, 1877 Ky. LEXIS 124 (Ky. 1877).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the land to be sold was described in metes and bounds, both in the petition and in the judgment, and the land was sufficiently identified to enable the commissioner to locate it and there was no showing that the defendant was prejudiced by the failure to give a fuller description, the judgment will not be disturbed for that reason. Posey v. Green, 78 Ky. 162, 1879 Ky. LEXIS 79 (Ky. 1879).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the decree adjudging a sale of real estate to satisfy a lien described the property as “beginning at Pike street, on the east side of York street, in this city, running thence N. 2961/2 feet, more or less,” such description was insufficient. Meyer v. Covington, 103 Ky. 546, 45 S.W. 769, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 239, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1898).

   <p class="p8">
    Where the judgment of the court directed that a deposit of $200 be made by the purchaser, it constituted a harmless error, since there was no evidence that the interest of the owner was prejudiced by this requirement. Guest v. Foster, 159 Ky. 1, 166 S.W. 620, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 730 (Ky. 1914).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the judgment ordered the sale of property to be made to the highest bidder for cash in hand, and further provided that any purchaser at the judicial sale should be required to make a deposit of $100, such judgment was not authorized by this section, but did not constitute reversible error. The Court of Appeals directed the lower court to correct the judgment. Young v. Fitch, 182 Ky. 29, 206 S.W. 29, 1918 Ky. LEXIS 318 (Ky. 1918), overruled,
    Greene v. Stevenson, 295 Ky. 832, 175 S.W.2d 519, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 348 (Ky. 1943).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the judgment ordering the sale of attached property directed that prospective purchasers would be required to deposit $100 with the special commissioner before the beginning of the sale, such judgment was erroneous and the sale should have been set aside on this ground, even though the commissioner making the sale ignored that part of the judgment and did not require a deposit. Kengreen Gas Utilities Corp. v. Crozer, 244 Ky. 440, 51 S.W.2d 262, 1932 Ky. LEXIS 447 (Ky. 1932).

   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    Under this statute the court is without power to require the purchaser to pay one-fifth of the price on the day of sale, and this would be peculiarly prejudicial in the sale of large properties. Wakenva Coal Co. v. Johnson, 234 Ky. 558, 28 S.W.2d 737, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 219 (Ky. 1930).

   <p class="p8">
    Where property was sold for $10,000 more than the highest appraisal of it by admittedly competent appraisers, the fact that the court order for the sale required it to be for cash was not prejudicial and, therefore, not reversible error. Call v. Call, 367 S.W.2d 274, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1963) (decision prior to 1970 amendment).

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Where the advertisement of the master commissioner in a sale made in a suit to settle the decedent’s estate failed to state the amount of money to be raised by the sale, the purchaser was not in position to have the sale set aside on that ground. Connell v. Harper, 202 Ky. 406, 259 S.W. 1017, 1924 Ky. LEXIS 727 (Ky. 1924).

    Debtors were entitled to avoid a judgment lien on their property under 11 USCS § 522(f) because, on two separate occasions, the creditor failed to strictly comply with the notice requirements of KRS 426.720. Because the lien was defective, it did not survive Chapter 7 discharge as an in rem claim. In re Steele, 402 B.R. 775, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 803 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 2009).

    Although the creditor contended it timely instituted an action to enforce the lien, in fact it filed an action for breach of the Agreement against debtor. The filing of the Notice of Judgment Lien allowed the creditor to assert a judgment lien against debtor's real property pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat.

    For purposes of interpreting

    KRS 426.020. Since the term was not limited to writs of execution, but could include
    KRS 425.501(4) setting forth the procedure for obtaining garnishments, enforcement of judgments pursuant to
    KRS 426.381(2), judgment liens under
    KRS 426.720, and attachments under
    KRS 425.526, the judgment creditor was not time-barred under
    KRS 413.090(1)’s 15-year limitations period from collecting on a judgment it had against the judgment debtor, as it had pursued some of those enforcement techniques outside of a writ of execution that it had used more than 15 years earlier.

    Circuit court properly denied a judgment debtor's motion, corrected a clerical error regarding judgment interest, and granted a judgment and order of sale to enforce an estate's judgment lien against the debtor's real property because the statute clearly contemplated the judicial sale of the real property subject to a judgment lien, upon filing a notice of judgment lien in the county clerk's office, the lien automatically attached to all real property owned by the debtor in the county where filed, and the alleged deficiencies in the judgment lien notice were merely a matter of form, not content.

    Debtor’s claim that the retroactive applicability of subsection (4) of this section was a taking of property without due process of law was without merit, where under the applicable state law the household goods in question were not exempt at the time the lien was created on May 16, 1979, nor were they exempt pursuant to the state’s statutory exemption scheme on May 3, 1983, when the debtor’s petition in bankruptcy was filed.

    Subsection (4) of this section, which denies to debtors bankruptcy exemptions in property subject to consensual liens, clearly lies beyond any of the 29 enumerated types of “special legislation” specifically prohibited by Ky.

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    KRS 427.010(2)(a) was a Kentucky garnishment statute, limited to pre-bankruptcy actions by creditors; once debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, KRS 427.010(2) did not protect her post-petition federal tax refund from the trustee’s reach. Thus, debtor could not claim an exemption for her 2003 tax refund under the statute. 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 1350.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    KRS 427.010(2)(a) was virtually identical to the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA), 15 USCS §§ 1671-77, which was meant to prevent bankruptcies, not to function within the bankruptcy process, and there was no reason to believe that the General Assembly intended KRS 427.010(2) to be read differently than the CCPA, upon which it was clearly modeled. Absent a showing of the General Assembly’s intent to allow KRS 427.010(2) to continue in the bankruptcy process, debtor could not utilize the garnishment statute to protect her post-petition federal income tax refund from the trustee’s reach. 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 1350.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The exemption under KRS 427.010 did not apply to the recovery of an insurance fraud claim worth approximately $5,000 which was not reported during the course of the bankruptcy case, but was only raised after the case was reopened by the trustee. The court found this exemption was claimed in bad faith considering debtor failed to disclose the asset at a time when she knew it existed. In re Keith, 336 B.R. 746, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 79 (Bankr.

    If a motor vehicle is valued at more than $1,500, then it is subject to distraint under KRS 134.430 to the extent of the value in excess of $1,500, but the sheriff would have to turn back to the owner any sale proceeds up to the $1,500 exempted amount and any excess over the $1,500 after the payment of the tax claim.

    When the Kentucky Legislature enacted this section, its inclusion of the words, “similar plan or contract” simply evidenced legislative intent not to restrict exempt status to only those arrangements specifically enumerated within the statute, and the provisions of this section are entitled to an expansive reading.

    The legislature in enacting this section did not intend to restrict exempt status to only those arrangements expressly set forth therein, since it recognized the existence of other sophisticated benefit systems regardless of their generic term under the all-encompassing phrase “similar plan or contract” in subdivision (1)(b). To be thus included the similar plan or contract must possess the characteristics of those programs expressly stated or be so parallel in nature as to serve the same goals or purposes.

    The sophistication of deferred compensation plans and programs precludes an exhaustive identification of such arrangements, and thus, the phrase “similar plan or contract” in subdivision (1)(b) must by its adoption include those plans closely parallel in nature to the specifics named. It is well recognized that Individual Retirement Account (IRA) accounts do possess these traits in that benefits through contributions of a tax-deferred nature do flow to the debtor and his dependents under a formalized plan conditioned upon certain prospective elections or future events, and mandating that such accounts to be deemed a qualified plan must adhere to rigid requirements monitored by the Internal Revenue Service.

    The Bankruptcy Court must apply the Kentucky state exemption statute in bankruptcy cases; thus, exemptions pursuant to 11 USCS § 522(d) are not alternatively available to Kentucky debtors. In re Raymond, 103 B.R. 846, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1485 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Court of appeals erred in affirming an order granting a debtor’s challenge to a garnishment under KRS 427.170 on the ground that exemptions allowed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), and incorporated by reference into KRS 427.170, were available to any individual debtor domiciled in Kentucky because KRS 427.170, as modified in 2005, authorized only Kentucky residents in bankruptcy cases to avail themselves of the exemptions specified under § 522(d), and such exemptions were not otherwise available to debtors in Kentucky; the Legislature’s incorporation of § 522(d) into KRS 427.170 by reference thereto, created an ambiguity because it is not clear from the statute alone if the General Assembly intended to also assimilate the federal definitions embodied in the federal statute, or if it intended otherwise, and the legislative record strongly suggests that the Legislature simply chose to “opt-in” the federal exemptions in bankruptcy cases, and to defer for future consideration any other change in the exemptions otherwise allowed under state law.

    Since the Commonwealth has chosen to opt out of the federal list of exemptions entirely, the district court has to look to KRS 427.060 to determine whether the debtor is entitled to an exemption before 11 USCS § 522(f) can be applied.

    Lien avoidance matters regarding nonpossessory, nonpurchase money liens on personal property may be decided on motion as the requirement of filing an adversary proceeding is a harsh, and likely unintended, result of the legislature’s “opt out” of the federal exemption scheme.

    Kentucky homestead exemption was available to eligible debtors at the time a petition under the Bankruptcy Code was filed where there was no pending sale of the residence; therefore, debtors were entitled to have their motions to avoid the judicial liens of the respective creditors avoided to the extent that the liens impair these valid homestead exemptions.
