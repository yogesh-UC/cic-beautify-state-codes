    A districting act objected to as unconstitutional must be assailed within a reasonable time after its passage; 13 years afterward is too late. Adams v. Bosworth, 126 Ky. 61, 102 S.W. 861, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 518, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 20 (Ky. 1907).

    Since the population deviations resulting from reapportionment law were in violation of the “one man one vote” principle and did not measure up to the “as nearly as practicable” standard, and since the reason for these deviations — that district’s population would equalize itself in future — was not acceptable unless such a prediction could be made with a high degree of accuracy and unless similar predictions were made for every other district in the state, such reapportionment law was unconstitutional.

   </h4>
   <p class="p10">
    Since the population deviations resulting from reapportionment law were in violation of the “one man one vote” principle and did not measure up to the “as nearly as practicable” standard, and since the reason for these deviations — that district’s population would equalize itself in future — was not acceptable unless such a prediction could be made with a high degree of accuracy and unless similar predictions were made for every other district in the state, such reapportionment law was unconstitutional. Hensley v. Wood, 329 F. Supp. 787, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12293 (E.D. Ky. 1971).

    Unfair division of the state into representative districts is not a problem which is outside the jurisdiction of courts. Ragland v. Anderson, 125 Ky. 141, 100 S.W. 865, 30 Ky. L. Rptr. 1199, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 273 (Ky. 1907).

    When a legislative district embraces a ward or wards of a city, its boundary is determined by reference to the ward or wards as they were constituted at the time of the districting. Mullen v. McDonald, 101 Ky. 87, 39 S.W. 698, 19 Ky. L. Rptr. 224, 1897 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 1897).

    A citizen, taxpayer and voter may challenge the constitutionality of a redistricting act. Stiglitz v. Schardien, 239 Ky. 799, 40 S.W.2d 315, 1931 Ky. LEXIS 849 (Ky. 1931).
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The Secretary of State, the State Board of Election Commissioners and the Attorney General are not the proper officials against whom the assailant of a redistricting act should file an action, when those officers have no duty to perform in respect to the practical operation of the act.

    When a districting act as passed by the legislature contains an obvious mistake, the court will interpret the act in such a way as to effectuate the legislative intent. Neutzel v. Ryans, 184 Ky. 292, 211 S.W. 852, 1919 Ky. LEXIS 65 (Ky. 1919).

    Each legislator in office on July 1, 1980, may within thirty (30) days after that date, and any legislator thereafter taking office may within thirty (30) days after the date thereof, elect to make monthly contributions to the Legislators’ Retirement Plan, in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of his monthly creditable compensation, as defined in KRS 61.510(13), or the amount specified by paragraph (d) of this subsection. The election shall be effective to establish membership in the plan as of July 1, 1980, or as of the date from which the thirty (30) day period is measured, as the case may be. Provided, however, that any legislator who was in office on July 1, 1980, and who is in office at the time he makes the election may, after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period and until May 1, 1982, make the election, in which event he shall pay to the Legislators’ Retirement Plan, for the months between July 1, 1980, and the date of his election such sum as, when added to any member’s contribution by him that is transferred from another retirement system under KRS 6.535, will equal the member’s contribution required by this section. If the member makes his election after February 1, 1981, he shall in addition pay to the plan interest on the foregoing sum, at six percent (6%) per annum, calculated as if the sum consisted of equal monthly payments, one (1) of which was due at the end of each month between July 1, 1980, and the date the election was made. The election shall be addressed to and filed with the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and shall constitute an authorization to the secretary to thereafter cause to be deducted from the member’s monthly creditable compensation an amount equal to five percent (5%) thereof, as a voluntarily elected contribution by the member towards the funding of the Legislators’ Retirement Plan.

In such event, the Kentucky Employees Retirement System shall transfer to the Legislators’ Retirement Plan an amount equal to the employer’s contributions that originally were made to the Kentucky Employees Retirement System for the regained service credit, with interest as provided in KRS 6.535.

Service credit awarded as provided in this subsection shall be equivalent, for all purposes of the Legislators’ Retirement Plan, to other service credit earned in the plan. The service in the military reserves or the National Guard shall be treated as service earned prior to participation in the plan. The purchase can be made by the member by transfer, if authorized under subsection (7)(d) of this section, or in a lump-sum payment or by installment payments, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

If the member leaves office before completing his installment payments, he may satisfy his contract by a lump-sum payment of the remaining principal amount, but no further installment payments shall be accepted thereafter. In this case, the member shall be credited with the military service credit for which he has paid, in years or months but no fraction less than a full month, and any payment remaining after credit for full months has been awarded shall be returned to the member.

    (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    (7/1/2013). Section 17 of
    2013 Ky. Acts ch. 120 amended the opening sentence of this statute to insert “Section 12 of this Act” into the list of KRS sections whose terms govern the Legislators Retirement Plan. Section 12 of that Act created
    KRS 21.402. However, the Reviser of Statutes has not inserted a specific reference to
    KRS 21.402 in this list, since the list contains a range of statutes (
    KRS 21.370 to
    21.410) that includes

    The purpose and function of the Kentucky Code of Legislative Ethics and the Executive Branch Code of Ethics is not to restrict or prohibit appropriate and protected communications of the lobbyists; instead, the Commonwealth’s compelling interest in insuring the proper operation of a democratic government and deterring corruption is protected by these narrowly tailored sections, which require only that one who receives compensation and/or expends funds in lobbying must register and report the nature and extent of his activities.

    The need to properly identify and regulate compensated lobbyist groups in order to preserve and maintain the integrity of government constitutes a compelling state interest, which validates this classification and does not violate the lobbyist groups’ equal protection rights.

    Exception permitted associations and facilitated speech between lobbyists and legislators without undercutting Kentucky’s stated interest or abridging associational freedoms; through this carve out, Kentucky encouraged interactions that were less likely to raise concerns about actual or apparent corruption.

    Catch-all provision was not void for vagueness because a person of ordinary intelligence would know that this language, used in both legal and common parlance, barred them from accepting or soliciting money or a gift that served as payment for a service provided; and the additional phrase “or the primary significance of which is economic gain” did not muddy the waters.

    Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

    Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

    Because this provision did nothing more than recognize that lobbyists and their employers and narrowly-defined PACs were paid to persuade legislators, not to purchase them, and that contributions made by these power players during an active session were particularly likely to give rise to the appearance of corruption, this time-limited ban was closely drawn.

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex.

Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

    Because the precursor to former KRS 45.360, former KRS 42.060, did not contain a criminal penalty for a violation of the statute, and since the criminal penalty was included in KRS 45.990(3) for the first time in a reviser’s bill, the reviser’s bill impermissibly resulted in a substantive change.

    The intent of KRS 7.310 to 7.380 is to insure systematic and thorough evaluations of agencies of the state government and their various programs for the purpose of furnishing the Legislature with factual information necessary to the discharge of its legislative duties. The General Assembly finds that adequate information is not available for each session through which the members of the Legislature can determine the needs of the various agencies and departments of the state government, and the effectiveness of their programs. The General Assembly also finds that the legislative session is not adequate time in which to review the financial operations of each agency. It is the intent of KRS 7.310 to 7.380 to provide the Legislature with adequate factual information by which to exercise its valid powers.

    (9/2/94). By letter of September 2, 1994, the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, acting under KRS 48.500, advised the Reviser of Statutes of his determination “that no funds appropriated by the Executive Branch Appropriations Act for the 1995-96 biennium can be identified as having been appropriated for the purpose of implementing Sections 1 to 7 of House Bill No. 616, Chapter (296), Acts of the 1994 Regular Session of the General Assembly.” Accordingly, the amendment to this statute contained in 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 296 is void under sec. 3(8) of that Act and has not been codified into the statute.

    If there is school board opposition to school based decision making (SBDM) the SBDM council could seek assistance from the Office of Education Accountability and if they cannot assist the council, then legal action should be considered to force the school board to comply with the statute; however, that should not be necessary once the statute contains protections within it. OAG 91-24.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Based on the language of Ky. Const., § 183 and on case law interpreting this section, the General Assembly has authorization to create the Office of Education Accountability. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Superintendents and boards are subject to investigation by legislative agencies, but those agencies, in this case the Office of Education Accountability, may not take enforcement action against them. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The activities of the Office of Education Accountability do not violate the separation of powers set forth in Ky. Const., §§ 27 and 28. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The authority under which superintendents and boards must respond to questions raised in the course of investigation by the Office of Education Accountability is found in this section and KRS 6.905 et seq. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The discovery powers set forth in subsection (2)(d) (now (2)(e)) of this section are broad; however, they relate to the ability of the arm of the legislature to study the implementation of the Reform Act, and to insure that the General Assembly is successful in creating an “efficient system of common schools,” as mandated by Ky. Const., § 183. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    While the Office of Education Accountability does not have the right to perform the executive functions of regulating and supervising administration of the day to day operations of school districts, the office may study and monitor the implementation of the Kentucky Education Reform Act. OAG 91-222.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    Subsection (3) vests virtually unfettered discretion in the Office of Education Accountability to withhold records relating to its duties and responsibilities while an investigation is pending, and after it has concluded; the urgency and importance of this provision is further underscored by the fact that in 1992, the General Assembly elected to make it retroactive to July 13, 1990, and to include an emergency clause making it effective upon passage by the Governor; thus, a teacher’s request to have full access to records pertaining to a complaint filed against her was properly denied. OAG 98-ORD-149.
   </p>
   <p class="p10">
    The Office of Education Accountability properly denied a request for access to intra-office memorandum and the identity of an informant, which related to the requester’s attempt to hack into or invade the agency’s computer system. OAG 99-ORD-96.

    The growing complexity and interdependence of the modern world, demonstrated by such issues as global environmental change, changing workforce development needs, the aging population, international trade, the number of working poor, the need for improved access to health care, and the emergence of fundamental changes in the role of government, require that government decision-makers consider the long-term changes affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and bring these factors to bear upon public policy;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    There is a need to coordinate state government’s information resources to provide a systematic and comprehensive use of that information to guide policymakers concerning critical trends and alternative futures;
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    To effect a prosperous future for the Commonwealth and its citizens, it is necessary for changes to occur in the way decisions are made in government so policymakers can consider the long-term implications of decisions and address emerging issues so the Commonwealth can take advantage of opportunities, avoid problems, and provide for continuity in policy; and
   </p>
   <p class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    It is necessary to establish mechanisms to bring all perspectives into the decision-making process to evaluate information, focus attention on areas in which information is inadequate, and identify critical trends and alternative futures based upon the best available information.
