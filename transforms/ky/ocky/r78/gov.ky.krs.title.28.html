   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    The General Assembly hereby declares:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The venting of coalbed methane and degasification of coal seams is approved by the Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring the safe recovery of coal;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    The positive economic impact of coal mining to the Commonwealth is currently greater than that of coalbed methane production;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    Coalbed methane is not found in conventional gas reservoirs;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    Any development of coalbed methane should be undertaken in a way to protect and preserve the environment and protect and preserve the coal for future safe mining and the maximum recovery of coal;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    Commercial recovery and marketing of coalbed methane should be facilitated whenever appropriate to meet the energy needs of both the Commonwealth and the United States;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (f)
    </span>
    The extraction of methane from mineable coal enhances mine safety, promotes environmental goals and objectives, and conserves an important energy resource; and
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (g)
    </span>
    The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was enacted, in part, to encourage coalbed methane development and the Commonwealth should enact legislation to carry out the purpose of that act.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    Therefore, in order to encourage and ensure the fullest practical safe recovery of both coal and coalbed methane, consistent with the above declarations and findings, this chapter is established to:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    Authorize coalbed methane well permits;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    Regulate the design of coalbed methane wells and recovery techniques;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    Authorize coalbed methane well drilling units and pooling interests therein;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    Establish field rules; and
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    Provide a process to enable coalbed methane well operators and coalbed methane owners to proceed with the orderly development and production of coalbed methane pending the judicial resolution of issues relating to coalbed methane ownership.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the General Assembly expressly finds that establishing an orderly process to permit and produce coalbed methane shall in no way be construed to create an inference or presumption as to the ownership of coalbed methane in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or be construed to or be used or interpreted to apply to any well otherwise permitted, approved, or regulated under KRS Chapter 353, except for any wells that are to be permitted, converted to, or operated as coalbed methane wells.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth and in the public interest to:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    Safeguard, preserve, and protect coal seams for safe mining; facilitate the expeditious, safe evacuation of coalbed methane from the coalbeds of this state; and maintain the ability and right of coal operators at all times to vent coalbed methane from mine areas for the safe recovery of coal;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    Foster, encourage, and promote the commercial development of the Commonwealth’s coalbed methane by establishing procedures for issuing permits and forming drilling units for coalbed methane wells without adversely affecting the safety of mining or the mineability of coal seams;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    Safeguard, protect, and enforce the correlative rights of coalbed methane operators and coalbed methane owners in a pool of coalbed methane so that each operator and owner may obtain his or her just and equitable share of production from coalbed methane;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    Create a state permitting procedure and authority to provide for and facilitate coalbed methane development as encouraged by the Energy Policy Act of 1992; and
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    Seek the deletion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from the list of affected states by the Secretary of the United States Department of Interior as provided for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

    A coalbed methane well penetrating one (1) or more workable coalbeds shall be drilled in a manner that will exclude, if practicable, all coalbed methane or coalbed methane pressure from the workable coalbed, except as is found in the workable coalbed itself. Each string of casing that is run through a workable coalbed shall be seated at least thirty (30) feet below the workable coalbed in twenty (20) feet of cement, mud, clay, or other nonporous material that will make an effective seal. If a second workable coalbed is found less than thirty (30) feet below the first workable coalbed, the casing shall be seated and mudded off as above provided at least thirty (30) feet below the second workable coalbed. If gas is found between the two (2) workable coalbeds, it shall be treated as prescribed by this chapter. After any such string of casing has been properly seated, drilling may proceed immediately.

The largest sized casing to be used in the well shall be centrally placed within this liner. The liner may be welded to the casing to be used, and the space between the liner and the casing shall be filled with cement as the liner and casing are lowered into the hole. Cement shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to a depth of twenty (20) feet to form a sealed seat for both liner and casing. Following the setting of the liner, drilling may proceed. If it is necessary to drill through the horizon of two (2) or more workable coalbeds where the coal has been removed, the liner shall be started not less than twenty (20) feet below the lowest horizon penetrated and shall extend to a point not less than twenty (20) feet above the highest horizon penetrated.

     Well operators to execute bonds or blanket bonds in favor of department — Establishment of coalbed methane well plugging fund — Operators’ civil and criminal liability.

    </span>
    When any person submits to the department an application for a permit to drill a coalbed methane well, or to reopen, deepen, or temporarily abandon any coalbed methane well which is not covered by a surety bond, the department shall, except as provided in this section, require from the well operator a bond in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bonds shall be made in favor of the Department for Natural Resources, conditioned that the wells upon abandonment shall be plugged in accordance with the administrative regulations and that all records required by the department be filed as specified. All bonds shall remain in effect until the plugging of the well is approved by the department, or the bond is released by the department. Any well operator in lieu of the bond may file with the department a blanket bond in a sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), covering all coalbed methane wells drilled or to be drilled in the Commonwealth by the principal in the bond, and the acceptance and approval by the department of the blanket bond shall be in full compliance with the above provision requiring an individual well bond. The department may establish a bond in a sum greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for an individual well or blanket bond in sum greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) if the department determines that the particular circumstances of the drilling of the well or wells warrant an increase in the bond amount. A deposit in cash or a bank-issued irrevocable letter of credit may serve in lieu of either of the individual well or blanket bonds. A certificate of deposit, the principal of which is pledged in lieu of a bond and whose interest is payable to the party making the pledge, may also be accepted by the department. If an operator is required to post individual well bonds exceeding a total of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or elects to post a blanket bond, the certificate of deposit shall be accepted by the department in lieu of that portion of the amount of the bonds exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bond or bonds referred to in this section shall be executed by the well operator as principal and, if a surety bond, by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. A deposit in cash shall serve in lieu of either of the above bonds; all cash bonds accepted by the department shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account, with the interest thereon payable to the special agency account known as the coalbed methane well plugging fund, created in subsection (3) of this section, to be used in accordance with the purposes described therein.

    A successor to the well operator shall post bond, pay a twenty-five dollar ($25) fee per well to the department, and notify the department in writing in advance of commencing use or operations of a well or wells. The successor shall assume the obligations of this chapter as to a particular well or wells and relieve the original permittee of responsibility under this chapter with respect to the well or wells. It shall be the responsibility of the selling operator to require the successor operator to post bond before use or operation is commenced by the successor and relief of responsibility under this chapter is granted to the original permittee.

This fund shall be available to the department and shall be expended for the plugging of any abandoned coalbed methane wells coming within the authority of the department pursuant to this chapter. The plugging of any coalbed methane wells pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed to relieve the operator or any other person from civil or criminal liability which would exist except for the plugging. Any unencumbered and any unexpended balance of this fund remaining at the end of any fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward for the purpose of the fund until expended or until appropriated by subsequent legislative action.

    The General Assembly finds that the Commonwealth is the leading producer of coal and that the production of coal in Kentucky contributes significantly to the nation’s energy needs. The General Assembly further finds that unregulated surface coal mining operations cause soil erosion, damage from rolling stones and overburden, landslides, stream pollution, the accumulation of stagnant water and the seepage of contaminated water, increase the likelihood of floods, destroy the value of land for agricultural purposes, destroy aesthetic values, counteract efforts for the conservation of soil, water and other natural resources, destroy or impair the property rights of citizens, create fire hazards, and in general create hazards dangerous to life and property, so as to constitute an imminent and inordinate peril to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that lands that have been subjected to surface coal mining operations and have not been reclaimed and rehabilitated in accordance with modern standards constitute the aforementioned perils to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that there are wide variations in the circumstances and conditions surrounding and arising out of surface coal mining operations due primarily to difference in topographical and geological conditions, and by reason thereof it is necessary, in order to provide the most effective, beneficial and equitable solution to the problem, that a broad discretion be vested in the authority designated to administer and enforce the regulatory provisions enacted by the General Assembly. The General Assembly further finds that governmental responsibility for regulating surface coal mining operations rests with state government and hereby directs the Energy and Environment Cabinet to take all actions necessary to preserve and exercise the Commonwealth’s authority, to the exclusion of all other governmental entities except the Commonwealth and agencies thereof and except as provided in KRS Chapter 100. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to provide such regulation and control of surface coal mining operations as to minimize or prevent injurious effects on the people and resources of the Commonwealth. To that end, the cabinet is directed to rigidly enforce this chapter and to adopt whatever administrative regulations are found necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.

    The statutes which authorize the enactment of a regulation requiring payment of any penalties imposed by a hearing officer prior to a formal hearing — viz., KRS 224.033 (now 224.10-100), 350.020, 350.028, 350.255, 350.465 and 350.610 — do not mention nor do they authorize prepayment of penalties as a condition precedent to a formal hearing; therefore such regulation is null, void and unenforceable.

    Where a federal act and its regulations provide for a procedure by which an accused strip miner is provided a formal hearing, with a full record, rights of examination, cross-examination, subpoenas, etc., and where from this full hearing there is an appeal to an administrative law judge and ultimately to the federal court system, by not providing a similar proceeding, the parallel Kentucky regulations are more stringent than the federal law and regulations, in violation of KRS 13A.120(1), thus making 405 KAR 7:090(4), which provides for a formal hearing only upon prepayment, null, void and unenforceable.

    The remedy of bond forfeiture and the remedy of ordering a permittee to reclaim a site are not mutually exclusive; nothing in the statutes providing for forfeiture of bond if a reclamation violation is not abated, that authorize the cabinet to order that a permittee undertake certain abatement obligations or that authorize the cabinet to seek injunctive relief suggest that these remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive; on the contrary the cabinet’s ability to seek remedies of both bond forfeiture and injunctive relief afford it protection in those cases in which the amount of the bond is inadequate to pay for the cost of completing reclamation.

    Any person aggrieved by a final order of the cabinet resulting from a hearing on the issuance of a notice of noncompliance, the issuance of an order for cessation and immediate compliance, the assessment of civil penalties, or a bond forfeiture may obtain a review of the order by filing in the Franklin Circuit Court or the Circuit Court of the county within which the mine is located, within thirty (30) days after the entry of the order, a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part, provided that a surety on a performance bond shall not file such petition until it has complied with subsection (3) of this section. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith served upon the cabinet, and thereupon the cabinet shall certify and file in court a copy of the record before the cabinet, including therein all pleadings, orders, documentary exhibits and the stenographic transcript of the testimony taken before the cabinet. When these have been filed, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, enforce or set aside the order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the cabinet or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The findings of the cabinet as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearings before the cabinet, the court may order that additional evidence be taken before the cabinet in such manner and upon such condition as the court may consider proper. The cabinet may modify its findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so taken; and it shall file any modified or new findings with the court, which if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive, and any recommendation for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The commencement of the proceedings under this section does not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the cabinet’s order.

The amount shall continue to be held by the cabinet until completion of judicial review as authorized in subsection (2) of this section.

    In an appeal from a judgment dismissing a petition for review of a final order of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet for lack of venue, where petitioner sought partial release of a performance bond covering an interim surface mining permit, this section was held to deal more specifically with surface mining than KRS 224.085 (now 224.10-470) and, since it was more recent than KRS 224.085 (now 224.10-470), was held to control venue in the appeal.

    The provision of subsection (2) of this section that indicates the findings of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive is applicable only to contested proceedings where evidence is heard and findings of fact are made; it has no application whatever to a default situation, where under the regulations, the violations are deemed to be admitted and no evidence is required to prove them.

   <p class="p8">
    Defendants were cited by the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet for violations of certain strip-mining regulations but, despite proper notification, neither attended their scheduled hearings and, since on appeal to Circuit Court no objection to the cabinet’s order can be raised which was not previously urged to the cabinet, defendants are therefore deemed to have waived all rights to contest the fact of the violation or the proposed penalty.

    Because there was substantial evidence to support the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet’s order penalizing defendant for mining without a permit, the Circuit Court was without authority to make independent findings of fact.

    declaratory judgment proceedings brought by surface miner for a declaration
    of rights which raised issues that were pending in administrative proceedings
    before the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet on the date
    the declaratory judgment was filed, since the secretary and Cabinet are vested
    with the full power and authority to enforce the state’s surface mining and
    reclamation laws, while the courts are vested in such proceeding with only
    the authority to review final orders on appeal. White v. Shepherd, 940 S.W.2d 909, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

    that the statutes and regulations did not apply to them, they were not entitled
    to rely on the exception to the general rule which required them to exhaust
    their administrative remedies and trial court did not err by dismissing their
    action for failing to first exhaust their administrative remedies. White v. Shepherd, 940 S.W.2d 909, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

    Since sureties on performance bonds of corporation that had received permits to engage in surface mining could not be deemed to be in default until the date upon which they refused to honor their obligations as sureties after being called upon to do so, where no claims were asserted against sureties until 1993 when they were notified by letter that mining corporation had been cited for noncompliance and that state was entitled to undertake the required reclamation work and state filed action when the bond were not honored, since it is clear from the record that a cause of action was filed against surety within seven (7) years of its right to institute suit, such claims were not barred by limitations.

    Circuit Court properly affirmed a decision by the Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet to suspend rather than revoke a mining permit and an amended permit even though a hearing officer recommended that the permits be revoked based on a mining company’s failure to adequately address several statutory and regulatory requirements in its permit applications.

    Pursuant to KRS 304.36-080(1)(b), the Kentucky Insurance Guaranty Association (KIGA) becomes liable for reclamation performance bond where surface mining permittee fails to obtain adequate bond after surety’s insolvency. However, KRS 304.36-080(1)(b) limits KIGA’s obligation where the permittee violates applicable statutes and regulations other than the performance bond requirements. In most cases, KIGA will only become liable if a permittee fails to obtain a new performance bond and fails to properly reclaim the mining site. Kentucky Ins. Guar. Ass'n v.

The permit application containing the required plans and other information as required shall be submitted to the cabinet, and the cabinet shall notify the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, within sixty-five (65) cumulative working days after receipt of a complete application whether the permit application is acceptable. If applicable notice, hearing, and conference procedures prevent a decision from being issued within the sixty-five (65) cumulative working day period, the cabinet shall have additional reasonable time to issue its decision, not to exceed twenty (20) days from the completion of the notice, hearing, and conference procedures. If the permit application is not acceptable, the cabinet shall set forth the reasons for which the application or plans are not acceptable and it may propose modifications, delete areas, or reject the entire application. If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the cabinet, he or she may, by written notice, request a hearing conducted by the cabinet in the manner provided by KRS 350.0305. The cabinet shall notify the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, within twenty (20) days after the hearing of its decision.

That portion of the locations shall be described and designated on the map attached thereto. If the permittee or operator wishes to combine surface operations with underground mining operations to assure maximum practical recovery of coal resources, the cabinet may grant a variance, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the cabinet, for specific areas within the reclamation plan from the requirement that reclamation efforts proceed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section so as to permit underground mining operations prior to reclamation.

No part of the bond or deposit shall be released under this subsection as long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of requirements set by this chapter or until soil productivity for prime farm lands has returned to levels of yield equivalent to those of unmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from soil surveys that may be required to be included in the permit application. If a sedimentation pond is to be retained as a permanent impoundment, the portion of bond may be released under this subsection so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the permittee or the landowner have been made with the cabinet.

     Protection and location of pollinator habitats on coal mine reclamation sites.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    The General Assembly finds that the reclamation of coal mine sites can benefit from pollinator habitat sites. These sites are an important conservation resource which will encourage and protect the habitat for pollinators like honeybees, bumble bees, and other bee species. The protection and location of pollinator sites situated on mine sites can increase the revegetation rates during the reclamation period which supports soil and hydrologic stability. Therefore, the General Assembly hereby directs the cabinet to develop a plan in conjunction with the Division of Conservation to encourage coal licensees to locate and protect pollinator sites on reclamation sites and to use high-value trees and shrubs to aid in pollen transfer.

    Upon satisfaction of paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1) of this section and all other obligations provided for in this section, the entity responsible for the performance of reclamation shall be deemed by operation of law to have an “easement of necessity to conduct reclamation operations” for such property as was under the expired or terminated lease. The easement of necessity to conduct reclamation operations shall exist for a period of time that is reasonably necessary for the entity responsible for the reclamation to complete any reclamation operations required by the permit and by KRS Chapter 350, but in no case shall the easement of necessity to conduct reclamation operations exist longer than eight (8) years from the date the easement is created pursuant to this section.

     (a)

    Provide to the permitting agency, with a certified copy to the current surface owner, documentation to establish the satisfaction of the conditions imposed by this section and receive from the permitting agency a written determination that the permitted area for which the easement of necessity is requested falls within the conditions of this section; and

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     3.

    If no agreement is reached as to the amount of appropriate compensation within fifteen (15) days following receipt by the surface owner of the written offer of compensation from the entity responsible for reclamation and the appraisal report, the entity responsible for reclamation shall pay into an escrow account for the benefit of the current surface owner in a bank authorized to do business in the Commonwealth an amount equal to the written offer by the entity responsible for reclamation, which shall be not less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for the first three (3) years of the reclamation and liability period. The entity responsible for the reclamation shall provide the current owner with the location of the escrow account.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    After subsection (3)(b)3. of this section is satisfied, the entity responsible for reclamation shall have the immediate right of entry solely to perform reclamation as required by the permit and state law.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    If the surface owner believes the amount placed in escrow is insufficient compensation, the owner may bring an action in the Circuit Court in the county in which the property in question is located for a determination of the fair rental value of the property.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    Following the first payment, five thousand dollars ($5,000) or the appraised fair rental value, whichever is greater, shall be paid to the current surface owner for each year of reclamation and extended liability period until the final bond release and shall be paid on the first day of each subsequent year beginning with the fourth year.

    When any of the requirements of this chapter or administrative regulations adopted pursuant thereto or the orders of the cabinet have not been complied with, the cabinet shall forthwith cause a notice of noncompliance to be issued upon the permittee, person, or operator. The cabinet shall set forth in its notice a reasonable time period but not more than ninety (90) days for the abatement of the violation. If any permittee, person, or operator has not abated the violation within the time prescribed in the notice of noncompliance, the secretary or other authorized personnel of the cabinet shall issue to the permittee, operator, or person an order for immediate compliance and cessation of any mining activities or operations which are contributing to the violation. The order shall require the permittee, person, or operator to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible. The secretary is authorized to promulgate reasonable administrative regulations for the implementation of this section. The notice or order shall be handed to the person in charge of the operation and the operator or person engaged in coal exploration operations or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the permanent address shown on the application for a permit; or by electronic mail to the address shown on the permit application or otherwise voluntarily provided to the cabinet by the permittee on a form prepared by the cabinet; or, if no address is shown on the application, then by certified or electronic mail to the address known to the cabinet. The notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation shall specify in what respects the permittee, person, or operator has failed to comply with this chapter or the regulations or orders of the cabinet and the remedial action required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which the notice or order applies. If the permittee, person, or operator has not reached an agreement with the cabinet or has not complied with the requirements set forth in the notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation within time limits set therein, the permit may be revoked or the operation terminated, after an opportunity for a hearing, by order of the cabinet, and the performance bond, if any, shall then be forfeited to the cabinet, provided that failure to attend a hearing shall be excused for good cause shown. Any bonding company or financial institution providing bond to the cabinet shall have the right to perform those measures necessary to secure bond releases if the bonding company or financial institution can demonstrate that it has the ability to perform the measures and will undertake to do so within a reasonable time frame. The bonding company, or financial institution providing the bond, may, at any stage of the reclamation process, pay the remaining encumbered balance of the bond and thereby discharge its obligation under the bond. Neither the surety company nor the financial institution may employ anyone to perform the measures who has been barred from mining pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

The cabinet shall not issue any permits to or allow future operations by any permittee, operator, or person who has demonstrated a pattern of willful violations of this chapter of such nature and duration with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate an intent not to comply with the provisions of this chapter, provided that no permit shall be denied on this basis without an opportunity for a hearing. The secretary shall promulgate regulations which implement this section.

For purposes of this subsection, “imminent danger to the health and safety of the public” means the existence of any condition or practice, or any violation of a permit or other requirement of this chapter in a surface coal mining and reclamation operation, which condition, practice, or violation could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated.

    When a bond for an interim or preinterim program permit was forfeited prior to July 15, 1988, by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is not necessary to establish proper drainage and revegetation on the permit area for which it was submitted, the cabinet may use any remaining funds to supplement reclamation of other forfeited or released permit areas, if the other permit areas endanger public health and safety.

    When the bond for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation, the unused funds less any interest that has accrued shall be returned to the party from whom they were collected, subject to the cabinet’s right to attach or set off the proceeds under other state laws.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or the provisions of KRS Chapter 45A, when the bond, other than a surety bond or bond secured by a letter of credit, for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited and collected by the cabinet, and a person subsequently applies for a permit overlapping all or part of the disturbed area of the permit area for which the bond is forfeited, the cabinet may negotiate and enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped in exchange for all or part of the forfeited bond funds held by the cabinet, if requested by the applicant. If the applicant proposes to overlap only a part of the disturbed area the cabinet may enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the overlapped part of the disturbed area if the cabinet has retained a portion of the forfeited bond that is sufficient for the cabinet to reclaim the part of the disturbed area that is not overlapped. Any applicant under this subsection shall not be eligible for the benefits available under this subsection if the applicant has any ownership or control connection with the permittee or operator with respect to which the bond was forfeited. The amount of forfeited bond funds the cabinet may pay to the applicant shall be determined by the cabinet based upon the estimated cost for the cabinet to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped to the reclamation standards applicable to the original permit, but not to exceed the forfeited bond amount collected and held by the cabinet. Payments under this subsection shall be made only after release of the bond pursuant to KRS 350.093(4)(a) for those areas of the overlapping permit that are covered by the contract. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were disturbed under the forfeited interim permit may be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Areas where coal is not removed under the overlapping permit and the disturbances are for reclamation of the interim permit only shall be reclaimed to interim program standards. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were not disturbed under the forfeited interim permit shall not be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to exempt a person from the permitting, bonding, and reclamation requirements imposed in this chapter or to infringe upon the right of any surety to reclaim any permit or increment thereof to avoid bond forfeiture.

    There is hereby created an agency of the party States to be known as the “Interstate Mining Commission,” hereinafter called “the Commission.” The Commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each party State who shall be the Governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party State, each Governor shall have the assistance of an advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other public and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his State on the Commission. In any instance where a Governor is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the Commission, he shall designate an alternate, from among the members of the advisory body required by this paragraph, who shall represent him and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the Governor to the Commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.

    Where well water was contaminated due to mining activities, the mine’s owner and operator was required to provide the property owners with access to a clean water source even though the well water, without mine contamination, was already contaminated and unfit for most uses because the property owners could easily correct the pre-mining problems with cleaning and routine maintenance but, even with cleaning and maintenance, the sulfates from the mining operation would remain. Further, the requirement of KRS 350.421(2) to provide fresh water upon contaminating a water source did not require the replacement only of an uncontaminated water supply; although the well water was already unfit for drinking and other uses, it was undisputed that it was also contaminated from mining operations, and as such, the mine was liable for the provision of fresh, uncontaminated water.

    Strip mining regulation which denies the due process hearing to an aggrieved party based solely on his financial inability to pay the penalties which he seeks to appeal is unconstitutional, in violation of the equal protection clauses of both the United States and Kentucky constitutions.

    Where a federal act and its regulations provide for a procedure by which an accused strip miner is provided a formal hearing, with a full record, rights of examination, cross-examination, subpoenas, etc., and where from this full hearing there is an appeal to an administrative law judge and ultimately to the federal court system, by not providing a similar proceeding, the parallel Kentucky regulations are more stringent than the federal law and regulations, in violation of KRS 13A.120(1), thus making 405 KAR 7:090(4), which provides for a formal hearing only upon prepayment, null, void and unenforceable.

    Lands and water eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures under the Abandoned Mine Lands Program are those which were mined for coal or which were affected by coal mining, wastebanks, coal processing, or other coal mining processes, and were abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under the provisions of this chapter. Surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining shall not affect the eligibility of those lands for reclamation and restoration under this chapter after the release of the bond or deposit for a remining operation as provided under KRS 350.093. In the event the bond or deposit for a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining is forfeited, funds available under this chapter may be used if the amount of the bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement, except that if conditions warrant the cabinet shall immediately exercise its authority under KRS 350.585.

    Funds allocated to the Commonwealth through annual grants from the Secretary of the Interior may be expended for the purposes of protecting, repairing, replacing, constructing, or enhancing facilities relating to water supply, including water distribution facilities and treatment plants, to replace water supplies adversely affected by coal mining practices. If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this subsection occurred both prior to and after August 3, 1977, subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall not be construed to prohibit use of funds for the purposes of this subsection, if the adverse effects occurred predominantly prior to August 3, 1977.

The proceeds of any such sale shall be credited to the abandoned mine reclamation fund. The cabinet, when requested after appropriate public notice, shall hold a public hearing, with the appropriate notice, in the county or counties in which lands acquired pursuant to this section are located.

    The General Assembly finds that there has been a recent interest in the Commonwealth in the mining and processing of oil shale due to the critical need for fossil fuel which has developed in this country. The General Assembly further finds that the development of this fossil fuel could be of significant long-range benefit to the Commonwealth and to the United States of America, but that the unregulated extraction and processing of oil shale within the Commonwealth could cause soil erosion, water pollution, and the destruction of aesthetic and agricultural values. The General Assembly further finds that, in order to effectively regulate the extraction and processing of oil shale, the Energy and Environment Cabinet shall conduct extensive research concerning the process, waste production, and potentially adverse environmental impacts of such recovery operations.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

    It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide such regulation and control of the mining and processing of oil shale as to minimize and prevent its adverse effects on the citizens and the environment of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that the Energy and Environment Cabinet is the most competent agency to regulate the extraction and processing of oil shale due to its expertise in the handling of the surface mining of other minerals and in the regulation of other sources of air and water pollution.

    The Energy and Environment Cabinet shall file with the regulations compiler reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to oil shale mining operations, which shall include strip mining as defined by KRS 350.010, the surface effects of underground mining of oil shale, and the in situ mining of oil shale by June 30, 1981. No person shall engage in the commercial mining or processing of oil shale until such time as the cabinet promulgates rules and regulations to provide standards for such mining.

The secretary shall promulgate regulations consistent with existing standards for land, water, and air protection. The secretary may conduct a public hearing on the subject of the cabinet’s regulation of the extraction and processing of oil shale for the purpose of collecting data and receiving public comments on this issue.

Regs 24:030 § 8(3) was contrary to law, KRS 350.610, and more stringent than the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C.S. § 1201 et seq., thereby rendering it null, void and unenforceable; the Cabinet refused to make a finding of unsuitability yet imposed restrictive conditions consistent with an unsuitability determination.

    Any permittee, person, or operator who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto or who fails to perform the duties imposed by these provisions, except the refusal or failure to obtain a permit or other authorization as provided in this chapter, or who violates any determination or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be liable to a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the violation, and an additional civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day during which the violation continues, and in addition, may be enjoined from continuing the violations provided in this section. Any permittee, operator, or person who fails to abate a violation noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. Any person issued an order pursuant to KRS 350.130(4) shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation cited in the underlying notice of noncompliance issued therewith. No separate civil penalty shall be assessed for the order issued pursuant to KRS 350.130(4). Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment. The cabinet shall develop a method for calculating monetary penalties and shall promulgate it as an administrative regulation. The secretary or a designated representative, upon his or her own initiative or upon written request received within fifteen (15) days after the cabinet mails its proposed penalty assessment, may waive the use of the method for calculating monetary penalties if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case. If the secretary or his or her designated representative waives the use of the formula, he or she shall determine the appropriate penalty upon consideration of the permittee’s history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation, the seriousness of the violation, whether the permittee was negligent, and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. The penalties shall be recoverable in an action brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky by the cabinet. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto. All sums recovered shall be placed in the State Treasury, except those moneys collected in excess of eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000) in any fiscal year shall be deposited into the restricted fund account of the Office of the Commissioner of the Department for Natural Resources to be disbursed for the purposes set out in KRS Chapters 350, 351, and 352. All moneys previously deposited in the abandoned mine land enhancement fund shall be redeposited in the reclamation guaranty fund.

Each day shall constitute a separate violation. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any permittee, person, or operator who fails to abate a violation of KRS 350.060 or KRS 350.029 or KRS 350.057, as noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement, shall be assessed an additional civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. However, the penalties provided in subsection (1) of this section shall apply in lieu of the penalties provided in this subsection where an operator or permittee through inadvertence has exceeded the boundaries or expiration date of the permit in effect at that time.

The in-kind work shall not substitute for those remedial measures mandated by the cabinet for the correction of any violations. The estimated cost of the in-kind work shall be greater than the penalty assessment. The cabinet’s Division of Abandoned Mine Lands shall have the authority to approve proposed in-kind projects and to recommend projects to the cabinet, and shall determine whether the estimated cost of the in-kind work exceeds the penalty assessment. For the purposes of this subsection, the cost of the in-kind work shall include only those expenditures for actual on-site reclamation or rehabilitation work, including direct equipment, personnel, and material cost, but excluding administrative overhead or transportation costs. Failure to perform the in- kind work as agreed upon by the person or operator subject to the penalty assessment shall reinstate the liability of the person, permittee, or operator for the full amount of the assessed penalty. The cabinet may prepare and promulgate administrative regulations as are necessary to implement and administer the provisions of this subsection.

     4. Procedure.

   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    The language of subsection (9) of this section necessarily implies that the enforcement procedure provided for therein against the corporate officer “who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out such
    . . . . .
    failure or refusal” shall be in Franklin Circuit Court because liability is predicated on failure by the corporate permittee to comply with the secretary’s “final order.” Chronologically, such failure can only occur after the administrative procedure against the corporation has culminated in an order that has been disobeyed. Natural Resources & Environmental Protection Cabinet v. Williams, 768 S.W.2d 47, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Subsection (9) of this section formed the basis for corporate permittee’s liability, not a piercing of the corporate veil, and did not require the naming of an individual, if the person is not the permittee, in the administrative proceeding as a prerequisite to the imposition of personal liability, only that a final order had been issued pertinent thereto and that there was a failure or refusal to comply before the individual entity could be held responsible. Triple M Mining Co. v. Natural Resources & Envtl. Protection Cabinet, 906 S.W.2d 364, 1995 Ky. App. LEXIS 146 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).

   <p class="p8">
    A complaint by the Natural Resources Environmental Protection Cabinet, in a case against the president and sole shareholder of a mining corporation, that specified that the defendant’s individual liability was as sole shareholder and president pursuant to subsection (9) of this section, provided adequate notice of the statutory basis for her liability without further parroting or paraphrasing the language within the statute. Natural Resources & Environmental Protection Cabinet v. Williams, 768 S.W.2d 47, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Notices of noncompliance, cessation orders, notice of proposed assessments and a form upon which the company could request an administrative hearing sent by certified mail to the corporate permittee and in several instances signed for by permittee’s father and business associate provided sufficient notice of the administrative orders and opportunity for hearing required by law and due process.

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    The remedy of bond forfeiture and the remedy of ordering a permittee to reclaim a site are not mutually exclusive; nothing in the statutes providing for forfeiture of bond if a reclamation violation is not abated, that authorize the cabinet to order that a permittee undertake certain abatement obligations or that authorize the cabinet to seek injunctive relief suggest that these remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive; on the contrary the cabinet’s ability to seek remedies of both bond forfeiture and injunctive relief afford it protection in those cases in which the amount of the bond is inadequate to pay for the cost of completing reclamation.

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The appellant was individually liable under subsection (9) where he was the sole officer, director, and shareholder of a corporation, he had notice of unabated violations by the corporation and related orders of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet, and he took no steps to see that the corporation complied with the orders.

   <li class="p6">
    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares the following:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    The highest priority and concern of the Commonwealth must be the health and safety of the coal industry’s most valuable resource, the miner.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The continued prosperity of the coal industry is of primary importance to the state.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    A high priority must be given to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the mines in this state.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    An inordinate number of miners are killed or injured during the first few months of their experience in a mine and upon acquiring new work assignments in a mine.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    These injuries result in the loss of life and serious injury to miners and are an impediment to the future growth of the state’s coal industry.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    Mining is a technical occupation with various specialties requiring individualized training and education.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)
    </span>
    Injuries can be reduced through proper miner training, education, and certification.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (8)
    </span>
    Mine safety can be improved by the imposition and enforcement of sanctions against licensed premises and certified and noncertified personnel whose willful and repeated violations of mine safety laws place miners in imminent danger of serious injury or death.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (9)
    </span>
    Abuse of illicit substances and alcohol in the mining industry represents a serious threat to the health and safety of all miners. Substance and alcohol abuse adversely affect the health and safety of miners. Mine safety can be significantly improved by establishing as a condition of certification that miners remain drug and alcohol free.

    2006 Ky. Acts ch. 241, sec. 2, subsec.

Materials in the bill folder for House Bill 572 (which became

    No miner shall be required to operate any equipment or work in any condition which he reasonably believes to be unsafe.

The licensee, coal operation, or other person against whom the allegations are made shall be given not less than twenty (20) days’ written notice of the charges against him, together with the date, time, and place at which the charges shall be heard, and of his opportunity to be represented by counsel, produce evidence and witnesses on his behalf, and examine the evidence and documents that may be produced against him. The commission may also be represented by counsel and shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, but its order shall be based upon competent evidence.

    Thousands of Kentuckians enter underground mines each day to produce coal that is so vital to the economy of our nation and the well-being of its people.

    The underground coal mine is a hazardous environment that constantly requires the highest degree of safety consciousness on the part of every individual.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    Despite training and a variety of safety efforts, each year coal mines continue to take a heavy human toll: large numbers of miners are injured; many are left permanently disabled; and a lesser number pay the ultimate price—death.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    Many activities are performed by a variety of persons; therefore, each coal miner is expected to learn and perform a large number of tasks.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    Miners frequently become engaged in unfamiliar tasks when substituting for others or assisting a fellow worker.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)

    The American zeal for work and productivity very frequently causes the miner to give second priority to normal safety measures and precautions.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)
    </span>
    Studies have demonstrated that experienced persons observing and providing on-the-job counseling to individual miners regarding their work habits can bring about a significant reduction in underground mine accidents and fatalities.

The mine ventilation plan and any revisions to the mine ventilation plan approved by the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration shall be submitted to the director or his or her authorized representative and incorporated into the license. All mine ventilation plans shall be set forth in printed form. The mine ventilation plan shall require the air quality throughout the mine to contain at least nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) oxygen and not more than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of carbon dioxide, and the volume and velocity of the air current shall be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases and dust, smoke, and fumes. A copy of the mine ventilation plan and any revisions to that plan shall be available to the miners and their representatives.

    The ventilation of all underground coal mines shall be produced by means of mechanically operated fans located outside the mine in fireproof housing and offset at least fifteen (15) feet to one (1) side or above the opening, protected by explosion doors or weak walls and arranged so that ventilating current may be reversed if necessary. The fan shall be installed so as to prevent recirculation of mine air. The main fan shall be operated from a power circuit independent from the mine circuit. If inside auxiliary fans are required to ventilate working places the commissioner must first approve the installation.

    The licensee, superintendent, or foreman of every coal mine worked by shaft, slope, or drift shall provide and maintain for every mine two (2) separate and distinct escapeways, one (1) of which is vented by the intake air. However, if a mine was originally licensed prior to January 1, 1990, the commissioner may approve an alternate ventilation plan. Each active working section shall be ventilated by a separate split of intake air. In all mines the quantity of air passing through the last open crosscut between the intake and return in any pair or sets of entries shall be not less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. All working faces from which coal is being cut, mined, or loaded in a working section between the intake and return airway entries shall be ventilated with a minimum quantity of three thousand (3,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. The quantity of air reaching the last crosscut in pillar sections may be less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute if at least nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute is being delivered to the intake of the pillar line. The air current shall under any conditions have a sufficient volume and velocity to reduce and carry away smoke from blasting and any flammable or harmful gases.

    As working places advance, breakthroughs for air shall be made not more than ninety (90) feet apart, except that where longwall or modern systems of mining are used the commissioner or his authorized representative may approve a greater distance between breakthroughs or the method of ventilating such longwall or modern systems of mining. If any breakthroughs between intake and return airways are not required for the passage of air or the travel of equipment, they shall be closed with stoppings. All permanent stoppings shall be substantially built with suitable incombustible or fire resistant material subject to the approval of the mine inspector so as to keep the working places well ventilated. All brattice cloth and ventilation tubing shall be flame resistant. Doors on the main haulways shall be avoided where practicable, and overcasts, built of concrete or other suitable material and of ample strength, shall be adopted. Where doors are used they shall be built in a substantial manner, and shall be hung so as to close automatically when unobstructed.

    In a mine where methane can be found to an extent of one percent (1%) or more on the return of any one (1) split, the mine safety specialist, with the approval of the commissioner, may require the mine to be ventilated by the exhaust system, requiring the haulage roads and all feed wires to be located on the intake air and the electrical system to be so arranged that no wires carrying electrical current shall be on return air. A period of not more than ninety (90) days from date of notification shall be allowed to make the changes required.

    The ventilation plan shall require all fans utilized in the ventilation plan to be in continuous operation unless the fan must be turned off for repairs or maintenance, during which time all persons must be withdrawn from the mine. After the mine fan is restarted following the completion of repairs or maintenance, it must be in operation for a sufficient period to ensure air quality and the equalization of the mine atmosphere. Within fifteen (15) minutes after a fan has been unintentionally stopped, all miners must begin withdrawing from the mine. If the fan is restarted before the miners reach the surface, the miners shall remain at the point of their retreat, and the area inby shall be preshifted prior to the miners returning to the section.

    No person shall be placed in charge of electrical face equipment in any mine unless he is a qualified person capable of determining the safety of the roof, face, and ribs of the working places and detecting the presence of explosive gas. Operators of electrical face equipment shall undergo an examination to determine their fitness to detect explosive gas and shall have a minimum of forty-five (45) days of actual mining experience before they are permitted to have charge of electric face equipment. Safety committeemen, shotfirers, and others whose duty may require them to make inspections for gas shall undergo and pass an examination or possess a mine foreman’s certificate before using an approved multi-gas detection device underground. The examination shall be given by the mine inspector. Blank forms for the examination shall be furnished by the department. A copy shall be retained on file at the mine office and the original shall be sent to the department fully made out and signed by the applicant and approved by the mine inspector.

    In any underground mine before removing any coal or other material or driving any entry or passageway within three hundred (300) feet of any surveyed natural gas or petroleum well, or before extending the workings in any mine beneath any tract of land on which these wells are also drilled, or within three hundred (300) feet of any of these wells or under any tract of land in visible possession of a well operator, the operator shall forward simultaneously to the well operator and to the Department for Natural Resources, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by registered mail, a copy of the maps and plans required by law to be filed and kept up to date, showing on the copy of the map or plan its mine workings and projected mine workings beneath the tract of land and within three hundred (300) feet of its outer boundaries. The operator may then proceed with his mining operations in the manner indicated on the copy of the map or plan; but if the conduct of his mining operations nearer than three hundred (300) feet to any surveyed natural gas or petroleum well, whether completed or being drilled, or to any proposed well where a derrick is being constructed for drilling, or proposed well will endanger the use of drilling of the well, the well owner or operator affected may, within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the copy of the map by him and the department, file specific objections in writing to the mining operations within less than three hundred (300) feet of the well; and if the objection is filed, the department shall notify the operator of the character of the objections and fix a time and place for an informal hearing not more than ten (10) days from the end of the fifteen (15) day period. At the hearing, the operator and the well operator, in person or by a representative, shall consider the objections and agree upon the character and extent of operations to be conducted within less than three hundred (300) feet of the well to satisfy the objections raised and meet the approval of the department. And, if no agreement can be reached, the department, after an administrative hearing conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B, shall make a decision defining what coal, if any, is necessary to be left for the safe protection of the use and operation of the well. The decision shall be subject to appeal by either party as provided in KRS 351.040. The department shall keep a complete record of all the hearings.

    Operators of pre-1960 wells are not exempt from all provisions of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, but in fact are required to plug their wells under KRS 353.180 and exercise other responsibilities relative to their wells despite the fact that the wells were drilled prior to the effective date of the Act. The successor must post bond under KRS 353.590, even if the well in question was “grandfathered” or otherwise protected from compliance with permitting or spacing requirements relating to production which would be unlawful in a well drilled after 1960.

    It is clear that the legislature intended that the application be held without issuing a permit until the expiration of the five-day period to give the owner, operator or lessee of the coal-bearing stratum an opportunity to raise his objection before the drilling begins. OAG 65-118.

    There is necessarily implied authority in the statutes for the Department of Mines and Minerals to make objection on its own motion to a well location in applying its expertise for the safety of persons. However, the department, when acting pursuant to this section, must follow the time limitations therein provided both as to the five days for filing objection and as to the ten days for holding a hearing thereafter. Further, so long as the department, upon reasonable information and in good faith, takes the action provided for in this section, observing the time limitations, its officers could not be held liable for such action in a civil suit for damages. In the absence of such circumstances, the law makes the issuance of the permit mandatory. OAG 65-118.

If a person other than the operator claims an interest in the equipment of a well proposed for plugging, he shall provide documentation of that interest to the department within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of the notice of the department’s intent to plug a well. Prior to the department’s advertising of bids for the plugging of a well, the department shall release the well’s equipment to the person deemed to have an interest in that equipment and it shall be the duty of the interest holder to remove the equipment before the well is plugged. If documentation as to an asserted interest is not provided to the department in the manner described in this subsection or a person deemed to be an interest holder fails to remove the equipment before a well is plugged, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of the equipment in accordance with this subsection.

    Operators of pre-1960 wells are not exempt from all provisions of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, but in fact are required to plug their wells under this section and exercise other responsibilities relative to their wells despite the fact that the wells were drilled prior to the effective date of the Act. The successor must post bond under KRS 353.590, even if the well in question was “grandfathered” or otherwise protected from compliance with permitting or spacing requirements relating to production which would be unlawful in a well drilled after 1960.

    The General Assembly finds that governmental responsibility for regulating all aspects of oil and gas exploration, production, development, gathering, and transmission rests with state government. The department shall promulgate regulations relating thereto and take all actions necessary to assure efficient oil and gas operations and to protect the property, health, and safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth in a manner consistent with KRS Chapter 353, and to the exclusion of all other nonstate governmental entities except as provided in KRS Chapter 100. The department shall promulgate regulations relating to gathering lines within six (6) months after June 24, 2003. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the rights of local governmental units to regulate the use of streets, highways, and rights-of-way. The department shall report quarterly to the Legislative Research Commission beginning July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004. The report shall detail progress made in carrying out this section, and the efficacy of the regulatory programs implemented.

    It is not the responsibility of the Department of Mines and Minerals to assume the Herculean function of settling boundary disputes, particularly since any aggrieved party may bring an injunctive suit to enjoin the violation of this section and the proper resolution of a boundary dispute, in connection with the proper location of oil and gas wells, can only be undertaken by the courts, in the absence of private agreements. Accordingly, the procedure by which the Department examines the plat filed with the application and determines from the face of the plat whether or not the proposed well is located within the tolerances established by this section and issues a permit if the spacing and other requirements have been met is a proper and practical legal procedure which the courts would uphold.

    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    Upon the application of any operator in a deep well pool productive of oil or gas, or both, and other minerals which may be associated and produced therewith and after notice given by the commission to all persons reasonably known to own an interest in the oil or gas in the pool, and after a hearing conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B, the commission may enter a final order requiring the unit operation of a pool or of any portion or combinations thereof within a field. The unit operation shall be in connection with a program designed to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, or otherwise to prevent waste, or to increase the ultimate recovery of the unitized minerals by additional recovery methods. The final order shall provide for the unitization of separately-owned tracts and interests within the pool or pools, but only after finding that:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The order is reasonably necessary for the prevention of waste;

     (b)
    </span>
    The proposed plan of unitized operation will increase the ultimate recovery of oil or gas, or both, from the pool and will be economically feasible;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    The production of oil or gas, or both, from the unitized pool can be allocated in a manner to insure the recovery by all owners of their just and equitable share of the production; and
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    A contract incorporating the unitization agreement has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by the owners of at least seventy-five percent (75%) in interest in the pool as costs are shared under the terms of the order and by seventy-five percent (75%) in interest in the pool as production is to be allocated of the royalty in the unit area, and a contract incorporating the required arrangements for operations has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by the owners of at least seventy-five percent (75%) in interest in the pool as costs are shared, and the commission has made a finding to that effect either in the final order or a supplemental order.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    The final order requiring the unit operation shall designate one (1) operator as unit operator and shall also make provision for the proportionate allocation to all operators of the costs and expenses of the unit operation, including a reasonable charge for supervision, which allocation shall be in the proportion that the separately-owned tracts share in the production from the unit. In the absence of an agreement entered into by the operators and filed with the commission providing for sharing the costs of capital investments in wells and physical equipment, and intangible drilling costs, the commission shall provide by order for the sharing of the costs in the same proportion as the costs and expenses of the unit operation, but any operator who has not consented to the unitization shall not be required to contribute to the costs or expenses of the unit operation, or to the cost of capital investment in wells and physical equipment, and intangible drilling costs, except out of the proceeds from the sale of the production accruing to the interest of the operator exclusive of any royalty or overriding royalty interest.

    The commission, after notice and hearing as provided above may from time to time by entry of a new or amending final order enlarge the unit area by approving agreements adding to the area a pool or any portion or combinations thereof not previously included. Any new or amended final order shall not become effective unless and until:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)

   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    The extension or addition effected by the order has been agreed to in writing by the owners of at least seventy-five percent (75%) in interest in the pool as costs are shared in the pool or pools or portions or combinations thereof to be added to unit operations by the order and by seventy-five percent (75%) in interest in the pool as production is to be allocated of the royalty owners in the pool, pools, portions, or combinations and evidence thereof has been submitted to the commission.

    Any agreement, in providing for allocation of production from the unit area, shall first allocate to each pool or added portion a portion of the total production of oil and gas, or both, from all pools affected within the area, as enlarged, the allocation to be in proportion to the contribution which added pool or portions or extensions thereof are expected to make, during the remaining course of unit operations, to the total production of oil or gas, or both, of the unit as enlarged. The remaining portion of unit production shall be allocated among the separately-owned tracts within the previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified prior to the enlargement.

Summons shall issue upon the petition directing the cabinet to send its entire record, properly bound, to the clerk of the Circuit Court after certifying that the record is its entire original record or a true copy. The record, when filed, shall become official and be considered by the Circuit Court on the review. After the case has been properly docketed in the Circuit Court, any party directly affected by the issues on appeal, may, upon notice to the parties, proper showing, and in the discretion of the court, be permitted to intervene. The court shall review the entire record and the findings and final order of the cabinet. No objection to the final order shall be considered by the court, unless the issue was raised before the cabinet or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.
