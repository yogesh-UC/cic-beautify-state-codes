    It was not necessary that the agent reside at the place of business; nor that he be present at such place of business at all times. It was sufficient that he be at such place of business or in the county, at all reasonable times, and not be unnecessarily absent for unreasonable lengths of time. Paducah Cooperage Co. v. Commonwealth, 122 Ky. 755, 93 S.W. 12, 29 Ky. L. Rptr. 304, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 100 (Ky. 1906) (decided under prior law).

    A person designated by the statement as process agent remained such until a new statement was filed although he had ceased to be an agent in fact. American Patriots v.

    A penal action to recover a fine for violation of former section requiring registered office and agent must be brought in the county where the corporation conducts its business.

   <p class="p7">
    Where service was made on registered office and agent maintained as required by former similar section, the complaint could not be dismissed for lack of venue under KRS 452.450 since that section only refers to “an” office or place of business rather than the chief place of business.

    Home owners’
    fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation claims and a declaratory judgment claim against a construction company’s shareholders would not be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the shareholders could not be personally liable under KRS 271B.6-220(2) because the alleged misrepresentations were acts of the company, as the owners sufficiently alleged that the acts were the acts of the shareholders and not the company. Although the argument of the company and the shareholders might ultimately prevail, the court could only consider the facts as alleged in the complaint on a motion to dismiss. Schejbal v.

    Where the one owner continued to reach agreements with the construction company that was owed money by one owner’s administratively dissolved corporation, in the years after the money was owed, the one owner could not show that the one owner was not personally liable for the agreement the one owner made to guarantee the construction company payment in return for the construction company executing a lien waiver, which was an agreement the one owner did not fully perform. The one owner was not protected by KRS 271B.14-050 since the one owner’s conduct did not involve winding up the business and even though the one owner would normally be shielded from personal liability as a shareholder, the one owner was not so protected by KRS 271B.6-220(2) because the administratively dissolved corporation had been dissolved by the time the one owner entered into the agreement.

   <p class="p7">
    Husband and wife who owned and operated a Kentucky oil and gas drilling company were ordered to pay investors $5,662,662 in compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest because they committed fraud, breach of contract, and conversion when they made misrepresentations that induced an elderly investor, members of his family, and family trusts to invest in nonexistent and worthless gas wells, and the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523. The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS 271B.16-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

    District court erred when it found that a shareholder could not be personally liable for conversion where the proceeds of a sale of equipment that secured creditor’s loan were used to pay off another creditor because the proceeds were maintained in the corporation’s account. Under Kentucky law, if the shareholder was responsible for the transfer of funds to pay off the other creditor and was acting on behalf of the corporation, he could be personally liable for the tort of conversion.

    Shareholder’s appeal of the dismissal of his derivative action was dismissed because, during the pendency of the appeal, as the result of a merger, the shareholder’s stock in the corporation was cancelled; derivative actions required plaintiffs to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the stockholders, and continuous ownership of stock was required. Further, the right to continue any pending derivative lawsuits would have passed from the former stockholders to the surviving corporation. Bacigalupo v. Kohlhepp, 240 S.W.3d 155, 2007 Ky.

    Although KRS 271B.8-300(3), regarding director liability, was relevant to determine the standard of care which the bank’s directors were obligated to exercise, the bank was not entitled to use that statute offensively to support a separate cause of action against its auditors. Indeed, even the bank cited no authority for the proposition that it could do so. Peoples Bank of N. Ky., Inc. v. Crowe Chizek & Co. LLC, 277 S.W.3d 255, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 176 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

    Because there was no mandatory or persuasive authority from Kentucky courts classifying a breach of fiduciary duty as a personal injury, the court declined to construe it as such. Therefore, KRS 271B.8-300 and 271B.8-420 did not fall under the protection of the “jural rights” doctrine and had to be enforced. Gundaker/Jordan Am. Holdings, Inc. v. Clark, 2008 U.S. Dist.

   <p class="p7">
    Lower courts erred in concluding that
    KRS 271B.8-300 abrogated a corporation’s common law fiduciary duty claims against corporate directors where the statute applied to any action taken as a director and any failure to take any action as a director, and preparing for and participating in a competing venture did not constitute the type of internal corporate governance conduct addressed in § 271B.8-300.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 271B.8-300 does not abrogate common law fiduciary duty claims against directors in Kentucky but essentially codifies a standard of conduct and standard of liability for directors that is derived from business judgment rule principles. Baptist Physicians Lexington, Inc. v. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C., 436 S.W.3d 189, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 642 (Ky. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    If a director is acting on his own accord in anticipation of competing with the corporation which he still serves, that conduct implicates the director’s common law fiduciary duties, not KRS 271B.8-300. Baptist Physicians Lexington, Inc. v. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C., 436 S.W.3d 189, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 642 (Ky. 2013).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    KRS 271B.8-300 simply does not speak to all actions an individual takes while serving as a corporate director but only to those which he or she takes or fails to take while acting in a directorial role, i.e., actions or inactions regarding corporate governance and the affairs of the corporation. For claims alleging breach of a director’s fiduciary duties, especially the duty of loyalty, in the context of preparation for and participation in a competing enterprise, the common law principles elucidated in case law continue to apply. Baptist Physicians Lexington, Inc. v. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C., 436 S.W.3d 189, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 642 (Ky. 2013).

    Clinic properly asserted a breach of fiduciary claim because KRS 271B.8-300 did not supplant the common law breach of fiduciary duty. Notice was given of a general claim of breach of fiduciary duty, the facts giving rise to the claim, and the nature of the damages sought; moreover, a reference to KRS ch. 271B was not required due to the liberal policy relating to notice pleadings. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C. v. Cooper, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 245 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1000 (Ky. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2011).

    Kentucky General Assembly intends for KRS 271B.8-300 to apply in all circumstances where money damages are sought in a claim of breach of fiduciary duty against a corporate director; aside from this heightened burden of proof, KRS 271B.8-300(5) tracks the common law very closely. The Kentucky Legislature has merely meticulously set forth the claims and remedies available under common law, and the change in the burden of proof does not indicate an intent to abrogate the common-law claim entirely; rather, it merely increases the burden of proof. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C. v. Cooper, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 245 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1000 (Ky. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2011).

     Director conflict of interest.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    A conflict of interest transaction shall be a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction shall not be voidable by the corporation solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one (1) of the following is true:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; or
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    The transaction was fair to the corporation.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation shall have an indirect interest in a transaction if:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    Another entity in which he has a material financial interest or in which he is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>
    Another entity of which he is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    For purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction shall be considered authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction shall not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum shall be present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction shall not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (1)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    For purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction shall be considered authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection. Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (2)(a) of this section, may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The vote of those shares, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. A majority of the shares that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

    Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS 275.170; KRS 271B.8-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity.

    Statute, which concerned director conflicts of interest, provided no support for the corporation's argument that it was capable of filing suit on its own behalf; the statute merely delineates transactions that are voidable by the corporation, and nothing in the statute requires a corporation to directly exercise that right, or alters the manner in which a corporation decides to exercise and vindicate such a right, and nothing in the statute disqualifies any director, self-interested or otherwise, from voting against the corporation exercising such a right.

     Unpublished decision:
    </i>
    KRS 271B.8-310(a), which governed corporate directors’ conflicts of interest, did not apply to the case because defendant, a former corporate officer and controller, was not a director of plaintiff, his former company. In the absence of Kentucky statutory authority governing a corporate officer’s conflicts of interest, Kentucky common law—in the instant case, Aero Drapery of Ky. Inc. v. Engdahl, 507 S.W.2d 166, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 671 (Ky. 1974), and its progeny—governed; therefore, defendant’s argument that, pursuant to KRS 271B.8-310(1), the transactions between companies in which he had a secret interest and plaintiff needed only to be “fair” to waive his conflicts of interest was not well taken. Mazak Corp. v. King, 496 Fed. Appx. 507, 2012 FED App. 0935N, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 17945 (6th Cir. Ky. 2012).

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p7">
    In setting “fair value” pursuant to KRS 271B.13-010, the trial court erred in applying a 20 percent marketability discount, absent exceptional circumstances, which made it possible for majority shareholders to squeeze-out a minority shareholder at a price considerably less than the minority shareholder’s proportionate interest in the closely-held family corporation as a whole. Brooks v. Brooks Furniture Mfgrs, Inc., 325 S.W.3d 904, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 207 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010), overruled in part, Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    In appraising a dissenter’s shares pursuant to KRS 271B.13-300 following a cash-out merger, a marketability discount was inappropriate at the shareholder level in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3), and and use of the Delaware block appraisal method was not necessary. Net asset value could be considered on remand, and an entity-level discount would be permissible. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011)(Overruling to the extent inconsistent: Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 251 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982), overruled in part, Brooks v. Brooks Furniture Mfgrs, Inc., 325 S.W.3d 904, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 207 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Because a hypothetical market price for the dissenter’s particular shares as a commodity is not the value being sought in an appraisal proceeding under KRS 271B.13-300, market adjustments to arrive at such a price, such as discounts for lack of control or lack of marketability, are inappropriate in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3). The dissenting shareholder is entitled to the fair value of his or her shares as measured by the proportionate interest those shares represent in the value of the company as a going concern, a value determined in accord with generally accepted valuation concepts and techniques, as to which the Delaware block approach is not required. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011)(Overruling to the extent inconsistent: Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553, 1982 Ky.

    In appraising a dissenter’s shares pursuant to KRS 271B.13-300 following a cash-out merger, a marketability discount was inappropriate at the shareholder level in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3), and use of the Delaware block appraisal method was not necessary. Net asset value could be considered on remand, and an entity-level discount would be permissible. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky.

    Because a hypothetical market price for the dissenter’s particular shares as a commodity is not the value being sought in an appraisal proceeding under KRS 271B.13-300, market adjustments to arrive at such a price, such as discounts for lack of control or lack of marketability, are inappropriate in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3). The dissenting shareholder is entitled to the fair value of his or her shares as measured by the proportionate interest those shares represent in the value of the company as a going concern, a value determined in accord with generally accepted valuation concepts and techniques, as to which the Delaware block approach is not required.

    Where the one owner continued to reach agreements with the construction company that was owed money by one owner’s administratively dissolved corporation, in the years after the money was owed, the one owner could not show that the one owner was not personally liable for the agreement the one owner made to guarantee the construction company payment in return for the construction company executing a lien waiver, which was an agreement the one owner did not fully perform. The one owner was not protected by KRS 271B.14-050 since the one owner’s conduct did not involve winding up the business and even though the one owner would normally be shielded from personal liability as a shareholder, the one owner was not so protected by KRS 271B.6-220(2) because the administratively dissolved corporation had been dissolved by the time the one owner entered into the agreement.

    Husband and wife who owned and operated a Kentucky oil and gas drilling company were ordered to pay investors $5,662,662 in compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest because they committed fraud, breach of contract, and conversion when they made misrepresentations that induced an elderly investor, members of his family, and family trusts to invest in nonexistent and worthless gas wells, and the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523. The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS 271B.16-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

    A member of a constituent association to be affected by a merger or consolidation may give to the association prior to or at the meeting of its members to which the proposal of merger or consolidation is submitted to a vote, written notice that he objects to such proposal. Within twenty (20) days after the date on which the vote was taken, such member may, unless he votes in favor of the proposal, make written demand on the association for payment of the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interest in the association. Such demands shall state the number and class of shares of stock owned by him or the nature and amount of other property rights or interest owned by him in the association. In addition to any other right he may have in law or equity, a member giving such notice shall be entitled, if and when the merger or consolidation is effected, to be paid by the surviving association, or new association, the fair market value of such stock, or other property rights or interests, as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken, subject only to the surrender by him of the certificate, or certificates of such stock or other evidence of ownership or other property rights or interests.

    If, during the thirty (30) day period mentioned in the preceding subsection, the member and the surviving association or new association do not agree as to the fair market value of such stock or other property rights or interests, the member may, within sixty (60) days thereafter, file a petition in the Circuit Court of the county in which the surviving association or new association has its registered office or principal place of business asking for the appointment of three (3) disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interests. A summons, together with a copy of the petition, shall be served on the surviving association or new association at least twenty (20) days prior to a hearing on the petition by the court. The award of the appraisers, or a majority of them, if no exceptions be filed thereto within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, shall be confirmed by the court, and when confirmed shall be final and conclusive, and the member, upon depositing with the court the proper stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests, shall be entitled to judgment against the association for the appraised value thereof as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken. If either party files exceptions to the award of the appraisers within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, the case shall be transferred to the civil issue docket of the Circuit Court for trial and shall be there tried in the same manner, as near as may be practicable, as is provided for the trial of cases under the eminent domain law of this state, and with the same right of appeal to the Court of Appeals. The court shall assess the cost of the proceedings as it deems equitable. Upon payment of the judgment, the surviving association or new association is entitled to have the member’s stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests surrendered to it by the clerk of the court. Unless the member files such a petition within the time prescribed, he, his assigns and heirs claiming under him shall have no right to payment hereunder, but in that event nothing herein shall impair his status as a member.

    The affairs of the association shall be managed by a board of not less than five (5) directors, elected by the members from their own number. The bylaws may provide that the territory in which the association has members shall be divided into districts and that the directors shall be elected according to such districts, either directly or by district delegates elected by the members in that district. In such a case the bylaws shall specify the number of directors to be elected by each district, the manner and method of reapportioning the directors and of redistricting the territory covered by the association. The bylaws may provide that primary elections shall be held in each district to elect the directors apportioned to such districts and that the result of all such primary elections may be ratified by the next regular meeting of the association or may be considered final as to the association. The bylaws may provide that one or more directors may be appointed by any public official or commission or by the other directors selected by the members or their delegates. Such directors shall represent primarily the interest of the general public in such associations. The director or directors so appointed need not be members of the association, but shall have the same powers and rights as other directors.

    On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by a judgment creditor of a member or a member’s assignee, a court may charge the judgment debtor’s financial rights in the association with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of a transferee and shall have no right to participate in the management or to cause the dissolution of the association. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the financial rights and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the case may require to give effect to the charging order.

Poynter v. Phelps, 129 Ky. 381, 111 S.W. 699, 33 Ky. L. Rptr. 887, 1908 Ky. LEXIS 167 (Ky. 1908); Cox v. Prewitt, 197 Ky. 716, 247 S.W. 976, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 711 (Ky. 1923); Bogard v.

    Attempted judgment of ecclesiastical presbytery of Baptist association ousting minister and his followers from use of church property and declaring opposing faction entitled to property was void, where association had no authority by its constitution to adjudge matters relating to internal affairs of churches in its membership.

   <p class="p7">
    A church having the congregational form of government, in the sense that it does not recognize an ecclesiastical authority above the local church, an adherence to the belief that the members have a right to vote in church affairs cannot be considered a departure from fundamental doctrine within the meaning of the rule that a majority will forfeit its property rights by departing from the fundamental doctrines of the church.

    “Immorality” is such conduct as contravenes the moral or divine law; that amounts to dishonesty, wickedness or injustice; not a mere refusal by a minority to obey the majority or subscribe to its beliefs in all details.

   <p class="p7">
    Although the courts have no power to review excommunications, nevertheless they may determine whether the act was that of the church or of persons who were not the church, and in a church of the congregational type, a majority adhering to the organization and doctrines of the church represent the church, and cannot be expelled by a minority of those present.

    A county public hospital corporation which is formed as a nonprofit, nonstock corporation pursuant to KRS Chapter 273 is not a public agency which is subject to the Open Meeting Law ( KRS 61.805 — 61.850). OAG 82-1.
   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Since a county public hospital corporation being a corporation is not a public agency subject to the provisions of the statutes pertaining to conflict of interest, there is no statutory conflict of interest created by the employment of a law firm to represent the corporation in litigation while one of the members of the corporation’s board of commissioners is also a member of such law firm; such commissioner, however, should abstain from voting and absent himself from any meeting of the commission wherein the employment of his law firm is discussed or acted upon.

   </p>
   <p class="p7">
    Private, nonprofit, nonstock corporations are not public agencies and are therefore not subject to the Open Meetings law; thus, a nonprofit, nonstock corporation formed under KRS Ch. 273 for the purpose of local approval of loans for small businesses is not subject to the Open Meetings law.

    A Community Action Corporation is not a district for purposes of KRS 65.164 to 65.176 as it is not among the boards, commissions or special districts created pursuant to the statutory provisions set forth in KRS 65.164. OAG 82-196.

    A Community Action Corporation is not a special district for purposes of KRS 65.160 and 65.162 which permits two or more counties to join together to form a special district to fulfill any purpose which any individual county is authorized to fulfill. OAG 82-196.

    A Community Action Corporation organized and functioning pursuant to the terms and provisions of KRS 273.410 to 273.453 is a “district” for purposes of KRS 65.060 to 65.070 and can be a “special district” as defined in KRS 65.005 since the definition includes an “agency,” if that Community Action Corporation has been designated as an agency of a city or county government under KRS 273.435 or an agent of the Commonwealth under KRS 273.440 (now repealed). OAG 82-196.

   <p class="p7">
    Assuming that the Kentucky River Foothills Development Council is a Community Action Corporation organized and functioning pursuant to KRS 273.410 to 273.453, and that it has been designated, pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of the fiscal court, as an agent of the county under KRS 273.435 for the implementation of various statutorily authorized public welfare projects, the fiscal court may appropriate public funds to such a Community Action Corporation in connection with the carrying out of such projects. OAG 82-238.

   <p class="p7">
    If the fiscal court has designated a community action agency, pursuant to KRS 273.435, subject to available county funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS Chapter 68, the fiscal court can contribute to any of the authorized programs covered in subsection (2) of this section and KRS 273.441. The Senior Citizens meal program would be authorized under the statutory concept of reducing poverty and bettering living conditions. OAG 85-99.

    Pursuant to KRS 273.441 and subsection (2) of this section, any of the counties which have in legal effect designated a corporation as a community action agency may, subject to available funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS Chapter 68, contribute, through the corporation, county funds for any of the purposes described specifically in KRS 273.441 and subsection (2) of this section, with the assumption that such county grants are made by way of an agreement between the county and the corporation that such county money will be spent for a designated purpose or purposes, the corporation subsequently reporting to the county government the precise nature and amount of the final expenditure. While Ky. Const., § 179 prohibits any county from appropriating money for any corporation, except for roads or bridges, this is no violation of § 179 as relates to county money expended under the community action agency legislation. For a county may select a nonprofit corporation as an instrumentality in carrying out a public purpose. OAG 85-117.

    No across-the-board statement may be made as to whether all community action agencies in Kentucky are “units of local, municipal, county, or State government.” Rather, the circumstances, such as the relationship between the community action agency and the local government and the activity under review, must be considered as to each community action agency in question.

    A local county board of education would be sufficiently representative of the geographic area that it serves to qualify as an agency with which a community action agency could contract, and therefore, as long as the subject matter of the contract related to the purpose of promoting public education, a county board of education, on its part, could enter into a contract with a community action agency pursuant to KRS 160.160 and KRS 160.290.

    If the fiscal court has designated a community action agency, pursuant to KRS 273.435, subject to available county funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS Chapter 68, the fiscal court can contribute to any of the authorized programs covered in KRS 273.410(2) and this section. The senior citizens meal program would be authorized under the statutory concept of reducing poverty and bettering living conditions. OAG 85-99.

   <p class="p7">
    Pursuant to this section and KRS 273.410(2), any of the counties which have in legal effect designated a corporation as a community action agency may, subject to available funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS Chapter 68, contribute, through the corporation, county funds for any of the purposes described specifically in this section and KRS 273.410(2), with the assumption that such county grants are made by way of an agreement between the county and the corporation that such county money will be spent for a designated purpose or purposes, as expressly provided in this section and KRS 273.410(2), the corporation subsequently reporting to the county government the precise nature and amount of the final expenditure. While Ky. Const., § 179 prohibits any county from appropriating money for any corporation, except for roads or bridges, this is no violation of § 179 as relates to county money expended under the community action agency legislation. For a county may select a nonprofit corporation as an instrumentality in carrying out a public purpose. OAG 85-117.

    The state is responsible for administering the Federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Subtitle B — Community Services Block Grant (P.L. 97-35) and the state may not expend more than five percent (5%) of its allotment for administrative expense. Performing auditing functions is part of the state’s overall administrative responsibility and is thus an administrative expense; as an administrative expense, the cost of auditing should not be listed as a separate budget item beyond the state’s five percent (5%) allotment for administrative expenses.

    (6/24/2015). During codification of 2015 Ky. Acts ch. 34, Sec. 29 (this statute), the Reviser of Statutes has changed the word “corporation” to “association.” KRS Chapter 273A, dealing with unincorporated nonprofit associations, was created in that Act, and Section 29 of that Act was created as a new section of the new chapter. It is clear from the context that the reference to “corporation” in Section 29 of that Act was intended to be “association.” The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).

If such an article, bylaw or agreement is adopted or provided for and such stock is not redeemed by the corporation within said one (1) year period, then within ten (10) days following the end of said period the president and/or secretary of the corporation shall give notice thereof to the Secretary of State of Kentucky and, upon receipt of such notice by the Secretary of State, the charter of the corporation shall be immediately void.

Should a redemption not occur within the time limit provided herein, the shares shall immediately be cancelled on the books of the corporation and the holder of such shares shall be reimbursed as provided in subsection (4) of this section as a general creditor of the corporation.

The appraiser shall have the powers conferred upon master commissioners by KRS 31A.010 and shall afford a reasonable opportunity to the corporation and the shareholder or personal representative of a deceased shareholder to introduce pertinent evidence on such fair market value. The appraiser shall conduct his hearings as expeditiously as practicable, and upon completion of the hearing shall report in writing to the court his determination of the fair market pre-cancellation value of such shares and shall file with the court a written transcript of the testimony heard by him, together with all exhibits introduced in evidence.

After hearing the exceptions to the appraiser’s report, or if no exceptions thereto have been filed within the time hereinbefore provided for, the court shall enter final judgment determining such fair market, pre-cancellation value of the shares of each withdrawing shareholder and shall direct payment thereof by the corporation to each withdrawing shareholder and the surrender of the duly indorsed certificate or certificates representing his shares. The court shall be empowered to direct payment by the corporation in installments reasonably calculated to avoid any impending corporate insolvency while reimbursing the withdrawing shareholder in as direct a manner as may be practicable.

    It shall be the policy of the General Assembly through this chapter to give maximum effect to the principles of freedom of contract and the enforceability of operating agreements. Unless displaced by particular provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity shall supplement this chapter. Although this chapter is in derogation of common law, the rules of construction that require strict construction of statutes which are in derogation of common law shall not apply to its provisions. This chapter shall not be construed to impair the obligations of any contract existing when this chapter, or any amendment of it, becomes effective, nor to affect any action or proceeding begun or right accrued before the chapter or amendment takes effect.

    A written operating agreement may provide that the limited liability company interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that the member is obligated to make or who otherwise violates an obligation undertaken in the operating agreement shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)

     (f)

    Member created the limited liability company (LLC) and it appeared it was conducting the trucking business at issue, and by law, the only appropriate plaintiff to assert the lost business damages claim was the LLC; if the trial court was to find that the LLC was conducting the business on the date in question, defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the member personally had no standing to bring the business loss claim in his own name.

    Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS 275.170; KRS 271B.8-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity, and the Court of Appeals of Kentucky adopted the doctrine of corporate opportunity.

    Absent the unequivocal assumption of personal liability set forth in KRS 275.150(2), a capital call provision in the operating agreement of a limited liability company (LLC) was not a post-judgment collection device by which any legitimate business debt of the LLC could be transferred to individual members by a court-ordered capital call. Since the individual members of the LLC had not agreed in writing to assume personal liability, the shield of limited liability had not been lifted. Racing Inv. Fund 2000, LLC v.

    Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS 275.170; KRS 271B.8-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity.

    When awarding damages for a former limited liability company (LLC) member's breach of loyalty in diverting a business opportunity, it was error to deduct sums the former member paid to complete the opportunity because (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 275.170 required the former member's complete disgorgement of any profits, (2) the deduction let the member keep most funds the member's misconduct generated, which the member had to hold in trust for the LLC, and (3) the member's total benefit from the diverted opportunity was not found.

    Per the language of Ky. Rev. Stat.

    Simply acquiring economic rights does not, in and of itself, equate to “ownership” or “membership” in a limited liability company. Therefore, there was a failure of consideration for an agreement to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company because a seller did not have such an interest since he was not a member of the company under KRS 275.275; at most, the seller had an interest that he received in exchange for tendering $75,000 to the company.

    Simply acquiring economic rights does not, in and of itself, equate to “ownership” or “membership” in a limited liability company. Therefore, there was a failure of consideration for an agreement to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company because a seller did not have such an interest since he was not a member of the company under KRS 275.275; at most, the seller had an interest that he received in exchange for tendering $75,000 to the company.

    This section provides the exclusive remedy by which the judgment creditor of a member or the assignee of a member may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor’s limited liability company interest.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by a judgment creditor of a member or a member’s assignee, a court may charge the judgment debtor’s interest in the limited liability company with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee and shall have no right to participate in the management or to cause the dissolution of the limited liability company. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the limited liability company interest and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the case may require to give effect to the charging order.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    A charging order constitutes a lien on and the right to receive distributions made with respect to the judgment debtor’s limited liability company interest. A charging order does not of itself constitute an assignment of the limited liability company interest.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    The court may order a foreclosure upon the limited liability company interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser of the limited liability company interest at the foreclosure sale has the rights of an assignee. At any time before foreclosure, the charged limited liability company interest may be redeemed:
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    By the judgment debtor;
   </li>

    </span>
    With property other than limited liability company property, by one (1) or more of the other members; and

   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">

    With limited liability company property, by the limited liability company with the consent of all members whose interest are not so charged.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    This section does not deprive a member or a member’s assignee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member’s or assignee’s limited liability company interest.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (6)
    </span>
    The limited liability company is not a necessary party to an application for a charging order. Service of the charging order on a limited liability company may be made by the court granting the charging order or as the court should otherwise direct.
   </li>
   <li class="p9">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (7)

    This section does not apply to the enforcement of a judgment by a limited liability company against a member of that company.

    (7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together.

    (6/29/2017). Subsection (5) of this statute concerning when a derivative action involving a limited liability company cannot be maintained was amended in
    2017 Ky. Acts ch. 188, sec. 2. New language added to subsection (5)(a) of this statute read, in part, “represent the interests of the shareholder in enforcing the rights.” In codification, the Reviser of Statutes corrected a manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1)(h) by changing the word “shareholder” to “members” since limited liability companies do not have shareholders, but rather members, to be consistent with actual practice and language used in Sections 20 and 23 of that Act.
