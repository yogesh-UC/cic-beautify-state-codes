    (6/25/2013). In subsection (24) of this statute, the list of KRS sections has been corrected. During the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the amendments to the Model State Code of Military Justice appeared in House Bill 362 and House Bill 167. The section numbers in these bills changed several times when alternative versions of the bills were introduced, but some of the internal references in subsection (24) of this statute ( 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 32, sec. 6) were inadvertently not corrected to correspond to those changes. Under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has corrected those references to match the list that appears in Article 1(a)(14) of the Model State Code of Military Justice.

    Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists between an offense, either military or non-military, and the state military force. Courts-martial have primary jurisdiction of military offenses of this code. A proper civilian court has primary jurisdiction of a non-military offense when an act or omission violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.

    (6/25/2013). An internal reference has been changed in subsection (2)(c)1. of this statute. In the enacted version (2013 Ky.

However, it is clear from examining earlier versions of this legislation drafted during the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly, and from a reading of Article 38 of the Uniform State Code of Military Justice, that a reference to Section 28 (KRS 35.130) was intended.

Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

    (7/15/2016). 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 75, sec. 6 provided that a new section of KRS Chapter 35 was created to be numbered as KRS 35.680. However, a statute had previously been numbered as KRS 35.680 when it was created in 1970 and then
    renumbered as KRS 35.730 in 2013. Since the designation of “35.680” had been applied to an earlier statute and should not be assigned to a different statute because it would create confusion, the Reviser of Statutes has numbered 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 75, sec. 6 (this statute) as KRS 35.679 instead under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a).

    The Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes the need to provide for honorable burials for Kentuckians who have served their state and nation in the Armed Forces. Historically these burial services have been conducted by the active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, the military reserves, and the veterans’ service organizations.

     Rationale and purpose of program — Division of Emergency Management.
    </span>
   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    The General Assembly recognizes that the rationale and purpose of the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth has evolved from a program for response to threats to national security, enemy attack, and other national defense needs, to a program for response to all hazards, but primarily, domestic hazards and threats including natural, man-made, technological, industrial, or environmental emergencies or disasters, for which civil government is primarily responsible. Because of major changes in the rationale and necessity for emergency management capabilities, as well as the urgent requirement for multiagency participation and inter-agency coordination to ensure timely, effective, and appropriate disaster and emergency response in the Commonwealth, and to otherwise modernize and improve the administration, effectiveness, and relevance of the comprehensive emergency management program for the contemporary needs of the citizens of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly declares:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    A Division of Emergency Management is hereby created as the emergency management agency of state government which shall develop the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth on behalf of the Governor, and in consultation with the cabinet secretaries of state government, other appropriate state agency heads, local elected chief executives, local emergency management directors, and local emergency planning committees, for the purpose of developing and enhancing comprehensive emergency management program policies, plans, or procedures to provide for a coordinated responsive, and integrated emergency management system in the Commonwealth;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

    The division may accept on behalf of the Commonwealth any grant, contribution, or fund, federal or otherwise, made to assist in meeting the costs of carrying out the provisions and purposes of KRS Chapters 39A to 39F, and fully comply with all funding requirements imposed by the receipt and use of the grant, contribution, or fund; and

     Article I. Purpose and Authorities.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     Article II. General Implementation.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     Article III. Party State Responsibilities.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     A.
    </span>
    It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     1.
    </span>
    Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     2.
    </span>
    Review party states’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     3.
    </span>
    Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     4.
    </span>
    Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     5.
    </span>
    Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material;

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     6.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     7.

    Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     B.
    </span>
    The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contracting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     1.
    </span>
    A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

     Article IV. Limitations.

   <li class="p6">
    Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.

    Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any party state to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving state party, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     Article VI. Liability
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.

     Article VII. Supplementary Agreements.

   <li class="p6">
    Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.

     Article VIII. Compensation.

    Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     Article IX. Reimbursement.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article.

    Veterans’ bonus legislation does not violate the federal Constitution or the Kentucky Constitution since the status of the veteran is not that of a soldier in the United States army but that of a Kentucky citizen whom the legislature and the people deem proper to recognize because of his past service, and the bonus is reimbursement to such Kentuckians for losses suffered by reason of military service and has nothing whatever to do with raising or supporting armies.

    The votes of veteran members of the legislature on a veterans’ bonus were not void since the legislation presented involved a broad classification of a substantial segment of the public and although veterans in the legislature might anticipate that someday they would benefit from the legislation, such benefits were not private or personal, but were benefits to be received as members of a class.

    It was the intention of the legislature that all beneficiaries entitled to a bonus should receive their share thereof, but where the veterans’ division makes a determination as to the validity of a claim, though later found to be erroneous, and makes a conscientious though unsuccessful effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of a bonus, no additional funds can be paid out to other qualified beneficiaries.

    The Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes the vast majority of honorable burials for Kentuckians who have served their state and nation in the Armed Forces are conducted by the veterans’ service organizations. The active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, and the military reserves are providing burial honors details as available manpower permits. Year 2000 data from the Department of Defense shows over 497,000 veterans died, but only 91,074 military funeral honors were performed. Although the veterans’ service organizations provide untold thousands of unofficial services, many Kentucky veterans are still being buried without honors, including firing details, color guard, and pallbearers.
