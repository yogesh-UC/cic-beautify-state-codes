    Where the trustees of the policemen’s and firemen’s pension fund of a city of the fourth class sought to turn over all of the assets of the pension fund to an insurance company to invest and administer pursuant to the pension fund act in the place of the board, it was doubtful that such a procedure would be legal under the provisions of KRS 95.768 et seq., but investment of pension fund money in interest-producing stock of insurance companies would most likely be permissible. OAG 71-154.

    The circuit judges could authorize the Circuit Court clerk to invest funds from advance filing fees collected pursuant to KRS 64.030 (repealed) in one of the obligations permitted in this chapter, provided that sufficient amounts of the principal are available to apply to the clerk’s costs and give refunds to a party where applicable.

    Although the literal provision in KRS 41.380(2) (now KRS 42.500), that the State Investment Commission may invest state surplus funds in federal obligations, remains unchanged from the original enactment in 1952 the General Assembly amended this section in 1980 to expressly provide that any fiduciary holding funds for loan or investment may invest them in Certificates of Deposit of any state or national bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and, as the later statute, this section controls. OAG 81-353.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    KRS 41.220, 41.380 (now KRS 42.500), 386.010 and this section should be read together, i.e., in pari materia, since they concern the same subject matter. OAG 81-353.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The State Investment Commission, in carrying out its investment function under KRS 41.380 (now KRS 42.500), is a fiduciary of the state government. OAG 81-353.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The State Investment Commission has the authority under KRS 41.380(2) (now KRS 42.500) and subdivision (1)(l) of this section to invest “excess cash” in term repurchase agreements involving United States Treasury Bills since such agreements, in reality, involve the state’s purchase of United States Treasury Bills from a financial institution with an agreement that the financial institution will repurchase the treasury bills at some definite future date, not to exceed one year from date of investment. OAG 82-29.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Since proposed “reverse repurchase agreements,” by which the state would sell an investment that it held (such as treasury bills) for a specified number of days with the condition that the state repurchase the security at the end of that time, contemplated the use of “excess” funds (in excess of that amount required to meet current state expenditures under normal payment schedules) within the time limits of KRS 41.380(2) (now subsection (2) of KRS 42.500), such agreements would be valid and permissible on the part of the State Investment Commission. OAG 82-209.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The authority to engage in “reverse repurchase agreements” is implicit in the express power of investment. OAG 82-209.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The obvious purpose of KRS 41.380 (now KRS 42.500) and this section is to derive the maximum possible under marketing conditions from the investment of the state money. OAG 82-209.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Though the term “reverse repurchase agreement” is not found in that terminology in the statutes, the language of KRS 41.380 (now KRS 42.500) and subsection (1)(l) of this section is broad enough to cover this temporary sale of the securities, since the temporary sale does not negate the basic “investment” posture of the State Investment Commission in holding the securities involved in this procedure. OAG 82-209.

   <p class="p8">
    A bank acting in its capacity as a trustee may invest the trust assets under management in a mutual fund registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so long as such investments are not prohibited by the trust instrument or court order and the investments would be regarded by a prudent businessman as a safe investment. OAG 84-227.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)

    “Second trust” means a trust established under an irrevocable trust instrument, the current beneficiaries of which are one (1) or more of the current beneficiaries of the original trust. The second trust may be a trust created under the same trust instrument as the original trust or under a different trust instrument or the original trust whose terms have been modified under this section.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    A trustee of an original trust may, without authorization by the court, exercise the discretionary power to distribute principal or income to or for the benefit of one (1) or more current beneficiaries of the original trust by appointing all or part of the principal or income of the original trust subject to the power in favor of the trustee of a second trust or by modifying the terms of the original trust. The trustee of the original trust may exercise this power whether or not there is a current need to distribute principal or income under any standard provided in the terms of the original trust. The trustee’s special power to appoint trust principal or income in further trust under this section includes the power to create the second trust.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)

    A beneficiary who has only a future beneficial interest, vested or contingent, in the original trust cannot have the future beneficial interest accelerated to a present interest in the second trust;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (c)
    </span>
    The terms of the second trust may not reduce any fixed income, annuity, or unitrust interest of a beneficiary in the assets of the original trust, including an interest which is to take effect in the future;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (d)
    </span>
    If any contribution to the original trust qualified for a marital or charitable deduction for federal income, gift, or estate tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code, then the second trust shall not contain any provision that, if included in the original trust, would have prevented the original trust from qualifying for the deduction or that would have reduced the amount of the deduction;
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (e)
    </span>
    If contributions to the original trust have been excluded from the gift tax by the application of Sections 2503(b) and 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, then the second trust shall provide that the beneficiary’s remainder interest in the contributions shall vest and become distributable no later than the date upon which the interest would have vested and become distributable under the terms of the original trust;

    <span class="boldspan">
     a.

     (g)

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

    If the power to distribute principal or income in the original trust is subject to an ascertainable standard, then the power to distribute income or principal in the second trust shall be subject to the same or a more restrictive ascertainable standard as in the original trust when the trustee exercising the power described in subsection (2) of this section is a possible beneficiary under the standard; and

The power of appointment conferred upon a beneficiary shall be subject to KRS 381.224, 381.225, and 381.226 covering the time at which the permissible period of the rule against perpetuities and suspension of power of alienation begins and the law that determines the permissible period of the rule against perpetuities and suspension of power of alienation of the original trust.

    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    Plain language of the repeal of KRS 386.180 indicates that the Kentucky Legislature intended to remove any form of statutorily imposed guidelines regulating the fee habits of trustees of testamentary trusts, otherwise, the Legislature would have drafted and enacted a new law establishing how the fees should be calculated; therefore, in the absence of a statute directing otherwise, a court can only conclude that trustees of testamentary trusts are entitled to collect a “reasonable fee” commensurate with the performance of their duties. As a result, summary judgment was properly granted to several trustees in a compensation dispute where beneficiaries argued that the ceilings expressed in KRS 386.180 at the time the trusts were created remained in effect. Jarvis v. Nat'l City, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 20 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2011) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Holding in a declaratory judgment action that the trustees were not bound by the constraints of former KRS 386.180 was appropriate because the repeal was unlimited and trustees of testamentary trusts could collect reasonable fees on trusts that predate the repeal of KRS 386.180. Jarvis v. Nat'l City, 410 S.W.3d 148, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 394 (Ky. 2013) (decided under prior law).

    That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the fiduciary did not have the power to make the adjustment;

If paragraph (c)5., 6., 7., or 8. of this subsection restricts all fiduciaries from possessing or exercising a power under this section, the fiduciary may petition the District Court for the court to effect the intended conversion or action.

    A fiduciary may release the entire power conferred by this subsection or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the fiduciary is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in paragraph (c)1. to 6. of this subsection or if the fiduciary determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust or estate of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in paragraph (c) of this subsection. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.

    A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subsection (2) of this section, or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.

The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent’s death or an income interest’s terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

    Each beneficiary described in KRS 386.456(4) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary’s fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one (1) distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one (1) who shall not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of the death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">

    “Payment” means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one (1) or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer’s general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For purposes of subsections (4), (5), (6), and (7) of this section, the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment; and

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not “required to be made” to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.

    A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to KRS 386.450 to 386.504. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.

    If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal three percent (3%) of the fund’s value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund’s value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under 26 U.S.C. sec. 7520, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.

    After a trustee requested instruction pursuant to KRS 386.675(1), the circuit court did not err in ruling that the trustee acted within its authority under KRS 386.810(3)(s) and complied with its fiduciary duties under KRS 286.3-277, 386.800(3), 386.810(1) when the trustee opted to keep a mining lease in force despite the lessee’s alleged royalty shortfall and permit violation. There was conflicting evidence as to whether royalties had been underpaid, and the lessee had cured the alleged default by paying the disputed amount while the appeal was pending; moreover, an alleged mining permit violation could not serve as a basis to find the lessee in default absent an agency determination under KRS ch. 350 that such a violation existed.

There was conflicting evidence as to whether royalties had been underpaid, and the lessee had cured the alleged default by paying the disputed amount while the appeal was pending; moreover, an alleged mining permit violation could not serve as a basis to find the lessee in default absent an agency determination under KRS ch. 350 that such a violation existed.

Unless otherwise designated in the trust instrument, the principal place of administration of a trust is the trustee’s usual place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or at the trustee’s residence if he or she has no such place of business. In the case of cotrustees, the principal place of administration, if not otherwise designated in the trust instrument, is:

    In all other cases, the usual place of business or residence of any of the cotrustees as agreed on by them.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    The duty to register under this section shall not apply to the trustee of a trust if registration would be inconsistent with the retained jurisdiction of a foreign court from which the trustee cannot obtain release, nor does the duty to register under this section apply to any trust, whether testamentary or inter vivos, revocable or irrevocable, unless the settlor of the trust so directs.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)

    Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which he or she acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust:
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (a)
    </span>
    In the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate;

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (b)
    </span>

   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this Commonwealth is ineffective until the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred, or an instrument signed by the trustee and all beneficiaries is filed with the registration in this state.

    By registering a trust, or accepting the trusteeship of a registered trust, the trustee submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding under this chapter relating to the trust that may be initiated by any interested person while the trust remains registered. Notice of any proceeding shall be given pursuant to KRS 386B.1-070.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">

    A trustee who fails to register a trust in a proper place pursuant to this chapter, for purposes of any proceedings initiated by a beneficiary of the trust prior to registration, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of any court in which the trust could have been registered.

The words “sole,” “absolute,” “uncontrolled,” or words of similar import in the absence of any standards to guide the trustee in exercising its discretion mean that a reasonableness standard will not apply.

    Because a ward’s prior guardian retained a lawyer to represent the ward in a tort action, the lawyer’s professional duties extended to the ward, and an attorney-client relationship existed between the lawyer and the ward; thus, a substitute guardian had standing to bring a legal malpractice action against the lawyer based on his representation of the ward in the tort action.

    Motion to compel arbitration was properly denied in a negligence case against a health care center because there was no valid arbitration agreement under KRS 417.050; a patient was unable to ratify the signature on the arbitration agreement due to incompetence, and the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services was not a principal based upon its judicial appointment as an agent. The elements of estoppel were not met where it was clear that a power of attorney given to the patient’s son was limited to criminal charges, there was no language of durability, and preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act was not shown based on KRS 417.200 where subject matter jurisdiction was not an issue in the case.

Thurman, 98 Ky. 578, 33 S.W. 834, 17 Ky. L. Rptr. 1222, 1896 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. 1896). See Commonwealth v. Tilton, 111 Ky. 341, 63 S.W. 602, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 753, 1901 Ky. LEXIS 198 (Ky. Ct.

    Judge’s merely being satisfied with sufficiency of surety will not exonerate him from liability to the ward for failing to require sufficient surety; he is liable if he accepts insufficient surety without exercising ordinary care to acquaint himself with the solvency of the surety.

    The judge is not an insurer of the solvency of the sureties he accepts on guardians’ bonds, and if the evidence before him as to their solvency is such as would satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and judgment, he is not liable for loss occasioned by their insolvency.

    When a minor or other person under disability, having no guardian or conservator, is entitled to receive a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), exclusive of interest, in any action in which real estate has been sold or in the settlement of any estate or from any other source, the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability may settle or compromise the dollar amount when in the interest of the minor or other person under disability. The court in which the action is pending, or, if the sum does not derive from the action, the District Court, may order the sum to be paid to the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability. Before entering the order, the court shall approve any settlement or compromise and shall be satisfied by affidavit or oral testimony that the minor or other person under disability is in the custody of the person to whom it is proposed to pay the money and the latter, upon withdrawal of the money, shall be under obligation as trustee to expend it, for the support, maintenance, or education of the minor or other person under disability. When the order is made, no bond shall be required of the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability and the purchaser of the real property may pay the share of the minor or other person under disability into court, and no lien shall remain on the property therefor and the money may be withdrawn by the person mentioned in the order without that person giving bond. A release executed by the person to whom the court has ordered the sum paid shall have the same effect as a release by a duly appointed guardian.

   </h3>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (1)
    </span>
    No appointment of a guardian ad litem shall be made until the defendant is summoned, or until a person is summoned for him, as is authorized by law; nor until an affidavit of the plaintiff, or of his attorney, be filed in court, or with the clerk, showing that the defendant has no guardian, curator, nor conservator, residing in this state, known to the affiant.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)
    </span>
    A guardian ad litem must be a regular, practicing attorney of the court and may be appointed by the court, whether a guardian, curator, or conservator appear for the defendant or not. The guardian ad litem may be appointed upon the motion of the plaintiff or of any friend of the defendant; but neither the plaintiff nor his attorney shall be appointed, nor be permitted to suggest the name of the proposed guardian ad litem; and the court may change the guardian so appointed whenever the interest of the infant may appear to require such change.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)
    </span>
    It shall be the duty of the guardian ad litem to attend properly to the preparation of the case; and in an ordinary action he may cause as many witnesses to be subpoenaed as he may think proper, subject to the control of the court; and in an equitable action he may take depositions, not, however, exceeding three (3), without leave of the court.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    The court shall allow to the guardian ad litem a reasonable fee for his services, to be paid by the plaintiff and taxed in the costs. The affidavit of such guardian, or of another person, or other competent evidence, is admissible to prove the services rendered, but not to prove their value. The court must decide concerning such value, without reference to the opinions of parties or other witnesses.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)
    </span>
    Whether appointed pursuant to this statute or pursuant to a provision of the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, the duties of a guardian ad litem shall be to advocate for the client’s best interest in the proceeding through which the guardian ad litem was appointed. Without an appointment, the guardian ad litem shall have no obligation to initiate action or to defend the client in other proceedings.

    Any person of full age and sound mind may execute a verified petition for the voluntary appointment of a guardian or a conservator of that person’s property upon the express condition that the petition shall be acted upon by the court only upon the occurrence of an event specified or the existence of a described condition of the mental or physical health of the petitioner, the occurrence of which event, or the existence of which condition, shall be established in the manner directed in the petition. The petition, when filed, shall be accompanied by an affidavit from a licensed physician indicating that the person who signed the petition is now disabled as defined in KRS 387.510. The petition shall advise the proposed ward of a guardian’s powers as provided in KRS 387.065 and conservator’s powers as provided in KRS 387.137.

    The petition may be revoked by the petitioner at any time before appointment of a guardian or conservator by the court, if the petitioner is of sound mind. Revocation shall be accomplished by the destruction of the petition by the petitioner, or by the execution of an acknowledged instrument of revocation. If the petition has been deposited with the clerk, the revocation may be deposited there.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)

    At any time after the deposit of the petition with the clerk, and before its revocation, it may be brought on for hearing by the filing of a verified statement to the effect that the occurrence of the event or the condition provided for in the petition has come to pass. If the petition has not been deposited with the clerk under the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, it may be brought on for hearing at any time by the filing of it and the verified statement with the circuit clerk of the county in which the person who executed the petition then resides.

     1. Purpose.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    The purpose of this section is to appoint a person to take care of the day-to-day personal business of an incompetent. The scope of authority, duties and accountability of a guardian is much broader than that of a traditional power of attorney, even one intended to survive disability. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian. DeGrella v. Elston, 858 S.W.2d 698, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 103 (Ky. 1993).

    <span class="boldspan">
     2. Legislative Intent.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    Subsection (4) of this section merely advises the trial court of the legislative intent to impose the least restrictive measures under the individual’s circumstances. The trial judge is not granted authority by this section to forego a hearing as set forth in KRS 387.570, because he is of the opinion that the respondent is being adequately taken care of by other means. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).

     3. Due Process.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    Due process protections which are a part of the formal guardianship hearing do not vitiate the need for a hearing at the time of commitment. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).

    <span class="boldspan">
     4. Accountability.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    A guardian is answerable to a court and must file accountings at least annually; the attorney-in-fact is answerable and accountable only to the principal who may be mentally disabled. It is obvious that there must be adequate safeguards and control on the person who manages an incompetent’s estate and that a great disparity exists between the durable power of attorney and a guardian. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <h4 class="p7" id="tXXXIIIc387s387.500-5.durablepowerofattorney.">
    <span class="boldspan">
     5. Durable Power of Attorney.
    </span>
   </h4>
   <p class="p8">
    The durable power of attorney is not a substitute for the appointment of a guardian. The existence of a durable power of attorney cannot prevent the institution of guardianship proceedings. The disabled person is entitled to have the district court exercise control and supervision of her estate by the impaneling of a jury to determine whether she is disabled pursuant to chapter 387 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and if so to appoint a guardian in accordance with that chapter, and if a fiduciary is appointed then the power of attorney-in-fact shall terminate and an account must be given to the court-appointed fiduciary. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The durable power of attorney provided by KRS 386.093 does not make the appointment of a guardian automatically unnecessary. It was not intended to supplant the provisions of this section. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS 311.631(1), entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 177 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

    By the repeal of KRS Chapter 203, the General Assembly intended to place the filing of disability judgments and the indexing of same as a responsibility of the circuit clerk, instead of the county clerk. Thus on and after July 1, 1982, there is no statutory basis for filing disability judgments and indexing them in the county clerk’s office. OAG 82-486.

    The effect of subsection (8) of this section is that the judgment of disability or partial disability must be filed in the District Court. Thus the Circuit Court-District Court clerk must see to it that such judgments are filed in the clerk’s office; and the circuit clerk must establish, on and after July 1, 1982, an index system covering such judgments collected in a book identifiable as involving notices of actions and encumbrances. OAG 82-486.

   <p class="p8">
    Subsection (8) of this section when read as a whole, requires that a certified copy of the judgment of disability must be filed in the county clerk’s office for unless this is done, notice to any subsequent bona fide purchaser for value, mortgagee, or encumbrancer will not be afforded.

   <p class="p8">
    Concerning the county clerk’s fee for filing and indexing a certified copy of a disability judgment under subsection (8) of this section, the proper fee for the county clerks to accompany such filing and indexing is five dollars for filing miscellaneous documents for which no specific fee is set, where the record does not exceed three pages; where such document exceeds three pages, for each additional page the clerk’s fee is one dollar and fifty cents.

    The right to withdrawal of medical treatment for a person in a persistent vegetative state exists within the framework of the individual’s common law rights of self-determination and informed consent in obtaining medical treatment, and these rights can be exercised by an incompetent person through the process of surrogate decision-making so long as the wishes of the patient were known.

    In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS 311.631(1), entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 177 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

    Guardian has the authority to enter into collateral agreements which may affect the jural rights of her ward, and a guardian’s decision to execute an optional arbitration agreement must be in the ward’s best interest. Therefore, arbitration could have been compelled in a negligence and personal injury case because a guardian had the authority to execute an optional arbitration agreement on behalf of her ward for admission to a long-term care facility.

    (7/12/2012). In subsection (4) of this statute, the Reviser of Statutes has inserted the phrase “KRS 387.855 to
    387.910” in place of a reference to a single statute. In subsection (4) of
    2012 Ky. Acts ch. 59, sec. 9, the term “the court” is defined “for the purposes of Section 8 of this Act,” but the term does not appear in Section 8, and it is clear from the context that the definition is intended to apply to the entire range of statutes. This manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected under
    KRS 7.136(1).

    Whenever in a proceeding for the trial and commitment of any person who appears to be mentally disabled it is determined that such person is either an individual with an intellectual disability, an epileptic, or a mentally ill person and ought to be committed for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government, the court of the county in which such person is found, having jurisdiction in such matters, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans Affairs or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit such person to the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment. Thereafter, such person, upon admission to any such facility, shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government. The chief officer of any such facility or institution to which such person is committed under the provisions of this section shall be vested with the same powers as are exercised by superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with respect to the retention, transfer, parole or discharge of the person so committed.

    In action to sell infant’s land for support and maintenance, the failure to file the title papers under which the property of the infant was held did not make the judgment void; it was erroneous only, and the error could not be taken advantage of collaterally in another suit. National Surety Co. v. Rives' Guardian, 164 Ky. 201, 175 S.W. 351, 1915 Ky. LEXIS 355 (Ky. 1915) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A judgment confirming a decretal judicial sale of the vested real property of an infant would not be reversed upon appeal for the single reason that the judgment under which the sale was made was erroneous and was reversed after the sale was made and confirmed and deed made to purchaser, where the court which rendered the judgment decreeing the sale had competent jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the action, and the sale was regularly and fairly made, to a bona fide purchaser. Webb v. Webb's Guardian, 178 Ky. 152, 198 S.W. 736, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 706 (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).

    Bona fide purchaser of land of infant, the sale of which was later declared void, who placed lasting and valuable improvements on it under the good-faith belief that he owns its perfect title, may, as against the true owner, have a lien on it, not for their cost, but to the extent that they have enhanced its vendible value, not to exceed their cost. Hurt's Guardian v. Crawford Coal Corp., 222 Ky. 504, 1 S.W.2d 955, 1927 Ky. LEXIS 954 (Ky. 1927) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    A judgment selling the land of infants is void only if the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject or the parties, all of whom must be treated as being of full legal capacity, and, accordingly, mere irregularities and even prejudicial errors of reversible magnitude cannot overthrow a judgment on the ground of voidness, provided the rendering court had jurisdiction of the suit’s subject and parties. Hudson v. Hightower, 307 Ky. 295, 210 S.W.2d 933, 1948 Ky. LEXIS 723 (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Failure to deliver summons to mother on behalf of her minor children did not make an uncontested judgment for sale of real estate of these children void where the mother received a copy of the summons in her own behalf, the person actually having charge of the children received copies of the summons in their behalf, and a guardian ad litem represented the children and duly made his report. Hudson v. Hightower, 307 Ky. 295, 210 S.W.2d 933, 1948 Ky. LEXIS 723 (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    An untrue affidavit for appointment of a warning order attorney for an infant owner of real property who was not a nonresident but was merely absent in military service does not make an uncontested judgment for the sale of such real estate void, but merely voidable, and where the judgment is not appealed within 90 days of the infant’s discharge from military service such defect is waived. Hudson v. Hightower, 307 Ky. 295, 210 S.W.2d 933, 1948 Ky. LEXIS 723 (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Purchase by parents at decretal sale, without court permission, of property, all of which they owned except small contingent fractional interests held by their children, was not antagonistic to the children’s interests and, in any event, could not render void the judgment or the transfer of the title by judicial deed.

   <li class="p6">
    In the event the power of a fiduciary to sell or mortgage any real estate is expressly limited by the will or trust instrument under which he is acting, such limitation may only be altered or amended by the Circuit Court of the county wherein the fiduciary was appointed, or if the fiduciary is acting under an agreement of trust without court supervision, the county in which the trust is or could be registered, in an action brought by the fiduciary in which all persons having a present or contingent interest in the property interest sought to be sold or mortgaged or its proceeds are made parties. Before adjudging that the fiduciary may deviate from the terms of the will or trust the court shall determine that there exist circumstances apparently unknown to the testator or settlor; that such circumstances would substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes intended; and that deviation is in the best interests of all parties concerned.

    When two (2) or more persons other than tenants by the entirety in residential property actually occupied by them as a principal residence share title to real estate in such manner that a conveyance by them jointly would pass a fee simple title, any one (1) or more of them may bring an action for the sale or division thereof in the Circuit Court of the county in which the land, or the greater part thereof, lies, making parties defendant those owners who have not joined as plaintiffs. A fiduciary possessing a power of sale may institute such an action against owners of interests not represented by him. Defendant owners shall be brought before the court in the manner provided by the civil rules whether or not a fiduciary possesses a power of sale of the defendant’s interest, but any fiduciary possessing such a power shall also be made a defendant. The case shall be tried without a jury.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (2)

    A defendant who is under disability and for whom no fiduciary is acting shall be represented in the action by a guardian ad litem, but in the event of sale of such defendant’s interest the court shall retain control of the proceeds of such interest until a duly appointed and adequately bonded fiduciary or custodian pursuant to a court order makes claim to the funds.

   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (3)

    In all such actions indivisibility of the real estate shall be presumed unless an issue in respect thereto is raised by the pleading of any party, and if the court is satisfied from the evidence that the property is divisible, without materially impairing the value of any interest therein, division thereof pursuant to KRS 381.135 shall be ordered.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (4)
    </span>
    If a sale of all or any part of the real estate shall be ordered, the court shall refer the matter to the master commissioner or appoint a commissioner to conduct a public sale and convey the property upon terms of sale and disposition of the net proceeds as may have been determined by the court.
   </li>
   <li class="p6">
    <span class="boldspan">
     (5)

    The death of any party pending the action and prior to distribution of the proceeds of sale or setting apart a divisible share shall not affect the action but the court may direct distribution or apportionment to the successors in interest of the decedent upon application therefor.

    When two (2) or more persons share title to real estate but an interest therein may be possessed by persons unborn or not immediately ascertainable, an action for sale or division may be brought in the same manner as provided in KRS 389A.030 but the interest of the unborn or unascertainable persons, unless a living member of the class to which such persons belong who is sui juris is a party to the action, shall be represented by a guardian ad litem who is not acting in such capacity for any other party to the action. In the event of sale or division under this section, the court shall apply the provisions of subsection (6) of KRS 389A.030 to preserve the interest of the unborn or unascertainable persons until they are born, ascertained or the class to which they belong otherwise closes.
