    (3/30/90). The definition of
    “animal” contained in subsection (2) of this section does not
    reflect the amendatory language contained in Senate Bill 263 of the 1980 Regular
    Session of the Kentucky General Assembly because the 1980 Senate Journal indicates
    that Senate Bill 263 was vetoed by Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., on April 9,
    1980, and recommitted by action of the Senate to its Committee on Appropriations
    and Revenue on April 14, 1980. Senate Bill 263 proposed to change subsection
    (2) to read as follows: “‘Animal’ includes every warmblooded
    living creature except birds and human beings;”. By a letter dated March
    16, 1990, the Attorney General has informally opined that Governor Brown’s
    veto of Senate Bill 263 was not timely; that letter has exhibits showing that
    the bill was received by the Governor on March 28, 1980, and that his veto
    was received by the Senate Clerk on April 10, 1980.

   <p class="p9">
    In order to qualify as a “ministerial officer”
    entitled to carry a concealed weapon under the exception of KRS 435.230(2)
    (repealed), a coroner must actually be engaged in some phase of law enforcement
    work involving the duties and powers of arrest exercised by sheriffs, constables,
    marshals and policemen. OAG 67-63.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    In the absence of a written demand as set out in KRS 43.050(2)(b), an audit by the auditor of public accounts of local officials
    in their handling of fines, forfeitures, and legal process taxes is permissive
    only. OAG 67-320.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since a constable is a peace officer he may execute
    a warrant of arrest as provided by RCr 2.10. OAG 70-131.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A deputy constable is not disqualified from serving in that capacity because of his residing in a district other than that in which the constable resides. OAG 70-187.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The appointment of a commissioner of a water district
    to a second term prior to the conclusion of his first term was not valid where
    the appointing judge died prior to the commencement of the second term and
    a successor judge was appointed in his place. OAG 70-422.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A peace officer is a peace officer 24 hours a day, and he has a continuing right and duty to act in behalf of the people generally even during his off-duty hours. OAG 70-726.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A peace officer’s right of arrest is not diminished by accepting private employment during his off-duty hours. OAG 70-726.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    An arrest, effected under the requirements of KRS 431.005 by a marshal of a sixth-class city, may be made outside of the subject
    city but within the marshal’s county. OAG 71-26.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    An ordinance granting and clothing the fire chief
    with all power and privileges of regular policemen would be invalid. OAG 71-322.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    If a warrant, or criminal summons, is issued by a
    justice of the peace and delivered to the sheriff or one (1) of his deputies,
    the sheriff, or a deputy, is required to execute it, since the sheriff and
    his deputies are peace officers. OAG 71-365.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A special local peace officer at a state university
    would not be a peace officer as defined in this section but would merely be
    an employe of a state agency. OAG 72-315.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A county jailer, as a peace officer, has the duty
    and authority to arrest a drunk who knocks on the door of the county jail
    and place him in jail, subject to his being taken before a magistrate without
    unnecessary delay. OAG 73-163.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The semiannual filing with the workers’ compensation
    board approval of insurance form designated form 14 is mandatory since the
    statute uses the word “shall,” and under subsection (29) (now (30)) of this
    section, “shall” is mandatory and therefore until the legislature
    qualifies KRS 432.340(2) (repealed), any proposal to modify the reporting
    form by eliminating the semiannual filing would be illegal. OAG 73-258.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Under the definition in subsection (24) (now (25)) state probation
    and parole officers cannot be considered “peace officers” and
    do not possess the power of arrest except when acting under KRS 439.430 or
    KRS 439.570. OAG 73-405.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The terms “town” and “city”
    mean the same thing under Kentucky law so that incorporation as a town constitutes
    a city of the sixth class and, unless said town has been dissolved by statutory
    procedure, such town is entitled to issue industrial revenue bonds. OAG 73-793.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    An ordinance establishing a county detective as a
    peace officer under KRS 67.083 is invalid as it is in conflict with subdivision
    (19) (now subdivision (25)) of this section. OAG 74-303 (Opinion prior to
    1974 amendment).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    High school girls under eighteen (18) years of age
    hired as meter maids to patrol metered parking areas and ticket automobiles
    whose parking time has expired and who are not sworn in as peace officers
    of the police department or bonded as such are not peace officers within this
    section. OAG 74-552.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The extended meaning of “person,” as found
    in this section should not be used in interpreting “person” as
    it is used in KRS 164.720. OAG 78-247.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since a mobile home or recreational vehicle permanently
    fixed to the land is considered part of the real estate, it follows that one
    which is not permanently fixed to the land, or has been or will be severed
    from the land, is no longer considered real estate but personal property.
    OAG 80-513.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The statutory definition of “may”, which
    is defined as “permissive” under subdivision (20) of this section,
    does not apply to subdivision (1)(c) of KRS 67.080, when viewed in its total
    context, since the courts have held that the fiscal court has almost unlimited
    control of the fiscal affairs of a county and the exercise of that control
    by fiscal court is mandatory. OAG 81-203.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Nonstate officers, including federal officers, who
    qualify as “peace officers” under this section, are entitled to
    carry concealed weapons in the discharge of their official duties and if necessary
    for their protection, pursuant to subsection (2) of KRS 527.020, since subsection
    (3) of KRS 527.020 is directed to state, county and city officers and thus,
    by implication, subsection (2) applies to all other peace officers. OAG 81-226.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The word “shall,” is normally considered
    a mandatory word pursuant to subsection (29) (now (3)) of this section; however, this
    is not always the case as the word’s ultimate significance is to be determined
    from the act as a whole and its legislative intent. OAG 82-102.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The only legal deputy sheriffs are those appointed by the sheriff to fill deputy positions authorized by the urban county council pursuant to KRS 64.530, 67A.060, 67A.300, and unsalaried deputy sheriffs, called “courtesy special deputies,” are illegal; such illegal deputies are merely private persons and would have the power of arrest given to private persons under KRS 431.005(2), but they are not peace officers and they cannot carry concealed deadly weapons for any reason. OAG 82-105.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The county jailer and his deputies are “peace
    officers” under this section. OAG 82-625.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The fiscal court, in an ordinance creating an auxiliary
    county police force, has the authority to extend to such auxiliary county
    policemen the full powers of arrest of a statutory peace officer, including
    the right to carry a weapon; under these county legislative conditions, and
    once the auxiliary county policemen have been duly appointed and have taken
    oath, they become policemen and “peace officers” as long as they
    remain on the force. OAG 83-58.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A regular county policeman is a “peace officer,”
    under KRS 431.005 and subdivision (24) (now (25)) of this section, at all times. OAG
    83-90.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    A county judge/executive cannot refuse to accept the
    full mandatory salary provided by KRS 67.705 and 64.527, and he must be paid
    back pay for any year in which he was not paid the amount required by statute.
    OAG 84-381.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The second sentence of KRS 66.480(1)(a) should not
    be read as restrictive, but rather as permissive; by the use of the term “may”
    defined in subsection (1) of this section, the provision would allow the method
    set forth therein but would also allow the use of other methods, such as purchase
    through brokerage firms. OAG 90-28.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    According to the definition of “animal,”
    a chicken is not an animal. OAG 92-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Certain parties may experiment with the disposal of
    poultry carcasses by composting them. Since chickens are not animals under
    the definition of “animal”, the disposal of chicken carcasses
    is not subject to regulation under this section. OAG 92-97.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    “Volunteer” deputy sheriffs are, from
    a legal perspective, “special deputy sheriffs” (KRS 70.045). A
    “volunteer” (special) deputy sheriff, appointed for “general
    law enforcement” pursuant to KRS 70.045(1) has the same powers, except
    in the case of a warrantless arrest pursuant to KRS 431.005(2), as a “regular”
    or paid deputy sheriff. A special deputy appointed for “emergency circumstances”
    under KRS 70.045(2) has the powers of a special deputy sheriff only during
    preparation for, or the occurrences of, emergencies such as fire, flood, storm,
    or other “such emergencies.” The sheriff must cause signification
    of the statutory provision under which a special deputy is appointed to appear
    on the county clerk order book together with the deputy’s name. OAG 95-22.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Since officers and agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
    Service are not listed among the particular federal authorities designated
    as peace officers under KRS 61.365, they do not have such status for the purpose
    of making an arrest or issuing a citation for a violation of Kentucky law;
    furthermore, officers or agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cannot
    be considered “peace officers” on the basis of being included
    among “others with similar authority to make arrests” described
    in subsection (24) (not (25)) of this section. OAG 95-30.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    For purposes of submitting an open records request
    or appealing to the Attorney General, the term “person” may extend
    to an unincorporated association. 95-ORD-9.

    Department’s change which raised state tax obligation of public service company (PSC) and made it subject to local taxes was upheld because general assembly did not intend for franchise of PSCs to be exempt from state and local taxes and intended for it to be taxed separately. KRS 136.115(2) directed that taxes were assessed on operating tangible property and franchise; franchise was separate and nothing in the statutes indicated that franchise was included in operating tangible property. Additionally, KRS 132.208 provides a state and local tax exemption for intangible personal property except that which is assessed under KRS ch. 136. Dayton Power & Light Co. v.

    Court clerks had no private right of action to sue defendants for any alleged violation of Kentucky’s recording requirements because the clerks had no actionable claim directly under KRS 382.360, and because the clerks were not within the class of persons intended to be protected by KRS 382.360, they had no KRS 446.070 claim; the fact that a statute should be liberally construed did not compel a finding that the Kentucky legislature intended to protect the clerks where there was no such indication to be gleaned from the statutory text, legislative history, or state-law authorities interpreting the recording statutes.

    year she remained on this teaching regimen by teacher’s retirement system,
    as was the custom at that time, a regulation adopted thereafter, which would

    The statutory lien provisions of KRS 134.230(4) and
    (5) repealed by the 1982 amendment to that section remain in effect for sheriffs
    currently in office, as the amending act does not expressly state that its

    The retrospective application of a law is not to be

    The deletion of Section 2 of House Bill 7, which requires
    that the amendment contained in Section 1 of the Bill apply only to criminal
    offenses committed after the effective date of the Bill, will not effect the
    application of the proposed revision of KRS 439.3401 because of the constitutional
    prohibition against ex post facto laws and because of the requirement of subsection

    public interest, and the rule of statutory construction, codified at subsection
    (1) of this section, that all statutes are to be interpreted with a view to
    promote their objects and carry out the intent of the legislature, compels

    Section 228 of the Constitution requires an officer
    taking the oath of office to be a citizen or resident of Kentucky, and Const.,
    § 234 requires all civil officers of Kentucky to reside in Kentucky;
    therefore, that provision of KRS 423.110(6) relating to the appointment of
    a special notary living in a foreign jurisdiction is unconstitutional. However,
    under the principle of severability, as expressed in this section and KRS 423.110, minus the offending language involving appointing nonresidents, is
    constitutional; thus the special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under
    KRS 423.110, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that
    such exercise of functions does not violate the public policy of or is not
    in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction. OAG 85-36.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Subsections (2) through (4) of KRS 230.377 can and
    should be severed from the remaining provisions of Acts 1988, ch. 376. The
    remaining provisions are not inseparably connected with and dependent upon
    those subsections and are capable of being executed in accordance with the
    intent of the General Assembly. Each racing commission may promulgate necessary
    and reasonable administrative regulations to provide for the conditions under
    which simulcasting may be conducted. Therefore, the remaining statutory provisions
    of Acts 1988, ch. 376 can and should remain in force. OAG 88-51.
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    Section 119.025, in its entirety, is unconstitutional;
    it is not amenable to severability because the provisions are too intertwined,
    thus making it impossible to determine the intent of the legislature if one
    or the other of the two (2) subsections are deemed to be unconstitutional.
    OAG 89-84.

    Courts are required to sentence a defendant in accordance with the laws in effect at the time the offense was committed unless the defendant specifically consents to the application of the new law that mitigates his punishment, and it must be evident from the record that the defendant has consented to a punishment that is mitigated by a new law in order to benefit from the same; although the amendment to KRS 532.110 was in effect when defendant was tried and sentenced, there was no evidence in the record that he requested to be sentenced under the new law that would have mitigated his sentence, and he was correctly sentenced under KRS 532.110 as it read prior to its amendment in 1998.

    Defendant’s pretrial motion in his capital murder case, whereby defendant advised the trial court that he consented to the application of the 1998 amendments to KRS 532.030 and requested that the trial court include life without parole as a sentencing option available to the jury if the trial proceeded to a capital sentencing phase, satisfied the unqualified consent requirement; accordingly, defendant was entitled to an instruction on life without parole, and a new capital sentencing phase before the trial court was required because the trial court failed to so instruct the jury.

    The act (Acts 1942, ch. 208) revising the statutes
    did not violate Const., § 51 for the different chapters and sections
    were germane and related to the one object of gathering together a unified
    system of law in a clarified and concise form for convenient use and division
    among separate acts would not only have been contrary to the spirit of the
    constitution but would also have been embarrassing to honest legislation. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294 Ky. 122, 171 S.W.2d 41, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 404 (Ky. 1943).

    The Kentucky Revised Statutes were enacted as the

    revising the statutes is the law and not merely evidence of the law; the Kentucky
    Revised Statutes repealed all former statutes. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294 Ky. 122, 171 S.W.2d 41, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 404 (Ky. 1943).

    Resort may be had to the notes or reports of commissioners
    who drafted a revision of statutes in the case of an ambiguity in the revision,
    but not otherwise. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294 Ky. 122, 171 S.W.2d 41, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 404 (Ky. 1943).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The courts may not resort to legislative history
    for the purpose of construing a statute where there can be no question as
    to the intent of the legislature, but where the literal meaning of a statute
    makes it a substantial departure from the long-established legislative policy
    on the subject, known to the court, the doubt thereby arising as to the legislative
    intent requires an examination of available information bearing on the purpose
    to be accomplished by the legislation in question. Swift v. Southeastern Greyhound Lines, 294 Ky. 137, 171 S.W.2d 49, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 405 (Ky. 1943).
   </p>
   <p class="p9">
    The Kentucky Revised Statutes are controlling where
    the proceedings in question arose after the Kentucky Revised Statutes became
    effective, but the court may examine the historical setting of the revised
    sections to aid in their construction. Morgan v. Fayette County Board of Education, 294 Ky. 597, 172 S.W.2d 64, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 480 (Ky. 1943).

    Where a subsection was ambiguous as it appeared in
    the revised statutes, reference could be had to legislative history for the
    purpose of resolving the ambiguity or for the purpose of applying the rules

   <p class="p9">
    Resort may not be had to the original acts from which
    the 1942 revision of the statutes was derived except in the case of an ambiguity
    in the revision. Ambiguity that will permit a reference to former statutes
    may exist on its face, or may develop when the statute is brought into contact
    with collateral facts, as where the consequences or results of a literal construction
    would be absurd or unreasonable, or may arise from a conflict between the
    provisions of one section and those of other sections in pari materia. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294 Ky. 122, 171 S.W.2d 41, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 404 (Ky. 1943).

    If a section of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, as

    Repeals by implication are not favored, and a statute
