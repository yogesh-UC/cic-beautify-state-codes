    This section expressly covers condemnation of a railroad
    right of way but has been adopted by reference and used for condemnation of
    highway and other public purposes, and a jury in a proceeding under KRS 177.081
    to 177.089 (now repealed), to condemn a highway right of way and temporary easement must,
    at the request of either party, view the premises as provided in KRS 416.050
    (now repealed). Commonwealth v. Farra, 338 S.W.2d 696, 1960 Ky. LEXIS 407 (Ky. 1960).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Originally the railroad method under this section
    or the park method under KRS 416.120 (now repealed) were the only statutory
    procedures for condemnation in Kentucky and public agencies with the power
    of condemnation were authorized to follow one or the other but since 1942
    many new procedures have been prescribed by statute for use by different classes
    of condemnors and, since railroad procedure was authorized by KRS 58.140 in
    1946 to be used in condemning for public projects generally and since railroads
    were authorized by KRS 416.015 (now repealed) in 1958 to use alternate procedures,
    the authorization granted by KRS 58.140 reasonably should be considered to
    extend so as to embrace the alternative procedures specified in KRS 416.230. Epperson v. Briscoe Manor Sewer Constr. Dist., 420 S.W.2d 390, 1966 Ky. LEXIS 3 (Ky. 1966).

    In condemnation proceedings, adaptability for particular

    Although subsection (2) of this section provides that
    a power company may condemn in the manner provided in the Eminent Domain Act
    and KRS 416.560(4), which is part of that act, does not contain any requirement
    of a bond in connection with a precondemnation survey of the land, the provision
    of subsection (1) of this section, requiring such a bond is controlling as
    being the later and more specific statute on the subject of prefile survey
    and damage to land; accordingly, a rural power cooperative was required to
    post bond before making a survey and appraisal of private property for the
    purpose of constructing a transmission line and prior to the filing of a petition

    Although subsection (2) of this section provides that

    KRS 416.560(4) merely declares a cause of action for any prefile damages,
    and thus there is no basic disharmony or real conflict, since the bond merely
    guarantees recovery for any damages under the terms of the bond. OAG 81-383.

    The
    owner of real estate serving the public, providing sleeping accommodations
    and meals, when pure water is not available in adequate quantities, shall
    have the right to condemn on the banks of any navigable stream a tract of
    land not more than twenty (20) feet square and above the high water mark for
    a pumping station site and a right-of-way for a pipeline from said site to
    the deep water of the navigable stream and from said pumping station site
    to the point on the owner’s real estate where the water is desired for use.
    The said property owner may condemn a right-of-way for an electric power line
    over the most direct course to the pumping station site. In the event the
    owner of such real estate finds it more desirable to make connections with
    the water system of a municipality or a water supply line leading from a navigable
    stream to the municipality or other source of supply, then said real estate
    owner may, at his option, condemn a right-of-way for a pipeline from said
    city water system or water supply line or other source of supply to the point
    on the owner’s real estate where the water is desired for use, including such
    area as may be required to install and maintain pumps and meters for said
    water system and an electric line to conduct power to said pump with necessary
    electric control lines or apparatus. The owner of property condemning right-of-way for a water line under this section, may agree to supply the subject
    owner a quantity of water in lieu of cash compensation for the easement, and
    such agreement to supply water to the subject property owner shall not be
    construed to place a burden on the condemning party to supply water service
    to others or meet the obligation of a public utility to render water service.

    the property owner or the condemnor to introduce evidence as to the value
    of the land to be condemned and the incidental damages to adjacent property

    An air board need not proceed with a condemnation

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Under the associated words doctrine, the word “instrumentality”
    appearing in subsection (1) of this section must be of the same class as the
    categories “department” and “agency,” and since the
    riverport authority provided for in KRS 65.510 et seq., although lacking taxing
    power, possesses power to contract, borrow, and finance its own projects,
    it is not a department, instrumentality or agency of any county or city within
    the meaning of subsection (1) and may initiate condemnation proceedings on
    its own behalf. OAG 79-133.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Assuming that a riverport authority is an instrumentality
    or agency of the county, subsection (1) of this section and subsections (4)
    and (5) of KRS 65.530 are irreconcilable with respect to condemnation of property
    which the authority has been unable to purchase, since the first statute provides
    that the fiscal court would condemn and the second statute provides the riverport
    authority may, itself, condemn the property; however, since the legislature
    republished KRS 65.530 after the enactment of this section, it intended, as
    relates to the specific subject of riverport authorities, to impliedly repeal
    subsection (1) of this section to that extent since, whenever there are apparent
    irreconcilable conflicts in statutes, the later statute controls; thus, the
    riverport authority may proceed, with the consent of the fiscal court, to
    condemn the land under its own name. OAG 81-244.

    The Louisville Water Company, which is an agency and

    proceedings can be instituted. OAG 81-314.

   <p class="p8">
    Although KRS 416.130(2) provides that a power company
    may condemn in the manner provided in the Eminent Domain Act and subsection
    (4) of this section, which is part of that act, does not contain any requirement
    of a bond in connection with a precondemnation survey of the land, the provision
    of KRS 416.130(1), requiring such a bond is controlling as being the later
    and more specific statute on the subject of prefile survey and damage to land;
    accordingly, a rural power cooperative was required to post bond before making
    a survey and appraisal of private property for the purpose of constructing
    a transmission line and prior to the filing of a petition for condemnation.
    OAG 81-383.
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Although KRS 416.130(2) provides that condemnation
    shall be brought in the manner provided in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky
    and subsection (1) provides for a bond to cover prefile damages, subsection
    (4) of this section merely declares a cause of action for any prefile damages,
    and thus there is no basic disharmony or real conflict, since the bond merely
    guarantees recovery for any damages under the terms of the bond. OAG 81-383.

    A watershed conservancy district existing pursuant
    to KRS 262.700 et seq., with its defined though limited powers of government,
    including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and
    construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department,
    instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the Commonwealth in the
    sense contemplated by subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section. A watershed
    conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on
    its own behalf, since subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section have no
    application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district
    has received prior approval from the board of supervisors of the soil conservation
    district pursuant to KRS 262.745. OAG 82-272.

The property owner did not contest the right to take the property, but instead contested the valuation, and the trial court should have set the matter for a jury trial on compensation or made an interlocutory order and judgment final and appealable.

    Within
    thirty (30) days from the date of entry of an interlocutory judgment authorizing
    the petitioner to take possession of the property, exceptions may be filed
    by either party or both parties by filing with the clerk of the Circuit Court
    and serving upon the other party or parties a statement of exceptions, which
    statement shall contain any exceptions the party has to the award made by
    the commissioners. The statement of exceptions shall be tried, but shall be
    limited to the questions which are raised in the original statements of the
    exceptions, or as amended, but the owner shall not be permitted to raise any
    question, nor shall the court reconsider any question so raised, concerning
    the right of the petitioner to condemn the property. All questions of fact
    pertaining to the amount of compensation to the owner, or owners, shall be
    determined by a jury, which jury on the motion of either party shall be sent
    by the court, in the charge of the sheriff, to view the land and material.
    After a jury trial, and if possession previously has not been taken by the
    condemnor of the land and material condemned, it may do so upon the payment
    to the owner or to the clerk of the Circuit Court the amount of the compensation
    adjudged by the Circuit Court to be due the owner.

    nor shall the acceptance by the owner of the amount of the compensation awarded
    prejudice his right to except from the award of the commissioners or the judgment
    of any court.

    If
    the condemnor takes possession of the property condemned and the amount of
    compensation is thereafter increased over that awarded by the commissioners,
    the condemnor shall pay interest to the owner at the rate of six percent (6%)
    per annum upon the amount of such increase from the date the condemnor took
    possession of the property. If the condemnor takes possession of the property
    condemned and the amount of compensation is thereafter decreased below that
    awarded by the commissioners, the condemnor shall be entitled to a personal
    judgment against the owner for the amount of the decrease plus interest at
    the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date the owner accepted the
    amount of compensation the condemnor paid into court or to the owner. If the
    owner at all times refuses to accept the payment tendered by the condemnor,
    no interest shall be allowed in the judgment against the owner for the amount
    of the decrease.

    Metropolitan sewer district acted in bad faith during condemnation negotiations by making an inadequate last offer to the condemnee of $4,000 when it had previously offered $60,000. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the district’s conduct was not so prejudicial as to justify award of counsel fees to the condemnee. Golden Foods, Inc. v.

    Although attorney fees are generally not recoverable without a specific contractual provision or a fee-shifting statute, after the successful defense of a condemnation proceeding, a trial court may award attorney fees if the court determines that the condemnor has acted in bad faith or caused unreasonable delay. If a trial court finds such improper conduct, it should determine the extent that the condemnee has been prejudiced and whether he can be made reasonably whole by the imposition of costs and fees.

    In a condemnation case, a trial court erred when it dismissed a case for lack of prosecution because a statute was silent on the specific amount of time in which a trial on the exceptions and compensation was to be held, even though a property owner was entitled to a prompt trial on the issue of the condemnation itself. The property owner did not contest the right to take the property, but instead contested the valuation, and the trial court should have set the matter for a jury trial on compensation or made an interlocutory order and judgment final and appealable.

    Circuit court erred in denying a Medicaid managed care organization's request to enforce an arbitration agreement between it and a hospital because the insurer did not waive its right to invoke or enforce the arbitration clause in the provider agreement with its litigation conduct; no litigation activity had taken place with the exception of the filing of motions to dismiss.

The elements of estoppel were not met where it was clear that a power of attorney given to the patient’s son was limited to criminal charges, there was no language of durability, and preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act was not shown based on KRS 417.200 where subject matter jurisdiction was not an issue in the case.

    The KUAA clearly provides that a party has ninety days after delivery of an arbitration award to challenge the award. There is no legal barrier that would preclude a party adversely affected by an award of an arbitrator to assert a counterclaim challenging the award, if the prevailing party files an application with the court to confirm the award during the ninety-day period the aggrieved party has available to challenge the arbitration award.

    motions were brought in their original suit which had been dismissed earlier, and not by an initial application as required by KRS 417.190 to invoke trial court’s jurisdiction; because the buyers did not move to alter, amend, or vacate the trial court’s initial judgment dismissing their suit within 10 days, did not file a notice of appeal within 30 days, and did not seek application to compel arbitration while the trial court still retained jurisdiction, the trial court had no jurisdiction to enter its later orders.

    The plain meaning of this section is that the agreement,

    point, one looks to Ky. Const., § 112(5) and KRS 23A.010 to determine
    that the Circuit Court is the court of competent jurisdiction of this state;
    it would not promote uniformity for the court to interpret this section in

    The Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to order a limited liability company and its sole member to arbitrate their dispute with a seller, owner, and condominium council as described in a “Home Owners Limited Warranty” (HOLW) because the HOLW did not constitute the making of an agreement described in the Act, KRS 417.050, which was a predicate for jurisdiction under KRS 417.200. When the HOLW limited the effect of the member’s signature to a mere acknowledgment of receipt and not an assent to the terms thereof, the parties need not suffer the expense and delay of the arbitration hearing, only to find that the award is unenforceable, and when the issue arises prior to the arbitration hearing, and the agreement upon which arbitration is sought fails to comply with the literal provisions of KRS 417.200, the courts of Kentucky are without jurisdiction to enforce the agreement to arbitrate.

    Even though an arbitration clause in an operating agreement directed an arbitrator to apply the American Arbitration Association rules in effect in Kentucky, it did not include a purported forum selection clause explicitly requiring the arbitration to occur in Kentucky. The arbitration clause simply failed to designate where the arbitration was to take place, and such failure was fatal to the arbitration clause’s enforceability in Kentucky. Padgett v.

    Motion to compel arbitration was properly denied in a negligence case against a health care center because there was no valid arbitration agreement under KRS 417.050; a patient was unable to ratify the signature on the arbitration agreement due to incompetence, and the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services was not a principal based upon its judicial appointment as an agent. The elements of estoppel were not met where it was clear that a power of attorney given to the patient’s son was limited to criminal charges, there was no language of durability, and preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act was not shown based on KRS 417.200 where subject matter jurisdiction was not an issue in the case.

    Agreed case to determine whether infrared breath
    tester was “chemical test” presented a “justiciable controversy”
    because advance determination would minimize the risk of wrong action by the
    parties, and because a useful public purpose could be served by a judicial
    adjudication at the time; the requested declaration was both reasonable and
    necessary within the purview and design of this section. McConnell v. Commonwealth, 655 S.W.2d 43, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 339 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983), overruled,

    Despite the absence of designated antagonistic parties
    in an agreed case brought by county and state officials to resolve question
    of whether infrared breath tester qualified as “chemical test”
    under KRS 186.565 (now repealed), the issue had an immediacy and a useful
    public purpose could be served by a judicial adjudication; the issue was an
    immediate, prominent, and nonacademic concern to the public which the petitioning
    officials served and jurisdiction of the court in such case fell in the discretion
    of the court. McConnell v. Commonwealth, 655 S.W.2d 43, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 339 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983), overruled,

    In a case involving whether the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has the statutory authority to license the operation of mechanical and electronic devices for wagering on previously run horse races, the trial court erred when it concluded, prior to the intervention of a foundation, that the petition presented a justiciable controversy. However, the intervention of the foundation cured the constitutional infirmity, and the full participation by the foundation before the appellate courts presented a justiciable controversy.

    Where a sheriff of a county failed to execute bond
    as required by statute and the county judge declared the office vacant and
    appointed another to serve, and both were claiming the office, they may institute
    an action and submit an agreed statement of facts to the court and have it
    determined, upon such facts, as to which one is entitled to the office of
    sheriff of the county. Schuff v. Pflanz, 99 Ky. 97, 35 S.W. 132, 18 Ky. L. Rptr. 25, 1896 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. 1896).

    such affidavit was made in an agreed case and where the agreement only substituted
    a brief statement on the record for written pleadings, and did not dispense

   <p class="p8">
    It was not the purpose of the declaratory judgment
    act to impose on courts the burden of answering abstract and speculative propositions
    of law simply to satisfy the curiosity or fears of parties about possible
    controversies that may or may not arise out of their executed contract. Shearer v. Backer, 207 Ky. 455, 269 S.W. 543, 1925 Ky. LEXIS 112 (Ky. 1925).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Primary purpose of the declaratory judgment act is
    to relieve litigants of the common-law rule that no declaration of rights
    may be judicially adjudged unless a right has been violated, for the violation
    of which, relief may be granted. The statute is only applicable, however,
    when “it is made to appear that an actual controversy exists.” De Charette v. St. Matthews Bank & Trust Co., 214 Ky. 400, 283 S.W. 410, 1926 Ky. LEXIS 354 (Ky. 1926).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Declaratory judgment action was never intended as
    a substitute for a new trial, or other steps that code requires to be taken
    in the same action, or for an appeal to the Court of Appeals. Back's Guardian v. Bardo, 234 Ky. 211, 27 S.W.2d 960, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 1930).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    The purpose of the declaratory judgment act was to
    have a declaration of rights not theretofore determined, and not to determine
    whether rights theretofore adjudicated had been properly adjudicated. Back's Guardian v. Bardo, 234 Ky. 211, 27 S.W.2d 960, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 1930). See Ferree v. Ferree, 273 Ky. 238, 115 S.W.2d 1055, 1938 Ky. LEXIS 598 (Ky. 1938).

   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Declaratory judgment statute is very liberal with
    respect to both procedural and judicial discretion but courts should not decide
    speculative rights or duties although future contingencies may develop an
    actual justiciable controversy, and act expressly provides that Court of Appeals
    may in its discretion direct dismissal of the case in the trial court where
    it is considered to be necessary or proper under the circumstances, the same
    being without prejudice. Board of Education v. Muncy, 239 S.W.2d 471, 1951 Ky. LEXIS 893 (Ky. 1951).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    As a rule, the court has broad discretion to grant declaratory relief. The party seeking relief must show that an actual, justiciable controversy exists; proceedings for a declaratory judgment must not merely seek advisory answers to abstract questions.

Indeed, the state supreme court found that in its discretion pursuant to KRS 418.065 it could find that review of the trial and appellate court’s judgment finding the statutes and regulations were constitutional were not ripe for review and order further proceedings, as the administrative proceedings had not even been concluded.

    Inmate’s

    was not entitled to have Virginia’s prison disciplinary rules and regulations
    applied while incarcerated in the Kentucky facility under the Interstate Corrections
    Compact (ICC), KRS 196.610, because both the implementing transfer contract
    and art. IV(e) of the ICC indicated that the prison rules and regulations
    of the receiving state, Kentucky, applied and requiring receiving states to
    learn the policies and procedures of each sending state would have thwarted
    the ICC’s purpose of developing a cooperative prison program; thus, the inmate’s
    request for declaratory relief was properly decided adversely to the inmate. Vigue v. Underwood, 139 S.W.3d 168, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 24 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).

    Since a federal declaratory judgment would resolve the parties’
    dispute about whether an insurance policy covered a child’s injuries, and since the issue of insurance coverage was not before the state court in the child’s lawsuit against the insureds, and since the court could resolve the controversy based on undisputed facts, even though the controversy was governed by the Kentucky law and the insurer could have brought a declaratory judgment action in state court per KRS 418.040, the district court exercised its discretion to exercise jurisdiction over the insurance dispute pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2201(a).

    Single declaratory judgment action pursuant to KRS 418.040 and the civil rules was the appropriate vehicle for determination of all issues regarding implementation of the death penalty which were not cognizable in a defendant’s criminal action; when a capital defendant filed a declaratory judgment action, he had to join all claims then available to him with regard to the implementation of his judgment because res judicata would apply full force to bar successive declaratory judgment actions.

     Unpublished decision:
    </i>
    District court did not abuse its discretion in exercising jurisdiction over an insurer’s action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2201(a), in which the insurer sought a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured in a state court negligence action arising from a sailing accident; although the insurance coverage issue was governed by Kentucky law and KRS 418.040 provided a procedure for a declaration of rights, the district court properly concluded that the other factors clearly weighed in favor of the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction. Summary judgment for the insurer was proper because an exclusion provision in the homeowner policy precluded coverage; the uninsured sailboat owned by a third-party was in the care of the insured when it ran aground on a reef. W. Am. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, 208 Fed. Appx. 393, 2006 FED App. 0887N, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 30285 (6th Cir. Ky. 2006).

    Although the scope of the Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Act is liberal and wide, there are, however, limits. Declaratory judgment does not fit every occasion and does not replace the existing system of remedies and actions. For example, an action for a declaratory judgment cannot be instituted to secure a determination of substantive rights involved in a pending suit. Mammoth Med., Inc. v. Bunnell, 265 S.W.3d 205, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 224 (Ky. 2008).

    The “enumeration not exclusive” sentence in KRS 418.045 merely clarifies the principle that the section, enumerating certain specific situations, is not exclusive as to other situations.

Bunnell, 265 S.W.3d 205, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 224 (Ky. 2008).

    Insured’s claims against an insurer under tort law and KRS §§ 304.12-230, 367.170, were properly dismissed as barred under the res judicata doctrine because pursuant to CR 13.01, the insured should have raised the claims in the declaratory judgment suit that the insurer had previously filed, which sought a declaration as to the insured’s coverage under an insurance policy: (1) R. 13.01, Kentucky’s compulsory counterclaim rule, applied to declaratory judgment suits; (2) the insured’s claims had accrued by the time the declaratory judgment action was filed because they arose out of the insurer’s initial refuse to defend or indemnify her in a suit filed by a third party, which initial refusal occurred before the declaratory judgment suit was filed; and (3) in asserting her claims, the insured was doing more than merely attempting to enforce the declaratory judgment issued against the insured, as permitted under KRS § 418.055.

    The court may refuse to exercise
    the power to declare rights, duties or other legal relations in any case where
    a decision under it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which
    gave rise to the action, or in any case where the declaration or construction
    is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances. The appellate

    Although the court had inherent, as well as specific

    those who were actually parties to the action, the court did not have jurisdiction
    to include in such apportionment any property owners who were not named as
    plaintiffs, regardless of whether or not they were members of a class, or
    had executed an agreement to bear their proportionate part of the costs, and

That the Commonwealth could not successfully claim that the doctrine of sovereign immunity could bar a declaratory judgment action against it was evident in KRS 61.645(2)(a) that stated the Board could sue and be sued, which included the attempt under KRS 61.637(1) to reduce retiree benefits for those individuals who had returned to public employment and Ky.

    In habeas corpus proceeding, Court of Appeals is
    court of review only. Consequently, when no transcript of the hearing before
    the lower court was available there was nothing for the court to review and
    the appeal would be dismissed. Richardson v. Eaton, 402 S.W.2d 857, 1966 Ky. LEXIS 388 (Ky. 1966).

    Where a notice of appeal was filed in the circuit
    court on the date the Circuit Court’s order was entered but no notice was
    filed in the Court of Appeals or served on the other parties and the record
    was not filed within 30 days, the motion for appeal was overruled. Embry v. Commonwealth, 423 S.W.2d 523, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 486 (Ky. 1968).

   <p class="p8">
    Where the order appealed from was entered in circuit
    court July 13, 1970, with the record on appeal filed September 25, 1970, and
    the notice of appeal filed in Circuit Court July 29, 1970, but never filed
    in the Court of Appeals, the appeal was dismissed not only for untimely filing
    of the record but also for failure to follow the statutorily required procedure
    of filing the notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals. Luby v. Jackson, 460 S.W.2d 827, 1970 Ky. LEXIS 595 (Ky. 1970).

    Where Court of Appeals, on appeal of order denying
    habeas corpus, set aside that part of the order of the trial court which released
    the prisoners on bail pending appeal, it was not error or beyond the jurisdiction
    of the trial court to order rearrest of the prisoners while the appeal was
    pending. Crady v. Bensinger, 370 S.W.2d 820, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 79 (Ky. 1963).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Bond is authorized pending appeal in a habeas corpus
    proceeding only when the judgment has discharged the person detained, and
    this is not a bail bond but is a special security provision within the discretion
    of the court, as the prompt and summary manner in which the statutes direct
    both trial and appeal to be conducted in habeas corpus cases negates any intent
    that bail be allowed. Crady v. Cranfill, 371 S.W.2d 640, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 110 (Ky. 1963).
   </p>
   <p class="p8">
    Habeas corpus is essentially a civil proceeding and
    consequently the Rules of Criminal Procedure which might otherwise have justified
    the granting of bail pending appeal do not apply. Crady v. Cranfill, 371 S.W.2d 640, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 110 (Ky. 1963).

    On appeal of order denying application for release
    from custody on a writ of habeas corpus, Court of Appeals directed petitioner’s
    discharge from further custody where the county court had committed him to
    jail upon his failure to furnish $75,000 peace bond required by order of county
    judge, since the county judge did not have the power to set a peace bond at
    an amount greater than $5,000 or to order the defendant detained for more
    than three months in default of giving such security. Lunsford v. Commonwealth, 436 S.W.2d 512, 1969 Ky. LEXIS 482 (Ky. 1969).

   <p class="p8">
    The trial court was justified in staying execution
    of extradition order until termination of habeas corpus proceedings including
    any appeal from order denying writ since it appeared to be the best means
    available for preserving the petitioner’s right to have his appeal from denial
    of habeas corpus mean anything. Brewster v. Bradley, 379 S.W.2d 480, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 249 (Ky. 1964).

   <p class="p8">
    Kentucky courts will not assume jurisdiction to determine
    whether another state has forfeited its right to enforce its laws against
    a petitioner for habeas corpus and a Kentucky parolee arrested on a felony
    charge in Michigan and returned to Kentucky would be returned to Michigan
    upon requisition of the governor of Michigan demanding extradition. Brewster v. Luby, 380 S.W.2d 261, 1964 Ky. LEXIS 305 (Ky. 1964).
