<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">In counties of less than 200,000 population, when it will be conducive to the public health, convenience or welfare or when it will be of public benefit or utility, a levee district may be created in accordance with the procedures of KRS 65.182. KRS 266.010 to 266.180 apply only to levees that have or may receive government aid. All levee districts established prior to 1914 and now existing under the laws of Kentucky are vested with all the powers and rights conferred by KRS 266.010 to 266.180 and are not deprived of any rights previously acquired.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> The viewers shall meet on the day named in the notice provided by KRS 267.150, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and proceed with their work, for which the clerk shall furnish them with the duplicate plan of drainage adopted by the board. As soon after their first meeting as possible, the viewers shall examine the land in the district; the railroad property in the district; all other improvements, highways and bridges that may be affected by the proposed improvement; and all ditches, drains, ponds, lakes, creeks and watercourses in the district, or that are partly within and partly without the district. A majority of the viewers shall control and decide all questions.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> The viewers shall classify the land in the district with reference to the benefit it will receive from the improvement. In the case of drainage, the degree of wetness of the land, its proximity to the ditch or a natural outlet and the fertility of the soil shall be considered in determining the amount of benefit it will receive by the construction of the ditch. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the land benefited shall be separated into five classes. The land receiving the highest benefit shall be marked “Class A”; that receiving the next highest, “Class B”; that receiving the next highest, “Class C”; that receiving the next highest, “Class D”; and that receiving the smallest benefit, “Class E.” The holding of any one landowner need not be all in one class, but the number of acres in each class shall be ascertained, though its boundary need not be separately marked on the ground nor shown on the map. The total number of acres owned by one (1) person in each class and the total number of acres benefited shall be determined. The total number of acres of each class in the entire district shall be determined and presented in tabulated form. The scale of assessment to be made by the board upon the several classes of land returned by the viewers shall be in the ratio of five (5), four (4), three (3), two (2) and one (1). Whenever five (5) mills per acre are assessed against the land in “Class A,” four (4) mills per acre shall be assessed against the land in “Class B,” three (3) mills per acre in “Class C,” two (2) mills per acre in “Class D,” and one (1) mill per acre in “Class E.” This shall form the basis of the assessment of benefits to the land for drainage purposes, and in calculating the assessment against each landowner the board shall follow the classification.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> If the viewers believe that existing conditions would cause substantial injustice to any landowner by strict conformity to the five-class rule, the classification may be changed by diminishing or increasing the number of classes to conform to such conditions, or the viewers may report the benefits they estimate will accrue to each tract of land without dividing the land into classes. If the classification is changed the viewers shall indicate to the board the ratio of assessment for such changed classification as compared with the five-class rule.</p>

If the work is delayed by any good cause and the report is not completed at the time fixed by the court, the viewers shall appear before the court and state in writing the cause of such failure and ask for sufficient time to complete the work, whereupon the court shall set another date by which the report shall be completed and filed. The viewers shall not modify the adopted plan for drainage. The report shall contain a statement of the estimated cost of the works and improvements to be made in the district, a description of all the land in said district and the names of the owners thereof, and a general description of all the railroad rights-of-way, roadbeds and depot grounds, and the name of the corporation to which they belong at the date of the decree of the court organizing the district.

The vote shall be taken by the owners filing a written designation of choice, together with the number of acres the voter owns in the district, or if benefits have been confirmed the amount of benefits assessed against the owner’s land, with the county judge/executive. Each acre owned and assessed in the district shall count one (1) vote, or if benefits have been confirmed each one hundred dollars ($100) or fraction thereof in benefits assessed against the voter’s land shall count one (1) vote for secretary and drainage commissioner. The votes of the owners, when cast and filed with the county judge/executive, shall be recorded by the secretary of the board in the drainage record immediately after the expiration of the time for casting the vote.

One (1) month after the advertised election is completed, or on the first Monday in May if not an advertised election, the elected officers shall take charge of the drainage record and all records, maps, papers and property belonging to the district, except money in the hands of the treasurer.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> No one except an owner of land in the precinct for which he acts shall be eligible for drainage commissioner. Each commissioner shall be a freeholder and over twenty-one (21) years of age. The board shall have control of all improvements in the district, except as otherwise provided. Vacancies in the office of board member or secretary shall be filled by a special election after due advertising. Each drainage commissioner when elected shall execute bond for the faithful performance of his duties in the sum of $2,500 and shall be sworn to perform the duties of his office to the best of his ability.</p>

The bonds shall be in denominations of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), bearing interest payable at least annually from the date of issue, to mature at annual or more frequent intervals within thirty (30) years, commencing after a period of years not later than five (5) years, to be determined by the board. Both principal and interest shall be payable at some convenient bank or trust company’s office, to be named in the bonds. The bonds shall be signed by the president of the board, attested with the seal of the board, and the signature of the secretary and countersigned by the county clerk of the county in which the district is organized. All bonds shall be executed and delivered to the treasurer of the district, who shall sell them in quantities and at dates as the board considers necessary.

This sum shall be preserved in a separate fund for that purpose. All bonds and coupons not paid at maturity shall bear interest from maturity until paid, or until sufficient funds for their payment have been deposited at the place of payment, and this interest shall be appropriated by the board out of the penalties and interest collected on assessments or any other available funds of the district. The board, in making the annual levy of assessments, shall take into account the maturing bonds and interest on all bonds and make ample provisions in advance for their payment. If the proceeds of the original levy of assessments are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest of all bonds issued, the board shall make any additional levy upon benefits assessed necessary for this purpose. However, no levy of assessments shall be made in excess of the benefits to the property as shown by the report of the appraisers, as corrected, that will in any manner impair the security of bonds or the fund available for the payment of the principal or interest.</p>

This bond shall remain in the custody of the president of the board, who shall produce it for inspection or as evidence whenever legally required to do so. The bond of the treasurer may, if the board directs, be signed by a surety or bonding company, which may be approved by the board.
