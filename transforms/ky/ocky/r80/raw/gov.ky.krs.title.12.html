<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9">The General Assembly hereby recognizes that certain streams of Kentucky possess outstanding and unique scenic, recreational, geological, fish and wildlife, botanical, historical, archaeological and other scientific, aesthetic, and cultural values. It is the policy of the General Assembly to complement dam construction and development projects on Kentucky watercourses with other equally important and beneficial uses of our water resources. Therefore, it is hereby declared that in order to afford the citizens of the Commonwealth an opportunity to enjoy natural streams, to attract out-of-state visitors, to assure the well-being of our tourist industry, to preserve for future generations the beauty of certain areas untrammeled by man, it is in the interest of the Commonwealth to preserve some streams or portions thereof in their free-flowing condition because their natural, scenic, scientific, and aesthetic values outweigh their value for water development and control purposes now and in the future. For aesthetic, as well as ecological reasons, the foremost priority shall be to preserve the unique primitive character of those streams in Kentucky which still retain a large portion of their natural and scenic beauty, and to prevent future infringement on that beauty by impoundments or other man-made works. Since the stream areas are to be maintained in a natural state, they will also serve as areas for the perpetuation of Kentucky’s wild fauna and flora. Few such streams remain in the Eastern portion of the United States, and the General Assembly feels a strong obligation to the people of Kentucky to preserve these remnants of their proud heritage. It is the purpose of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to establish a Wild Rivers System by designating certain streams for immediate inclusion in the system and by prescribing the procedures and criteria for protecting and administering the system. It is not the intent of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to require or to authorize acquisition of all lands or interests in lands within the boundaries of the stream areas but to assure preservation of the scenic, ecological and other values and to provide proper management of the recreational, wildlife, water and other resources. It is the intent of KRS 146.200 to 146.360 to impose reasonable regulations as to the use of private and public land within the authorized boundaries of wild rivers for the general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, and where necessary, to enable the department to acquire easements or lesser interests in or fee title to lands within the authorized boundaries of the wild rivers, so that the public trust in these unique natural rivers might be kept.</p>

<p class="p9">Streams which substantially meet the following criteria are eligible for inclusion in the Wild Rivers System: Streams or sections of streams that are essentially free-flowing, with shorelines and scenic vistas essentially primitive and unchanged, free from evidence of the works of man, and pleasing to the eye. The waters shall not be polluted beyond feasible correction and shall be kept unpolluted once corrected according to standards established by the Energy and Environment Cabinet through the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves. The area may provide a high quality fish and wildlife habitat, containing one or more unique or rare species for sport or observation. It may provide opportunities for scientific study or appreciation of essentially undisturbed ecological, geologic, or archaeologic conditions. It shall provide wilderness type recreation such as canoeing and hiking, or specialized uses without disturbing the primitive character of the area.</p>

Utility lines or pipelines may be constructed as approved by the office in writing and under provision that the affected land be restored as nearly as possible to its former state.

The order shall be entered immediately upon the filing of the petition and the execution of a bond without surety by the Commonwealth in an amount satisfactory to the court to indemnify the landowner against loss of profits from any wrongful restraint of the use of his property during the period from the filing of the petition until such time as the matter is concluded by the courts.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> All areas within the borders of the Commonwealth, except those which are expressly dedicated by law for preservation and protection in their natural condition, are subject to alteration by human activity. As part of the continuing growth of the population and the economic development of the Commonwealth, it is necessary and desirable that the overall impact on the natural ecology be considered when major alterations are proposed affecting same, and that certain areas of unusual natural significance be set aside and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations. Such unique areas are valuable as laboratories for scientific research, as reservoirs of natural materials not all of the uses of which are now known, as habitats for plant and animal species and biotic communities, as living museums of the native landscape where people may observe nature’s web of life and our natural heritage, as places of historic and natural interest and scenic beauty, and as reminders of the vital human dependence upon fresh air, clean water, and unspoiled natural areas.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> It is therefore the public policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to secure for the people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of natural areas by establishing a system of nature preserves, protecting these areas and gathering and disseminating information regarding them, establishing and maintaining a registry of natural areas, and otherwise encouraging and assisting in the preservation of natural areas and features.</p>

Therefore, it is hereby declared that in order to afford the citizens of the Commonwealth an opportunity to enjoy this natural area, to attract out-of-state visitors, to ensure the well-being of our tourism industry, to preserve for future generations the beauty of certain areas untrammeled by man, to provide for the ever-increasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding population, and to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the outdoor areas and historic resources of the Commonwealth, there is hereby established a certain defined area in the southeastern part of the Commonwealth for ultimate designation as the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail, with land in the defined area owned or leased by the Commonwealth or on which the Commonwealth has obtained an easement comprising the initial state park.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> It is the intent of KRS 148.870 to 148.892 to assure preservation of the scenic, ecological, and other values within the boundaries of the trail and to provide proper management of the recreational, wildlife, water, and other resources within those boundaries. It is further the intent of KRS 148.870 to 148.892 to impose reasonable policies governing the use of land within the authorized boundaries of the trail, except for the restrictions set forth in KRS 148.870 to 148.892, for the general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth and, where necessary, to enable the Commonwealth or any of its agencies to acquire fee title or lesser interests in land within the boundaries of the trail, in order to maintain the public trust in this unique area.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The General Assembly recognizes the valuable contributions that volunteers and private, nonprofit groups have made to the development and maintenance of trails throughout the Commonwealth. In recognition of these contributions, it is further the purpose of KRS 148.870 to 148.892 to encourage and assist volunteer citizen and nonprofit group involvement in the planning, development, maintenance, and management, where appropriate, of the trail.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The General Assembly recognizes that the establishment of Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail is not intended to create a one hundred twenty (120) mile linear barrier around southeastern Kentucky. The General Assembly further recognizes that to ensure the continued economic development of the area, provisions shall be made for means of ingress and egress for owners of property and those with property rights affected by the creation of the trail, and for new road construction, utility facilities, and pipelines that may cross the trail.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> There is hereby designated a linear state park, the boundaries of which shall be determined by the department in accordance with this section known as the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail, a trail of approximately one hundred twenty (120) miles in length, located exclusively within the boundaries of Kentucky beginning along the border of Kentucky and Virginia at or near Breaks Interstate Park, and extending generally south-southwest along the crest of Pine Mountain to the vicinity of Pine Mountain State Resort Park and continuing south to the Cumberland Gap National Park on the vicinity thereof. Insofar as practicable, the boundaries of the trail from the Breaks Interstate Park to Bad Branch State Nature Preserve shall be a one thousand (1,000) foot corridor, the center of which shall be the crest of Pine Mountain, to the extent that the corridor does not encroach upon the territory of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Insofar as practicable, the boundaries of the trail from the Bad Branch State Nature Preserve to the Pine Mountain State Resort Park shall be a corridor one hundred (100) to two hundred fifty (250) feet along the level top of Pine Mountain. The route of the trail from Pine Mountain State Resort Park to Cumberland Gap National Park shall be a corridor no wider than two hundred fifty (250) feet to be determined by the department. Notwithstanding these boundary limitations, the department may through negotiations with the land owner acquire additional land outside the boundary limitations. The trail shall be depicted on the “Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail Map,” which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the commissioner of the department. The trail map shall delineate those portions of the trail that are owned or leased by the Commonwealth or on which the Commonwealth has obtained an easement and shall be updated periodically solely for the purpose of reflecting additions to those specific areas.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The department may designate connecting or side paths which shall provide additional points of public access to the trail or access to points of interest, and which shall be of the same scenic nature as the trail, except that connecting or side paths shall not be acquired through eminent domain.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Because of its extended length, the department may supplement the trail by support facilities located on certain designated parts of the trail or outside the trail. These support facilities may include, as the department deems necessary and feasible, primitive shelters, fireplaces, safe water supplies, and other related public-use facilities that shall meet department standards. No open wood fires shall be permitted on the trail except in areas with support facilities specifically designated for that purpose.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The trail shall be a state scenic trail, so chosen because of its unique location. It shall be limited to foot use and other nonmotorized uses as permitted on segments where deemed appropriate by the department, and as set forth in KRS 148.878.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The department shall, no later than June 30, 2003, determine the boundaries of the trail. In determining the boundaries of the trail the department shall not encroach upon any privately owned dwelling, or areas designated for residential structures and their surrounding properties, but shall route the trail around a privately owned dwelling or areas designated for a residential structure.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> The department shall not acquire through eminent domain any cemetery or its surrounding property which is designated as a cemetery or burial ground on July 15, 2002.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE II.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p9">This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two or more of the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, which are contiguous have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE III.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p9">In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that state and shall consult with like officials of the other member states and shall implement cooperation between such states in forest fire prevention and control.</p>
<p class="p9">The compact administrators of the member states shall coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.</p>
<p class="p9">There shall be established an advisory committee of legislators, forestry commission representatives, and forestry or forest products industries representatives which shall meet from time to time with the compact administrators.

<p class="p9">All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.</p>
<p class="p9">Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and subsistence of employees and maintenance of equipment incurred in connection with such request: provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such service to the receiving member state without charge or cost.</p>
<p class="p9">Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.</p>
<p class="p9">For the purposes of this compact the term employee shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.</p>
<p class="p9">The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE VI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p class="p9">Nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between any federal agency and a member state or states.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (2) of this section is applicable to nonresidents. OAG 62-334.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motel guest is not a “tenant” as the term is defined in subsection (30) (now subsection (38)) of KRS 150.010 and consequently is not within the exception of subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section and must have state fishing license in order to fish in a small lake located on motel property which has been stocked by the motel owner at his own expense. OAG 62-568.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no provision permitting a child under 16 to hunt without a license but he may obtain a junior hunting license pursuant to KRS 150.175(12) (now KRS 150.175(8)). OAG 62-1053.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was proper for conservation officers to arrest a man who was hunting on his father-in-law’s farm without a license and who was a resident of another county. OAG 63-14.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only the owner, his wife and children who actually reside on the farm may hunt thereon without a license. OAG 63-14.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person engaged in hunting red fox with dogs for sport and not to kill is required to have the hunting license provided for by KRS 150.175(11) (now KRS 150.175(7)). OAG 63-603.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 150.370(2) does not provide an exception to the requirement of license in order to engage in hunting foxes with dogs. OAG 63-603.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A license is required of each person engaging in hunting red fox with dogs for sport and not to kill even though no gun is carried and the fox is not harmed. OAG 63-603.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A resident of Kentucky who is 65 years of age or older may, without a statewide hunting license, engage in hunting deer, but such person must obtain a deer hunting permit required by KRS 150.175(r) (see now game license under 150.175(17)). OAG 64-15.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The department of fish and wildlife may, in its discretion, provide that those persons under 16 or over 65 years of age and landlords and tenants actually residing on the land may be exempted from a regulation providing for the purchase of a trout stamp. OAG 71-142.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Deer tags and trout stamps are “sport hunting or sport fishing licenses” for the purposes of subsections (3), (5) and (6) of this section. OAG 72-774.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A farm tenant, though he works and farms more than one farm of his landlord, is permitted to hunt and fish only upon the land on which he actually lives and may not hunt and fish on any other farmland owned by his landlord without obtaining a license. OAG 75-119.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A resident owner of farmlands, to qualify for the exemption in subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section, must actually reside on the farmlands in question. OAG 79-127.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because Illinois limits the number of deer hunting permits issued to nonresident hunters, Kentucky should not issue permits to Illinois hunters. OAG 80-600.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 150.175(1)(q), (s), and (w) (now (17), (19), and (20)), by their plain meaning alone would render untenable any position that would hold the taking of trout, waterfowl or big game as activities included within those allowed by the holders of only the sport fishing and sport hunting licenses. OAG 90-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The exemptions to the normal license requirements found at subsections (5) through (8) of this section make it permissible for the classes of persons therein named to perform all acts permitted by a sport fishing or sport hunting license without purchasing same, but those permitted acts do not include taking or pursuing deer, bear or wild turkey (for which they must purchase a big game permit); taking trout (for which they must purchase a trout stamp); or, taking or pursuing migratory waterfowl (for which they must purchase a Kentucky waterfowl stamp); in addition to the above, all other legal requirements, including the purchase of any other normally required permits, stamps or tags, must be fulfilled to do any of these acts, with the only exception being that residents of the Commonwealth who are 65 years of age or older are not required to purchase a Kentucky waterfowl stamp. OAG 90-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory language in subsections (5) through (8) of this section makes it consistently clear that in each case the extent of the exemption reaches only so far as to cover those acts authorized by the licenses (sport hunting or sport fishing). OAG 90-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a distinction between a hunting license and a permit, as the license authorizes the hunter to take or pursue all permissible wild animals, while in order to hunt deer, the hunter must also have a permit, and OAGs 71-142 and 72-774, insofar as they have become inconsistent with subsequent statutory amendment regarding exemptions for hunters, are hereby withdrawn. OAG 90-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The exception in former subsection (8) of this section cannot be applied to one declared totally and permanently disabled under the Federal Railroad Retirement System. OAG 91-142.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislative intent behind former subsection (8) of this section, as well as its effect, is to exempt from the otherwise required sport hunting and sport fishing licenses those persons who are either: 1) declared to be totally and permanently disabled by the state Workers’ Compensation Board; or 2) declared to be disabled by the Social Security Administration.

The redemption of receipts shall be paid only from funds especially appropriated for this purpose and it is expressly provided that no bounty shall be paid from any regular receipts, funds, or appropriations of the department. However, the department may charge a maximum of one dollar ($1) against the appropriation for bounties for each bounty paid as reimbursement for the expense of administering the bounty program.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1) (a)</b> The conservation, development, and proper use of the water resources of the Commonwealth of Kentucky have become of vital importance as a result of population expansion and concentration, industrial growth, technological advances, and an ever increasing demand for water for varied domestic, agricultural, industrial, municipal, and recreational uses. It is recognized by the General Assembly that excessive rainfall during certain seasons of the year causes damage from overflowing streams. However, prolonged droughts at other seasons curtail industrial, municipal, agricultural, and recreational uses of water and seriously threaten the continued growth and economic well-being of the Commonwealth. The advancement of the safety, happiness, and welfare of the people and the protection of property require that the power inherent in the people be utilized to promote and to regulate the conservation, development, and most beneficial use of the water resources. It is hereby declared that the general welfare requires that the water resources of the Commonwealth be put to the beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, that the waste or nonbeneficial use of water be prevented, and that the conservation and beneficial use of water be exercised in the interest of the people. Therefore, it is declared the policy of the Commonwealth to actively encourage and to provide financial, technical, or other support for projects that will control and store our water resources in order that the continued growth and development of the Commonwealth might be assured. To that end, it is declared to be the purpose of KRS Chapters 146, 149, 151, 224, 262, and KRS 350.029 and 433.750 to 433.757 for the Commonwealth to permit, regulate, and participate in the construction or financing of facilities to store surplus surface water for future use; to conserve and develop the ground water resources of the Commonwealth; to require local communities to develop long range water supply plans; to protect the rights of all persons equitably and reasonably interested in the use and availability of water; to prohibit the pollution of water resources and to maintain the normal flow of all streams so that the proper quantity and quality of water will be available at all times to the people of the Commonwealth; to provide for the adequate disposition of water among the people of the Commonwealth entitled to its use during severe droughts or times of emergency; to prevent harmful overflows and flooding; to regulate the construction, maintenance, and operation of all dams and other barriers of streams; to prevent the obstruction of streams and floodways by the dumping of substances therein; to keep accurate records on the amount of water withdrawal from streams and watercourses and reasonably regulate the amount of withdrawal of public water; and to engage in other activities as may be necessary to conserve and develop the water resources of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and to ensure adequate supply of water for domestic, agricultural, recreational, and economic development uses.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> It is a finding of the General Assembly that groundwater is an important but vulnerable natural resource of this state, that the majority of rural Kentuckians rely exclusively on groundwater for drinking, and that groundwater is inextricably linked to surface waters which may also serve as a drinking water resource. It is also a finding that groundwater is a resource equally vital for agricultural, commercial, and industrial purposes and that useable groundwater is critical to the future development of these industries. Therefore, it shall be the policy of this state to manage groundwater for the health, welfare, and economic prosperity of all citizens.</p>

The authority is not empowered to levy charges on the use of any public water not directly associated with the operation of a water resource project which the authority has undertaken or in which it has an interest.

<p class="p9">The General Assembly finds that groundwater makes up over ninety-five percent (95%) of the water resources in Kentucky. Groundwater accounts for over thirty percent (30%) of the public and domestic water supplies in the Commonwealth, and up to ninety percent (90%) of all rural domestic supplies, and is the major source of water to streams. It is imperative that a system for characterizing and monitoring groundwater be developed so that information acquired through various monitoring programs will allow Kentucky to identify and characterize the groundwater resource. The information from the monitoring network can be used to enhance the Kentucky Groundwater Data Repository; identify, characterize, and model groundwater systems; develop community and private water supplies; address resource allocation concerns; set boundaries on wellhead protection areas; recognize groundwater degradation if it occurs; and evaluate and improve the quality and quantity of data collected through all programs.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The West Fork Drakes Creek Dam and Reservoir Interstate Authority is hereby created. The West Fork Drakes Creek Dam and Reservoir Interstate Authority shall be a public body corporate and politic and shall be referred to as the “authority” in KRS 151.650 to 151.664. The authority shall develop the resources of the region embracing the Tennessee county of Sumner and the Kentucky county of Simpson by means of the construction and maintenance of a dam across the West Fork Drakes Creek and the reservoir created by this dam. The water impounded within this reservoir shall be utilized by the areas encompassing the authority to provide a source of water for both recreation and economic development to be used in industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential activities. The authority may develop this dam and reservoir for these stated purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The General Assembly hereby finds that the need for the purposes for which this authority is created is evidenced by the effects which the recent droughts have had and continue to have on this area.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The authority may issue its bonds from time to time for the purpose of paying in whole or in part the cost of acquiring lands and interests therein and of constructing facilities and improvements subject to the limitations and conditions provided in KRS 151.650 to 151.664. Any resolution of the board authorizing the sale of bonds shall be submitted to the state funding board established by Tennessee statute and shall become effective only upon approval by that board. If the board refuses approval, it shall state in writing the reasons for the action.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, all bonds issued by the authority shall be payable solely out of the revenues and receipts derived from the authority’s projects or of any as may be designated in the proceeding of the board under which the bonds are authorized to be issued, including debt obligations of the lessee or contracting party obtained from or in connection with the financing of a project. Notes issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds may be retired out of the proceeds of the bonds. The bonds may be executed and delivered by the authority at any time and from time to time, may be in the form and denominations and of the terms and maturities, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in the installments and at the time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at the place or places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at the rate or rates payable at the time or times and at the place or places and evidenced in the manner, may be executed by the officers of the authority, and may contain the provisions not inconsistent herewith, as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board under which the bonds are authorized to be issued. If deemed advisable by the board, there may be retained in the proceedings under which any bonds of the authority are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as specified in the proceedings, at the price or prices and after the notice or notices and on the terms and conditions as set forth in the proceedings, and as briefly recited on the face of the bonds, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the authority any right or option to redeem any bonds except as provided in the proceedings under which they are issued. Any bonds of the authority may be sold at public or private sale in the manner, at the price, and from time to time, as determined by the board to be most advantageous, and the authority may pay all expenses, premiums, and commissions which its board deems necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by the board of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Proceeds of bonds issued by the authority may be used for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, reconstructing, improving, equipping, furnishing, bettering, or extending any project or projects as authorized by KRS 151.650 to 151.664, including the payment of interest on the bonds during construction of any project and for two (2) years after the estimated date of completion, and payment of engineering, fiscal, architectural, and legal expenses incurred in connection with the project and the issuance of the bonds and the establishment of a reasonable reserve fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds in the event of a deficiency in the revenues and receipts available for the payment.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Any bonds or notes of the authority at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in the amount the board deems necessary, but not exceeding the sum of the following:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Unpaid interest on the obligations to the date of delivery or exchange of the refunding bonds.</p>
<p class="p9">If the proceeds from the sale of the refunding bonds are to be deposited in trust, interest shall accrue on obligations from the date of delivery to the first or any subsequent available redemption date or dates selected, in its discretion, by the board or to the date or dates of maturity, whichever shall be determined by the board to be most advantageous or necessary to the authority;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> A reasonable reserve for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds and a renewal and replacement reserve;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> Expenses, premiums, and commissions of the authority, including bond discounts, deemed by the board to be necessary for the issuance of the refunding bonds.

<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Any refund may be made whether the obligations to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the obligations to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the obligations so to be refunded, or by sale of the refunding bonds and the applications of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the obligations to be refunded thereby, and regardless of whether or not the obligations proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Prior to issuance of the refunding bonds, the board shall cause notice of its intention to issue the refunding bonds, identifying the obligations proposed to be refunded and setting forth the estimated date of delivery of the refunding bonds, to be given to the holders of the refunding bonds, to be given to the holders of the outstanding obligations by publication of an appropriate notice one (1) time each in a newspaper having general circulation in the area and in a financial newspaper published in New York, New York, and having national circulation. As soon as practicable after the delivery of the refunding bonds, and whether or not any of the obligations to be refunded are to be called for redemption, the board shall cause notice of the issuance of the refunding bonds to be given in the manner provided in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If any of the obligations to be refunded are to be called for redemption, the board shall cause notice of redemption to be given in the manner required by the proceedings authorizing the outstanding obligations.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> The principal proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> To the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded; or</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> To the extent not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded, the proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with the refunding, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any surplus, including without limitation, provision for the pledging of any surplus to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series of refunding bonds. Money in any trust fund may be invested in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed, by the United States government, or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, or in certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of Kentucky if the certificates shall be secured by a pledge of any obligations having any aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable, shall not have been called for redemption.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> All bonds, refunding bonds, and the interest coupons applicable thereto shall be construed to be negotiable instruments.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> The principal of and interest on any bonds issued by the authority may be secured by a pledge of the revenues and receipts out of which the same shall be made payable, and may be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of the projects from which the revenues or receipts so pledged may be derived, including any enlargements of and additions to any projects thereafter made, or by an assignment and pledge of all or any part of the authority’s interest in and rights under the leases, sale contracts, or loan agreements relating to the projects, or any thereof. The resolution under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any mortgage or deed of trust may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to any projects or portions thereof covered by the resolution, mortgage, or deed of trust, the creation and maintenance of special funds from the revenues and from proceeds of the bonds, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, as the board shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions of KRS 151.650 to 151.664. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage, and deed of trust made for the benefit of security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The authority is hereby authorized to provide, at one (1) time or from time to time, for the issuance of its revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one (1) or more projects undertaken pursuant to KRS 151.720. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall in each instance be payable solely from a special fund provided for the payment, with revenues derived from water use fees collected from all facilities using water from the Kentucky River basin, except those facilities using water primarily for agricultural purposes, pledged to be set aside and deposited in such special fund. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more such series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding the thirtieth anniversary of their respective dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of bonds including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be affixed thereto and attested by the manual signature of the treasurer of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall have and are hereby declared to have all qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell such bonds at public sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of KRS 151.720.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such a manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for such bonds or any account or accounts therein as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing such bonds.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The authority may issue revenue bond anticipation notes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Any holder of bonds issued under the provisions of this section or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust indenture, except to the extent of the rights given in this section, may be restricted by such trust indenture or proceedings, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the Commonwealth or granted under this section or under such trust indenture or the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such trust indenture or proceedings to be performed by the authority or by any officer or employee thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall not be a debt, liability, or obligation of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof and shall not be a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Revenue bonds issued by the authority shall be subject to the jurisdiction and approval of the State Property and Buildings Commission and the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee and shall be subject to review by the Office of Financial Management established in KRS 42.0201.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> The authority shall not be required to pay any taxes and assessments to the Commonwealth or any county, municipality, or other governmental subdivision of the Commonwealth upon any of its property or upon its obligations or other evidences of indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this section, or upon any moneys, funds, revenues, or other income held or received by the authority and the bonds or notes of the authority and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation, except for death and gift taxes and taxes of transfers.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> Contractual expenses to construct, reconstruct, provide for the major maintenance, or repair the Kentucky River locks and dams, or to maintain the channel, or to acquire real or personal property pertaining thereto, or to construct, reconstruct, maintain, or repair such property, shall be paid from the proceeds of the revenue bonds. Expenses for administrative services and necessary travel expenses and per diem compensation of authority members, shall not be paid from the proceeds of the revenue bonds. Nor shall the cabinet’s cost of operating the locks be paid from the proceeds of the revenue bonds.</p>

Enact. Acts 1960, ch. 113, § 2.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9">The party states recognize that the proper employment of nuclear energy, facilities, materials, and products can assist substantially in the industrialization of the south and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from the acquisition of nuclear resources and facilities requires systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the south and contribute to the individual and community well being of the region’s people.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE II. THE BOARD.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the “Southern Interstate Nuclear Board” (hereinafter called the board). The board shall be composed of one member from each party state designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law. Any member of the board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon (either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provision therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(b)</b> The board members of the party states shall each be entitled to one vote on the board. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(c)</b> The board shall have a seal.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(d)</b> The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, and a treasurer. The board shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in such amounts as the board may require.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(e)</b> The executive director, with the approval of the board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the board’s functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(f)</b> The board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(g)</b> The board may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.</p>

The board shall publish its bylaws, rules and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof, and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(k)</b> The board annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state, a report covering the activities of the board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the board.

<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE III. FINANCES.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>(a)</b> The board shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(b)</b> Each of the board’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. One-half of the total amount of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned among the party states in equal shares; one-quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on the last decennial federal census; and one-quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the latest computations published by the federal census-taking agency. Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the board.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(c)</b> The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II(h) of this compact, provided that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9">The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment, can assist substantially in the industrialization of the south and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from the acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the south and contribute to the individual and community well being of the region’s people.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE II. THE BOARD.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>(c)</b> The board shall have a seal.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(d)</b> The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, and a treasurer.

One-half of the total amount of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned among the party states in equal shares; one-quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on the last decennial federal census; and one-quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the latest computations published by the federal census-taking agency.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9">The General Assembly finds and determines that:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The United States currently imports almost sixty percent (60%) of its petroleum needs, and nearly half of these imports come from highly unstable regions and countries. It is projected that this percentage will grow to over seventy percent (70%) by 2025 unless the United States changes its policy on producing liquid fuels;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Events in the Middle East, Africa, and South America, coupled with China’s efforts to secure world oil reserves and production facilities, demonstrate that increasing reliance on foreign sources of petroleum threatens the homeland security of the United States. America’s military is increasingly looking at the potential of alternate liquid fuels produced from fossil energy resources or agricultural materials as a reliable, secure source of fuel;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Petroleum imports are the single largest cause of the nation’s negative balance of trade with the rest of the world and are a major cause of inflation and economic slowdown;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Experts project that world oil prices will remain very high because production is at or near its peak while world demand for oil is increasing rapidly. This increase in demand is due largely to economic growth in developing nations, especially China, where oil demand grew by twenty percent (20%) in 2004 and is expected to grow by a similar amount in 2005;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The price of crude oil is the major factor driving up prices for gasoline, as well as for oil used for home heating in addition to commercial and industrial purposes. Natural gas for home heating and other purposes has been driven to record-high prices as a result of supply constriction and increased demand from the industrial sector;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Technologies have long existed for producing transportation fuels from indigenous fossil and biomass energy resources in the United States, and research has demonstrated that coal-based alternate fuel technologies are cost-effective when the world price of petroleum exceeds thirty-five dollars ($35) per barrel;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> The United States has trillions of tons of indigenous fossil energy resources and agricultural capacity that rival total worldwide conventional oil reserves. These domestic resources are capable of producing alternate transportation fuels sufficient to make the United States independent of foreign petroleum imports. Kentucky has hundreds of years of fossil energy resources, and the Commonwealth’s agriculture produces substantial biomass materials for production of premium-quality liquid transportation fuels;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> The development of an alternate transportation fuels industry in the United States will create long-term reliable demand for Kentucky’s energy and agricultural resources, stabilizing both the energy industries and the agriculture community;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> Coal-based alternate transportation fuel technologies are capable of producing environmentally superior transportation fuels from near-zero-emission plants with removal or capture of virtually all pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide, and from biomass-based technologies that are very environmentally positive. The United States can set an example for the world by implementing these technologies, and Kentucky is poised to lead the way;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> Coal-based technologies in the United States are capable of producing pipeline-quality natural gas and industrial-quality natural gas at prices which are below current annual market prices for natural gas;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(11)</b> Kentucky’s universities have for several decades been among the leading entities in the United States doing research on transportation fuels from coal and oil shale. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture has provided support relating to development of transportation fuels from Kentucky agricultural materials;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(12)</b> Although developing an alternate fuels industry capable of reducing America’s dependence on foreign sources of petroleum requires the large-scale financial and technical resources of the federal government and private industry, only government and industry in the states can ensure the most efficient and productive on-site joining of technologies, energy resources, and industrial and transportation infrastructure;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(13)</b> The economic, national security, and environmental advantages of establishing thriving domestic alternative liquid fuels and synthetic natural gas industries vastly outweigh the development costs. In contrast, doing little or nothing subjects America to continued and repeated energy supply disruptions and to potentially severe economic consequences;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(14)</b> Embarking on a national mission to achieve energy security and move toward liquid and synthetic fuels independence will not only reduce risk and lower oil prices, natural gas prices, and oil price volatility, it will also facilitate an industrial rebirth, create jobs, foster new technology, and enhance economic growth; and</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(15)</b> Kentucky, through its universities, has done the research and testing of these environmentally responsible alternative liquid fuel technologies. Kentucky has the natural resources to be the leader in achieving energy security and independence for the United States.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> It is the finding of the General Assembly that cultural opportunities and the arts have a direct and positive impact on the hotel industry through promotion of tourism and convention trade. The Kentucky Center for the Arts will serve as catalyst in the development of Louisville and Jefferson County as a major convention and entertainment center. The Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation will have as management priority the stimulation of the Jefferson County hotel industry and promotion of tourism through:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The presentation of Kentucky and Louisville-area and nationally and internationally prominent arts activities which will attract regional audiences;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Regional and national promotion of events occurring within the Commonwealth, along with ancillary services and activities;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> The development, in conjunction with local hotels and the arts and entertainment industry, of tourist packages including performance and group plans;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> The active solicitation of arts related conferences and conventions;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> The active participation with local hotels and convention bureaus in attracting non-arts related conferences and conventions, with the center serving as an important amenity;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> The development of a Kentucky folklore program which will attract participants and an audience from throughout the state;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(g)</b> The contribution to cultural diversity and the attractiveness of Louisville and Jefferson County as a year-round tourist and entertainment attraction.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> For these reasons, the General Assembly concludes that the dedication of additional revenues from the increased transient room tax authorized in counties containing first class cities to the Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation will directly benefit the Jefferson County hotel industry, and that this dedication symbolizes the integral relationship between the Kentucky center and promotion of the Jefferson County hotel industry, created by KRS 153.400 to 153.460.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the board is authorized to exercise the following power:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The board may provide for the issuance of economic development revenue bonds by the cabinet, for the purpose of providing funds and moneys to enable the cabinet to exercise and fulfill the powers and authority set forth in KRS 154.10-030, to enter into agreements with governmental agencies and private companies, corporations, partnerships, and other such entities, acquire and lease projects to governmental agencies and private companies, corporations, cabinets, and other such entities, purchase obligations of governmental agencies issued for economic development projects, and make loans or grants for economic development projects, and to enable the cabinet generally to carry out and effectuate its proper purposes under this chapter. In anticipation of the issuance of the revenue bonds, the board may provide for the issuance at one (1) time, or from time to time, of revenue bond anticipation notes pursuant to the general laws of the state. The principal of and the interest on the revenue bonds or notes shall be payable solely from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes. Any such notes may be made payable from the proceeds of bonds or renewal notes, or in the event bond or renewal note proceeds are not available, or should the board deem it financially practicable to pay the notes directly from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, the notes may be paid from any revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes. Prior to the issuance of the bonds or notes, the cabinet shall submit any proposed issue to the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee for its review and determination in accordance with provisions of KRS 45.810.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The revenue bonds or notes of the cabinet shall be dated and may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the board at prices and under terms and conditions determined by the board. Any bonds or notes shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall be payable annually or at shorter intervals, and may bear conversion privileges determined by the board. Notes shall mature at the time or times not exceeding five (5) years from their date or dates, and revenue bonds shall mature at the time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates as may be determined by the board. The board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds or notes, and shall fix the denomination or denominations and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer of the board whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any revenue bonds or notes shall cease to be such officer before the delivery thereof, the signature of the facsimile shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the officer had remained in office until the delivery. At the time of issuance of variable rate revenue bonds, the board may designate individuals or institutions which, in the sole judgment of the board, have financial market expertise to serve as agent for the board for establishing and changing from time to time, while the variable rate revenue bonds remain outstanding, the rate of interest to be borne by and the price to be paid for the revenue bonds. The rate-setting procedures and authority of each agent shall be set forth in writing, and may include a formula or an index or indices based upon market factors, and shall be established by the board at the time of issuance of the revenue bonds. At the time of the issuance of the revenue bonds, the board shall establish the maximum interest rate to be borne by the revenue bonds. The board shall retain the right to remove or replace any agent at any time and for any reason. The board may provide that said bonds or notes may be executed only with the facsimile signatures of its officers, but said bonds or notes shall be executed with the manual signature of a bank or trust company designated by the board as registrar and paying agent.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> All revenue bonds or notes issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to possess all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the state. The board may sell the revenue bonds or notes in the manner, either at public or private negotiated sale, and for the price, as it may determine will best effect the purpose of this chapter. If revenue bonds are sold at public, competitive sale, the revenue bonds shall be sold after newspaper advertising conforming to the requirements of KRS Chapter 424 and competitive bids for the sale of the revenue bonds shall be opened and read publicly by the board at a designated place, day and hour, all of which shall be announced in the advertising made relative thereto.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> In its proceedings authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or notes, the board shall fix and determine contractual provisions with the bondholders relating to the receipt, allocation, pledging, and disbursement of revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, and may enact and determine terms, conditions, and restrictions pursuant to which additional revenue bonds of the cabinet may be authorized and issued from time to time. The proceedings, determinations, and enactments of the board shall specify that the payment of principal of and interest on all cabinet revenue bonds and notes shall constitute a first charge and lien against all revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes before any such revenues are used, applied, and disbursed for any other valid purposes of the cabinet, including the payment of operation and maintenance costs incident to the operation of the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> The proceeds of all revenue bonds or notes shall be used solely for the purpose of enabling the cabinet to enter into agreements or interim financing agreements with governmental agencies and private companies, corporations, partnerships, and other entities, to acquire and lease projects to governmental agencies, private companies, corporations, partnerships and other entities, to purchase obligations of governmental agencies issued for economic development projects, to make loans or grants to governmental agencies, private companies, corporations, partnerships, and other such entities for economic development projects, or for any purpose authorized in this chapter. Revenue bond or note proceeds may also be used and applied for the payment of ordinary and necessary expenses in connection with issuance of the revenue bonds or notes, including, but not by way of limitation, a sum equal to any discount in the sale thereof, if discount bids are authorized and permitted by the board, administrative expenses, including the preparation of revenue bonds or notes, publication of notices, printing and other costs, attorneys’ fees, and other ordinary and necessary costs of financing, including the payment of fees to fiscal agents for advice and assistance in the preparation and marketing of revenue bonds or notes.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive revenue bonds or notes, the board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive revenue bonds or notes when the revenue bonds or notes shall have been executed, and are available for delivery. The board shall also provide for the replacement of any revenue bonds or notes that shall have become mutilated or shall have been destroyed or lost. Revenue bonds or notes may be issued under the provisions of this chapter directly by the board without obtaining the consent or acquiescence of any cabinet, division, commission, board, department, or agency of the state other than the Finance and Administration Cabinet, and as provided in KRS 42.420, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things except as specifically required by this chapter and the provisions of the resolution or resolutions of the board authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or notes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The board shall assume all bond issuance and refunding authority, power, duties, and obligations as existed on July 14, 1992, for the Kentucky Development Finance Authority, and the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Authority; the ability of any of the foregoing organizations to issue industrial revenue bonds under KRS Chapter 103; and the ability of any of the foregoing authorities to issue economic development revenue bonds as provided in this chapter. The board shall also have the authority and power to issue revenue bonds for any other economic development activity as set forth in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The board shall for purposes of the Kentucky Revised Statutes be deemed to be the successor issuer for all of the currently issued and outstanding bond issues by the organizations set forth in subsection (2) of this section. The board shall have the authority and the power to reaffirm all existing bond obligations of the organizations in subsection (2) of this section and shall perform all duties, obligations, and requirements as may be necessary and required under the bond documents relating to each and every such issue. The board shall also, in regard to each and every such issue, exercise its authority and power as set forth in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> In the discretion of the board, any revenue bonds or notes issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the cabinet and corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. A trust indenture, or the resolution of the board providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or notes, may pledge or assign for the security of the revenue bonds or notes, all or any part of the totality of revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes received and to be received. The trust indenture or resolution of the board may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders which may be reasonable and proper, and not in violation of law, including, but not limited to, covenants and provisions setting forth the duties of the cabinet in relation to the purposes to which revenue bonds and note proceeds may be applied; the disposition or pledging of assets and revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all such revenues. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of revenue bonds, notes, or revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, to furnish such indemnifying bonds, or to pledge such securities as may be required by a trust indenture or resolution of the board. Any trust indenture or board resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders, where a trust indenture has been entered into. In addition to the foregoing, any trust indenture or board resolution may contain other provisions which the board determines to be reasonable and proper for the further security of the holders of any revenue bonds or notes. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of a trust indenture or bond proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of operating the cabinet, and may be paid from revenues pledged or assigned to the payment of the principal of and the interest on revenue bonds or notes, or from any other funds properly available to the cabinet for bond purposes. However, the payment of operational costs from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes shall, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, be subordinate to the payment of principal of and interest on cabinet revenue bonds or notes from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, it being intended that these principal and interest requirements shall be secured by a prior and paramount lien on gross revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, any trust indenture or board resolution shall provide that, except to the extent the rights afforded to bondholders by this section shall be enforceable and enforced by a trustee under a trust indenture rather than by the bondholders, any holder of revenue bonds or notes issued by the cabinet or any of the coupons appurtenant thereto, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights generally arising under the laws of the Commonwealth, or granted under this chapter, or under a trust indenture, or by the resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or notes, and may specifically enforce and compel by mandamus the performance of all duties required by this chapter, or by trust indenture, or board resolution, to be performed by the cabinet or by any officer or employee thereof, including, but not limited to, the prompt and full enforcement of the terms and conditions of all assistance agreements to which the cabinet is a party.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> The cabinet is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of refunding revenue bonds or notes for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds or notes then outstanding, whether issued by the cabinet under the provisions of this chapter or one (1) of the agencies, authorities or organizations referenced in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of these revenue bonds or notes, and, if determined advisable by the board, for the additional purpose of providing further funds for the carrying out of the proper public and governmental purposes of the cabinet. The issuance and sale of the refunding revenue bonds or notes, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the cabinet in respect of the same, shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter which relate to the issuance of revenue bonds or notes, insofar as these provisions may be applicable.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Refunding revenue bonds or notes may be sold or exchanged directly for outstanding revenue bonds or notes of the cabinet, and if sold, the proceeds thereof shall be applied, in addition to any other authorized purposes, to the purchase, redemption, or payment of these outstanding revenue bonds or notes. Pending the application of the proceeds of any refunding revenue bonds, with any other available funds, to the payment of the principal, accrued interest, and any redemption premium on the revenue bonds or notes being refunded (and if so provided or permitted in the board resolution authorizing the issuance of the refunding revenue bonds or notes, or in the trust indenture securing the same, to the payment of any interest on the refunding revenue bonds or notes and any expenses in connection with the refunding), the proceeds may be invested in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America which shall mature or which shall be subject to redemption by the holders thereof at the option of such holders not later than the respective dates when the proceeds, together with the interest accruing thereon, will be required for the purposes intended.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> Revenue bonds and notes issued by the cabinet under the provisions of this chapter are hereby declared and deemed to be securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust companies, banking associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. These obligations of the cabinet are hereby declared and determined to be securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the Commonwealth, for the purpose for which the deposit of bonds, notes, or obligations of the Commonwealth is now, or may hereafter be, authorized by law.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> Revenue bonds or notes issued by the cabinet under the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof, or a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof; but the bonds shall be payable as to principal and interest solely from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes provided therefor under the provisions of this chapter. All such revenue bonds or notes shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the Commonwealth nor the cabinet shall be obligated to pay the same, or the interest thereon, except from revenues made available to the cabinet for bond purposes, as defined in this chapter; and that neither the faith and credit, nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on such revenue bonds or notes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(10)</b> The Commonwealth, for the specific use and benefit of the cabinet, may cause to be submitted to the voters of the state in a manner provided by Sections 49 and 50 of the Constitution of Kentucky, from time to time, propositions for the incurring of state indebtedness represented by general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth, the proceeds of which are to be made available to the cabinet and used and employed by the cabinet for all proper purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(11)</b> Subject to the provisions of KRS 56.870 to 56.873, the State Property and Buildings Commission or the Kentucky Turnpike Authority may issue bonds for which debt service originates with an appropriation of the General Assembly, and may make the proceeds available to the cabinet for all proper purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(12)</b> Funds appropriated to the cabinet by the General Assembly, including but not limited to repayments of revolving funds established with appropriations of the General Assembly or established with bond issues for which the debt service, issuance costs, reserve fund requirements, insurance premiums or any other expenditures associated with bond issuance are appropriated by the General Assembly, shall not be commingled with other funds made available to the cabinet and shall only be expended for the purposes specified by the General Assembly when the appropriation is made or as approved in subsequent actions of the General Assembly.</p>

<p class="p9">The purposes of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 are to encourage capital investment in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, to encourage the establishment or expansion of small businesses in Kentucky, to provide additional jobs, and to encourage the development of new products and technologies in the state through capital investments. It is the intent of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 to give investment preference to Kentucky small businesses showing a potential for rapid growth. Insofar as possible, any investment made in a Kentucky small business under the provisions of KRS 154.20-250 to 154.20-284 shall be used by that business to leverage additional capital investments from other sources.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> If an eligible company operates an existing business in a qualified zone, and wishes to expand that business within the zone, the eligible company may submit an application to the authority to become an approved company under KRS 154.23-025.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If the eligible company under subsection (1) of this section becomes an approved company, the authority shall determine a base level of employment in the Commonwealth, a base level of state income tax liability, a base level of limited liability entity tax liability under KRS 141.0401, and a base level of manufacturing or service or technology activity, as applicable, of the approved company for determining eligible credits for the approved company’s project during the term of a tax incentive agreement or service and technology agreement. The base level shall be determined by taking into consideration any seasonal fluctuations or aberrations of employment levels during the preceding three (3) years. Notwithstanding the determination of a base level of employment in the Commonwealth, no qualified statewide employee who is an employee of this business prior to the date of the preliminary approval by the authority as prescribed in KRS 154.23-030 shall be subject to assessment.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The authority shall identify, by name, all of the existing qualified statewide employees employed by the eligible company prior to preliminary approval, and these employees shall be exempt from the assessment. If any of these employees cease working in the activity, then another qualified statewide employee shall be added to the base level of employment, based on the earliest date of entry into the workforce, and this employee shall be exempt from the assessment. The authority may negotiate with the approved company a different method of determining the base level of employment that would yield a more equitable result for the approved company, the Commonwealth, local jurisdictions, and the qualified statewide employees.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> To become eligible for inducements, the approved company shall create and maintain above the base level of employment in the Commonwealth, an increase at the site of the project of at least ten (10) new full-time qualified employees.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The approved company shall continue to pay to the Commonwealth, on an annualized basis during the term of the tax incentive agreement or service and technology agreement, as applicable, the base level of income tax, and the limited liability entity tax imposed under KRS 141.0401, adjusted on an annual basis to reflect changes in the consumer price index. The excess income tax and limited liability entity tax imposed under KRS 141.0401 owed may be offset by the income tax credit provided in KRS 154.23-050.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If any approved company expands in a qualified zone because of an increase in business or because of the commencement of a new line of business, it may be eligible, at the discretion of the authority, to negotiate a separate, additional tax incentive agreement or service and technology agreement to cover the expanded business under the same conditions as authorized for an expansion in this section.</p>

<p class="p9">The General Assembly finds and declares that the general welfare and material well-being of the citizens of the Commonwealth depends in large measure upon the revitalization and development of industry in the Commonwealth, and that it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to induce the revitalization of existing manufacturing or agribusiness facilities within the Commonwealth in order to advance the public purposes of relieving unemployment by preserving and creating jobs that would not exist if not for the inducements to be offered by the authority to approved companies, and by preserving and creating sources of tax revenues for the support of public services provided by the Commonwealth; and that the authority prescribed by KRS 154.26-015 to 154.26-100, and the purposes to be accomplished under the provisions of KRS 154.26-015 to 154.26-100 are proper governmental and public purposes for which public moneys may be expended, and that the inducement of the creation of projects is of paramount importance mandating that the provisions of KRS 154.26-015 to 154.26-100 be liberally construed and applied in order to advance public purposes.</p>

<p class="p7">(7/15/2008). 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 178, sec. 14 established a new Subchapter 30 of Chapter 154 concerning tax increment financing projects and secs. 16 through 19 and 21 of that Act repealed, reenacted, and amended existing sections of KRS Chapter 65 as new sections of the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154. Inquiry was made of the drafter as to the intent of those actions. The drafter explained that statutes dealing with both area development projects and tax increment financing projects were blended together in KRS Chapter 65 with no easy distinguishing elements, and the intent of creating Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 was to separate them appropriately. Therefore, the intent of secs. 16 through 19 and 21 was to move those sections contained in KRS Chapter 65 that relate to only tax increment financing projects into the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154, with necessary conforming amendments to the language. The Reviser of Statutes inquired about the treatment of sec. 20 of that Act purporting to amend KRS 65.7079, which appeared to the Reviser to require the same treatment as other statutes in that range moved into new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 in secs. 16 through 19 and 21. The drafter confirmed that the intent was to treat that statute in the same manner as those statutes addressed in secs. 16 through 19 and 21. As such, the Reviser of Statutes has treated sec. 20 in codification as repealing and reenacting this statute as a new section of Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 to effectuate that intent.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky finds that the forests of the Commonwealth provide abundant, renewal timber resources that historically have been underdeveloped, underutilized, and poorly managed, but which have proven to be resilient; and that, with proper planning, management, harvesting, value-added processing and manufacturing, and marketing, these resources will continue to grow in importance to the Commonwealth’s economy.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The General Assembly further finds that through proper attention and direction by the agencies of the Commonwealth and its public educational institutions working in partnership with secondary wood products businesses, the secondary wood products industry as a key industrial sector of the Commonwealth’s future economic growth and health, should prosper through the generation of new and expanding secondary wood products manufacturers by supporting improved management and harvesting practices, by developing and implementing workers’ training programs to upgrade the skills of Kentuckians employed in the wood products processing and manufacturing industry, by assisting the private sector to adapt existing manufacturing systems to new or improved technologies and world class management practices for the purposes of increasing product quality and productivity of Kentucky’s wood products manufacturers and processors and enhancing the global competitiveness of Kentucky secondary wood products industries.</p>

Sales proceeds and unused instant tickets shall be delivered to the corporation or its authorized collection representative upon demand.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (2) of this section, which prohibits the forgery of lottery tickets, was not special legislation in violation of Ky. Const., § 59; the penalty imposed by subsection (2) of this section serves a legitimate governmental interest in maintaining the integrity of the lottery. Harris v. Commonwealth, 878 S.W.2d 801, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the Kentucky constitution was amended to allow for the creation of the lottery, the General Assembly could have amended KRS 516.020 to include forgery of lottery tickets. Rather than amend the existing legislation, however, it enacted subsection (2) of this section, which addresses only the forgery of lottery tickets. As it clearly would not have been special legislation to amend KRS 154A.020 to include forgery of lottery tickets, similarly this section does not constitute special legislation. Creation of a separate statutory provision is in conformity with the constitutional amendment allowing the General Assembly to promulgate legislation regulating and protecting the integrity of the lottery.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> An annual excise tax is hereby levied on every corporation organized under this chapter for the privilege of transacting business in this Commonwealth during the calendar year, according to or measured by its entire net income, as defined herein, received or accrued from all sources during the preceding calendar year, hereinafter referred to as taxable year, at the rate of four and one-half percent (4.5%) of such entire net income. The minimum tax assessable to any one (1) such corporation shall be ten dollars ($10). The liability for the tax imposed by this section shall arise upon the first day of each calendar year, and shall be based upon and measured by the entire net income of each such corporation for the preceding calendar year, including all income received from government securities in such year. As used in this section the words “taxable year” mean the calendar year next preceding the calendar year for which and during which the excise tax is levied.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The excise tax levied under subsection (1) of this section shall be in lieu of the taxes imposed by KRS 141.040 and the taxes imposed by KRS 141.0401. It is the purpose and intent of the General Assembly to levy taxes on corporations organized pursuant to this chapter so that all such corporations will be taxed uniformly in a just and equitable manner in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The intent of this section is for the General Assembly to exercise the powers of classification and of taxation on property, franchises, and trades conferred by Section 171 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> On or before June 1 of each year, the executive officer or officers of each corporation shall file with the commissioner of the Department of Revenue a full and accurate report of all income received or accrued during the taxable year, and also an accurate record of the legal deductions in the same calendar year to the end that the correct entire net income of the corporation may be determined. This report shall be in such form and contain such information as the commissioner of the Department of Revenue may specify. At the time of making such report by each corporation, the taxes levied by this section with respect to an excise tax on corporations organized pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the commissioner of the Department of Revenue.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The securities, evidences of indebtedness, and shares of the capital stock issued by the corporation established under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer, and income therefrom and deposits of financial institutions invested therein, shall at all times be free from taxation within the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="p7">(4/27/2018). KRS 136.070 was repealed in 2018 Ky. Acts chs. 171 and 207, but a conforming amendment was not made to this statute to address the reference it contains to KRS 136.070. The Reviser of Statutes has determined that making such a conforming change during the 2018 codification exceeds the permissible correction of manifest clerical or typographical errors under KRS 7.136(1)(h). Therefore, the reference to KRS 136.070 remains unchanged and would have to be changed pursuant to future legislative action.</p>
