<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 228 of the Constitution requires an officer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>taking the oath of office to be a citizen or resident of Kentucky, and Const.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>§ 234 requires all civil officers of Kentucky to reside in Kentucky;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>therefore, that provision of KRS 423.110(6) relating to the appointment of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a special notary living in a foreign jurisdiction is unconstitutional. However,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>under the principle of severability, as expressed in this section and KRS 423.110, minus the offending language involving appointing nonresidents, is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>constitutional; thus the special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 423.110, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>such exercise of functions does not violate the public policy of or is not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction.

Therefore, the remaining statutory provisions<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Acts 1988, ch. 376 can and should remain in force. OAG 88-51.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 119.025, in its entirety, is unconstitutional;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is not amenable to severability because the provisions are too intertwined,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thus making it impossible to determine the intent of the legislature if one<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or the other of the two (2) subsections are deemed to be unconstitutional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>OAG 89-84.</p>
