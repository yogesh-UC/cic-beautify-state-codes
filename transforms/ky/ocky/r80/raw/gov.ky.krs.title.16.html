<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The adoption of KRS Chapter 186A in conjunction with the existing provisions of this chapter, had the effect of changing the law of Kentucky from an equitable title state to a certificate of title state for the purposes of determining ownership of a motor vehicle for liability insurance requirements. The general law of sales is no longer applicable to such a situation because of the statute. Potts v. Draper, 864 S.W.2d 896, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Evidence of Ownership.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Compliance with the motor vehicle licensing statute of this chapter is not dispositive of ownership since ownership is a factual issue. Dixon v. Kentucky Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 602 S.W.2d 173, 1980 Ky. LEXIS 240 (Ky. 1980).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A conditional vendee does not use an insured automobile with the consent or permission of the conditional vendor, and hence, is ordinarily not within the coverage of an omnibus clause of a liability insurance policy issued on the vehicle.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was an oral conditional sales agreement between the parties and no evidence was adduced that upon performance of his duty to pay the balance of the purchase price, the uninsured buyer did not have a right to possess the vehicle for a period of 365 days or more, buyer was deemed to have been the owner of the vehicle for purposes of KRS 186A.215(1), therefore, buyer was not insured within the meaning of the omnibus clause in seller’s insurance policy because seller did not own the vehicle on the date of the collision. Cowles v. Rogers, 762 S.W.2d 414, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 182 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988), overruled in part, Wheeler v. Rogers, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 64 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The auto seller was the owner of the vehicle involved in an accident that had been bought by the purchaser days earlier. Although the purchaser had driven the vehicle off of the auto seller’s lot a few days earlier, the auto seller did not meet both requirements of transferring ownership of the vehicle without assigning a certificate of title, set forth in KRS 186A.220(5), because the auto seller did not obtain the purchaser’s consent to file the certificate of title and other documents on the purchaser’s behalf and did not verify that the purchaser had obtained insurance on the vehicle before relinquishing possession. Gainsco Cos. v. Gentry, 191 S.W.3d 633, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 68 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of “owner” in KRS 186.010 is not the correct definition to apply to vehicle forfeiture under the controlled substances chapter. While KRS ch. 218A does not specifically define “owner,” KRS 218A.405(1)(b) and (5)(b) define “interest in property” and “trustee.” Defining “owner” as one who has an interest in property when title is being held by another appropriately prevents a drug dealer from titling vehicles or other property in someone else’s name in order to use the property in illegal activity and escape forfeiture. Commonwealth v. Coffey, 247 S.W.3d 908, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 65 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 186A.215, title to a pickup truck transferred upon the seller’s and insured’s completion of the transfer of title and odometer statement on the certificate of title and the delivery of the completed form to the insured; KRS 186A.215(4) allowed them a 15-day grace period after completion of the paperwork to file the certificate of title with the clerk. Therefore, the insured was the “owner” of the truck as defined by KRS 186.010(7)(a) at the time of an accident, and the truck was a “covered vehicle” under his insurance policy, Franklin v. Safe Auto Ins. Co., 290 S.W.3d 69, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 58 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alleged conditional sales agreement for the purchase of a vehicle was invalid and used car dealer was deemed to be owner of the vehicle and responsible for insurance coverage on the vehicle when it was involved in a collision where used car dealer, in an effort to facilitate potential repossession of the vehicle, did not transfer title of the vehicle to the buyers, where dealer renewed the registration in his own name when the vehicle’s license expired and did not advise the county clerk that he had “sold” the vehicle to the buyers, and where county clerk, in reliance on dealer’s omnibus policy, did not require proof of insurance. Rogers v. Wheeler, 864 S.W.2d 892, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 132 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an auto dealer had not assigned the title to a car sold to purchasers until after it was involved in an accident, the dealer’s insurer’s uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage was primary; the dealer had legal title and was the owner until it complied with the title assignment provisions of KRS 186A.220(5). Kelly v. McFarland, 243 F. Supp. 2d 715, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25018 (E.D. Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case involving the repossession of a leased car, because KRS 186.010(7)(b) made the lessee of a vehicle the “owner” for insurance purposes, the lessees of the leased car were considered the owners of the leased car, and their insurance policy provided primary coverage for the accident that occurred when the car was repossessed. Std. Fire Ins. Co. v. Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 234 S.W.3d 377, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 316 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not contemplate or authorize a conditional sale without transfer of title. The language used in the statute is intended to distinguish those leases which in reality are sales, or at the option of the leasee can be converted into a sale from a short term lease of less than 365 days with no right of purchase. Certainly conditional sales can be appropriate, but the vendor cannot disregard other statutes which are universal and compulsory in nature. Rogers v. Wheeler, 864 S.W.2d 892, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 132 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Authorization of a short-term conditional sale without transfer of title so long as the dealer insured the vehicle directly conflicts with KRS 186A.220(5). Rogers v. Wheeler, 864 S.W.2d 892, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 132 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A conditional sales contract is one where title is retained by the seller in order to secure payment by the purchaser. Once payment has been made in full, then the title is to be transferred to the purchaser pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Potts v. Draper, 864 S.W.2d 896, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Transaction was not a conditional sale since used car dealer was not holding title to the van until full performance of the contract terms by the buyers where dealer transferred title to buyers one week after accident occurred even though they never finished paying for the van; therefore, where title had been assigned to used car dealer and the transaction between used car dealer and buyer was not a conditional sale, and where insurer insured all motor vehicles owned by used car dealer, van was insured by used car dealer’s insurer on the day of the collision. Potts v. Draper, 864 S.W.2d 896, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the Uniform Commercial Code, KRS 355.1-203, an agreement between a trust and a debtor constituted a security interest rather than an unexpired lease, as the rental payments over the term of the agreement reflected a purchase price of the vehicles with interest; nor was the agreement an executory contract as defined by 11 U.S.C.S. 365, as the debtor had no continuing obligations under the agreement other than payment. Further, under the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, KRS 186.010(7)(b), a conditional lessee, such as the debtor, could be considered the owner for the purposes of registering the vehicle, which the undisputed evidence showed was done, rendering the trust’s reliance on KRS 186A.215 inapplicable. Magdovitz Family Trust v. KY USA Energy, Inc. (In re KY USA Energy, Inc.), 449 B.R. 745, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1993 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 2011).</p>

Potts v. Draper, 864 S.W.2d 896, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 186A.220(5) permits the customary practice of dealers in Kentucky of taking the applicable documents to the clerk’s office on behalf of the buyer, and so long as the seller and buyer complete the necessary paperwork at the time of the sale and then one of the parties promptly submits papers to the county clerk, title passes at the time of the sale for liability insurance purposes; thus, auto dealer following customary practice was relieved of all of its duties, including the responsibility to provide liability insurance prior to date of buyer’s accident.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the legislature intended that legislative district should mean state representative district, this section permits the county clerk of Knott County to establish one branch office in the county for the purpose of issuing license plates during the vehicle license period, but would not empower him to take license plates into each voting precinct for that purpose. The one branch office could be located at the voting place in a precinct provided that the voting place is a building used for a public purpose. OAG 73-435.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Except in the case of counties of less than 150,000 population containing a city of the second class, this section is the only authority under which a county court clerk may establish a branch office outside of the county seat.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of this section was to provide that the county clerk or the circuit clerk may maintain two or more branch offices, as needed in each state representative district in the county, since the conjunctive word “and” may be construed in the disjunctive when necessary to effectuate the obvious intention of the legislature. OAG 82-43 (modifying OAG 73-435).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Population density and convenience to motor vehicle owners in licensing motor vehicles were at the forefront of legislative intent in enacting this section; accordingly, the county clerk, depending upon the need for same under the above contextual criteria, may maintain two or more branch offices in each legislative district. OAG 82-43 (modifying OAG 73-435).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section narrowly relates to only the issuance of motor vehicle license plates, as concerns the county clerk, while subsection (1) of KRS 67.035 is designed to accommodate any other function of the county clerk in the county; accordingly, assuming that Pike County has a land area of more than 750 square miles, the fiscal court of Pike County may authorize the county clerk to maintain a branch office in any incorporated (other than in Pikeville) or unincorporated city of Pike County but only on a reasonable showing of the necessity for such branches.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the benefit bestowed in this section is tied in exclusively with 38 USCS § 1901, the free certificate and license plates authorized by this section are confined to the one vehicle provided by the veterans’ administration and there is no statutory authority for selling the special “Handicapped Veteran” license plates.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a National Guard member may only have a special license plate for one vehicle at a time, a guardsman must pay only a one time registration fee regardless of how long he keeps his vehicle or how often he changes vehicles and transfers the plate from one vehicle to the next.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The prohibition on cities under former subsection (4) of this section from imposing any automobile license fee was restricted to one vehicle owned by a qualifying veteran; accordingly, any additional motor vehicle owned by the disabled veteran would require the veteran to pay the regular motor vehicle license fee levied by the city. OAG 81-194.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither this section nor KRS 189.456 requires a city to provide specific handicapped parking facilities though there appears to be an implication to this effect under former KRS 189.456(6) which authorizes handicapped persons qualifying to park in a designated handicapped parking place even when a parking limit is imposed, by allowing such vehicle to be parked for a period of two hours in excess of the legal parking period prescribed by the local authorities with certain exceptions mentioned therein.

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> In enacting this section, it is the intention of the General Assembly to recognize the special value of historic vehicles to the Commonwealth, and also to recognize that historic vehicles, because of their limited use and easily identifiable characteristics, do not require the same degree of regulation as other vehicles.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, “historic vehicle” shall mean all motor vehicles twenty-five (25) years old or older, which are used primarily for exhibition in shows, parades, tours, and other special uses, but not for general transportation.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Upon payment of the fee established in KRS 186.162 and an application in accordance with regulations issued by the Transportation Cabinet, the secretary of the Transportation Cabinet shall issue a certificate of registration and two (2) special license plates of a different color and design than the regular license plate, which, in the judgment of the secretary of the Transportation Cabinet, will best advertise, popularize, and promote the Commonwealth of Kentucky. These plates, besides the word “Kentucky” shall have the words, “Historic Motor Vehicle” inscribed in a conspicuous manner and carry no year date. These plates shall have a serial number beginning with the number “100” and continue in a consecutive numerical sequence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Historic vehicles may display an authentic Kentucky license plate, twenty-five (25) years or older, or a reproduction of such a plate, if the historic motor vehicle plate and the registration receipt are kept in the vehicle at all times.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> If payment in full has been made under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the discharge of the lien shall be made not later than ten (10) days from the receipt of the payment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> When a security interest has been paid in full and a termination statement or discharge has not been filed, the debtor may petition the Circuit Court in the county of the debtor’s residence to order the discharge of the security interest. The debtor shall present written evidence to the Circuit Court that the security interest has been paid in full. If the evidence presented to the Circuit Court proves to the court’s satisfaction that the security interest has been paid in full, the court shall order the county clerk to note the termination on the title and to remove the lien from the Automated Vehicle Information System (AVIS). A copy of the court’s order shall immediately be sent to the county clerk in the county where the security interest was originally filed and the county clerk shall discharge the security interest and remove the lien information from AVIS in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Whenever a security interest has been discharged, other than by proceedings under Part 6 of Article 9 of KRS Chapter 355 or similar proceedings, the secured party shall:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Deliver an authenticated termination statement in the manner required by KRS 355.9-513 and 186A.195 to the county clerk of the county in which the title lien statement was submitted; or</p>

The county clerk, upon receipt of the authenticated termination statement in the manner prescribed under this paragraph, shall verify the legitimacy of the document.</p>
<p class="p7">The secured party shall also deliver a copy of the termination statement to the debtor or the debtor’s transferee. For failure to file the termination statement within the allowable time, the secured party shall be subject to the penalty provided in KRS 186.990(1). Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, within five (5) days after the receipt of such documents, the county clerk shall note the filing in the index, in language prescribed by the cabinet, that the termination statement has been filed. Upon presentation of the owner’s title showing a security interest to the county clerk where the termination statement was submitted, and with the copy of the termination statement submitted by the secured party, the clerk shall discharge the security interest by noting on the title that the termination statement has been filed and place the seal of the county clerk thereon. The clerk shall return the owner’s title to the owner. The county clerk shall then file the termination statement in the place from which the title lien statement was removed. Termination statements shall be retained in the clerk’s files for a period of two (2) years subsequent to the date of filing a statement, at which time they may be destroyed. The fee for these services are included in the provisions of KRS 186A.190.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Upon presentation of an owner’s title showing a security interest to the county clerk of a county where the termination statement was not delivered, the county clerk shall access the automated system to determine whether a record of termination of the security interest has been entered into the automated system by the county clerk where the termination statement was delivered by the secured party as provided in KRS 186A.210. If a record of termination has been entered into the automated system, the county clerk of the county where the termination statement was not delivered, shall note the discharge of the security interest on the certificate of title by noting that the termination statement has been delivered, the county where it was delivered, and placing the seal of the county clerk thereon and may rely on the automated system to do so. If a record of termination has not been entered into the automated system, the county clerk of the county other than where the termination statement was delivered shall not make any notation upon the certificate of title that the security interest has been discharged or that a termination statement has been delivered to the county where the title lien statement was submitted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Whenever any secured party repossesses a vehicle titled in Kentucky, for which a security interest is in existence at the time of repossession, and disposes of the vehicle pursuant to the provisions of KRS Chapter 355, the secured party shall present, within fifteen (15) days after such disposition, the vehicle’s license plate if the plate has not been retained by the previous owner, an affidavit in a form prescribed by the department, proof of notification of all interested parties pursuant to KRS 186A.190 and 355.9-611, and a termination statement or proof that a termination statement has been filed. The new owner shall pay to the county clerk all applicable fees for titling and transferring the vehicle into his or her name. Upon receipt of such documents, the county clerk who issued the lien shall then omit from the title he makes application for any information relating to the security interest under which the vehicle was repossessed or any security interest subordinate thereto. However, any security interest, as shown by such title which is superior to the one under which the vehicle was repossessed, shall be shown on the title issued by the clerk unless the prior secured party has discharged the security interest in the clerk’s office or proof of termination is submitted, if the prior security interest was discharged in another clerk’s office.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> Whenever any vehicle brought into Kentucky is required to be titled and the vehicle is then subject to a security interest in another state as shown by the out-of-state documents presented to the clerk, the county clerk is prohibited from processing the application for title on the vehicle unless the owner obtains from the secured party a financing statement or title lien statement and presents same to the clerk along with the fees required in KRS 186A.190. The clerk shall note the out-of-state security interest on the certificate of title. This provision does not apply to vehicles required to be registered in Kentucky under forced registration provisions under KRS 186.145.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The fees provided for in this section are in addition to any state fee provided for by law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> Any person violating any provision of this section or any person refusing to surrender a certificate of title registration and ownership or transfer certificate upon request of any person entitled thereto, is subject to the penalties provided in subsection (1) of KRS 186.990.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> The county clerk is prohibited from noting any security interest on a certificate of title on any vehicle subject to the provisions of KRS Chapter 186A if a certificate of title therefor is presented to him which has all the spaces provided thereon for noting security interests fully exhausted. The owner is responsible for ensuring that a discharge is noted on the certificate of title for each security interest and then a duplicate title as provided for in KRS 186A.180 shall be obtained from the clerk by the owner of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> Security interests in vehicles sold to or owned by residents of other states shall be perfected in the state of the nonresident and repossession of the vehicle shall be taken pursuant to the laws of that state, unless:</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a graphic review of the legislative history indicates that a uniform fee was intended for the filing of financing statement, regardless of whether a motor vehicle or some other item of personal property is involved, and in 1974 the fee under this section was inadvertently stated to be $4.00 instead of $4.75, the clerk’s fee for filing an original financing statement is uniformly $4.75.

OAG 76-66.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the general rule holds that a corporation usually remains a resident of the state of its incorporation and in the absence of a manifest legislative intent or reported case asserting a contrary exception to the general rule, a qualified foreign corporation is a nonresident under this section and accordingly the proper office to file a financing statement on the motor vehicles under subsection (1) of this section is with the county clerk of the county in which the vehicle is principally operated.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An individual who is a resident of the state of Kentucky and owns a tractor trailer which is licensed in another state and is principally operated in Ohio and Indiana and such vehicle is not registered in Kentucky and will not be used on the highways of Kentucky and therefore is not required to be registered in Kentucky, the proper place of filing a security interest on such trailer would be in the office of the county court clerk in the county of debtor’s residence as provided in former KRS 355.9-401(1)(c) and an affidavit of the owner or secured party should be filed with the county court clerk indicating that the vehicle is not being used on the highways of Kentucky and thus does not require registration in Kentucky. OAG 77-48.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no conflict between subsection (5) of this section (now subsection (9)) and KRS 355.9-404 for one involves a criminal offense for violation and the other involves a civil debt for violation. OAG 77-49.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section (now subsection 6, pursuant to the 2003 amendment) originally charged an additional penalty fee for late compliance, but allowed the secured party to perfect his security interest in the motor vehicle, while the 1978 amendment to subsection (3) (now subsection 6) cut off the secured party’s ability to perfect his security interest under KRS Chapters 355 and 186 if the secured party does not comply within 15 days from the date the security agreement was executed; it therefore seems that subsection (3) (now subsection 6) as amended is at best a mistake which is not truly indicative of the legislative intent. OAG 78-423.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county clerk may not refuse to file a financing statement even though offered for filing more than 15 days after execution of the security agreement, since the power of the county clerk is purely administrative, not judicial.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It would appear that in order for the transfer of a motor vehicle to be precluded, the information must actually appear on the certificate of registration of the motor vehicle and the fact that it may be on the computer files in the clerk’s office is not sufficient. OAG 79-31.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 186.230(9) must be read in connection with this section covering the time for filing financing statements affecting vehicles, fees and notations showing security interests. OAG 79-31.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the clerk is not personally responsible for determining how the house trailer is being used, he may rely upon the secured party’s representation that it is or is not subject to registration, and may rely upon the secured party’s representation that a financing statement is all that is required, or if the secured party also presents a registration receipt, he may note the lien thereon. OAG 79-57.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are two means for perfecting a security interest in a house trailer: if the house trailer is being used in one place as a permanent dwelling, then filing a financing statement serves to perfect the security interest, but if the house trailer falls within the definition of KRS 186.650, it is subject to registration and insofar as practicable a financing statement should be filed and registration receipt should be presented for notation of the lien thereon. OAG 79-57.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a seller-lienholder to have an enforceable lien against a vehicle, the lien must be noted on the motor vehicle registration receipt of record in the county clerk’s office. OAG 79-511.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where one company filed a financing statement in September of 1979, listing a mobile home, with an accompanying affidavit that the mobile home would not be used on public highways, and a second company filed a financing statement in October of 1979, listing the same mobile home, with an accompanying license registration receipt issued by the county clerk’s office on which the second company was listed as the first lienholder on the mobile home, the fact that at the time of the filing of the first company’s financing statement there was no certificate of registration for the mobile home in existence in no way militates against the principle that the proper filing of the financing statement perfected the lien; the county clerk is now required to note the first lien of the company that filed the September statement on the certificate of registration that came into existence later. OAG 80-103.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A federal certificate of sale of seized property should be treated as having the same effect as a bill of sale of a motor vehicle and the county clerk should issue a certificate of registration to the purchaser if other statutory conditions are met; any unreleased liens should be noted on the new certificate of registration unless the clerk has proof presented to him that the liens are subordinate to the federal tax lien but no subordinate liens should be noted on the registration certificate. OAG 80-510.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county clerk is still entitled to a five percent commission out of each $2.00 penalty even though the 1980 amendment to this section did not refer to the commission; since the penalty is associated with a tax provided for under KRS 142.010, each county clerk is entitled to the commission figured on the total of the tax and the attendant penalty. OAG 80-534.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The General Assembly, by the 1980 amendment of subsection (3) (now subsection 6, pursuant to the 2003 amendment) of this section putting the $2.00 penalty provision back into the law, intended it to return the state of the law to the posture it was in prior to the 1978 amendment; that is, while the county clerk is to collect the lienholder penalty, the clerk is to remit this penalty to the department of revenue. OAG 80-534.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The lienholder on a truck which belonged to a Kentucky resident debtor and was used, titled and subject to a security agreement in Indiana would not have to file the Indiana security agreement in Kentucky under the provisions of subsection (4) of KRS 355.9-103 even if the truck should be required to be licensed in Kentucky due to the operation of the truck there for more than five days, under the express language of subsection (2)(a) of this section. OAG 81-369 (decision prior to 1986 amendment of this section).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 186A.190(3) (now (5)), former 186A.060(14)(a), and this section prohibit the county clerk from listing more than two liens on the certificate of title in connection with the registration or titling of the vehicles; however, the information in KRS 186A.060 required to be filed in conjunction with the liens indicates the legislature intended that its restriction of two liens apply only to commercial liens and there is no such limit to the number of statutory liens such as liens for unpaid property taxes. There is no restriction against placing any type of indicator on the certificate of title that other liens exist. OAG 84-81.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since commercial liens are referred to in KRS 186A.190(3), former 186A.060(14), and this section, the clerk should place these on the certificate of title, if they exist, and then after any commercial liens are listed, the clerk should place the tax liens on the certificate, where space permits, or into the computer. OAG 84-81.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the current registration-title law relating to motor vehicles, the General Assembly by this section and KRS 186A.060, 186A.175 (now repealed) and 186A.190 has made provisions for showing not more than two liens on the certificate of title.

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a tractor or motor vehicle was licensed under subsection (3) of this section, the fee would apply to the registering and licensing of the trailer. OAG 61-335.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is reciprocity between Ohio and Kentucky on trucks engaged in private business operations, and not as common or contract carriers, where the weight is 18,000 pounds or less. OAG 63-123.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a vehicle engaged in private business operations in both Kentucky and Ohio has a declared gross weight of 18,001 pounds or more, the provisions of KRS 186.055 apply and the vehicle must have a Kentucky weight tag regardless of whether it is licensed in Kentucky or in Ohio. OAG 63-123.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the general assembly, after amending this section in 1973 by adding subsection (14), by an apparent oversight, did not amend KRS 47.020 to include this subsection it is clear that it is the legislative intent to share all the fees collected under the provisions of subsections (3) through (14) of this section with the counties, and, therefore, fees collected pursuant to subsection (14) of this section are required to be included with all fees distributable pursuant to KRS 47.020. OAG 73-428.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the applicant is “a farmer engaged solely in the production of crops, live-stock or dairy products” and uses the truck for the transportation of logs cut from his farm then he has satisfied the requirement that the truck be used only in transporting “products grown on his farm” but if the party involved is using this truck to haul logs for hire or to haul logging equipment to other areas so that he might do custom work, then this is in violation of the certification required. OAG 73-710.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “El Camino” and “Sprint” are pick-up trucks and should be registered as trucks. OAG 74-302.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a statutory lien on the vehicle is created on behalf of a county clerk when a check to him for registration fees is dishonored, he may not make a note of such lien on the registration receipt. OAG 74-744.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since logs are a primary forest product, trucks transporting them less than 50 miles from cutting to the mill are required to pay only the 40% reduced fee, but slabs are a forest by-product and trucks transporting them are not entitled to the reduced fee. OAG 75-560.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Until such time as the court sees fit to expand its charitable definition to include motor vehicles owned by religious nonprofit cemetery organizations from the motor vehicle usage tax, such vehicles are subject to the tax. OAG 78-579.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (9) of this section allows the transportation of coal from the mine to an unloading point within 50 air miles of the mine whether the unloading point is a railhead, tipple, plant, barge or any other location which is no more than 50 air miles from the mine where the coal was dug, in order to qualify for the 40% fee charge. OAG 80-443.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the statute must be applied to those terms without resort to any construction or interpretation; as subsection (9) specifies that to receive a fee reduction, the operator of a motor vehicle having a declared gross weight in excess of eighteen thousand pounds must “exclusively” transport primary forest products, operators who transport other products are not entitled to the fee reduction.

The effective date of that amendment was subject to a contingency, but the contingency was removed in 2012. Section 5 of 2012 Ky. Acts ch. 139, which is effective July 12, 2012, repeals 2011 Ky.

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The SF portion of the fee required under KRS 186.162 shall include the fee to reflectorize all license plates under KRS 186.240. All EF fees required under KRS 186.162 shall be collected at the time of an initial or renewal application by the county clerk who shall forward the EF fee to the cabinet.

<p class="p6"><b>(4) (a)</b> If a special license plate issued under this chapter deteriorates to the point that the lettering, numbering, or images on the face of the plate are not legible, the plate shall be replaced free of charge, if the owner or lessee has not transferred the vehicle to which the plate was issued during the current licensing period.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Upon the sale, transfer, or termination of a lease of a vehicle with any special license plate issued under this chapter, the owner or lessee shall remove the special plate and return it and the certificate of registration to the county clerk.

If the owner or lessee requests, the county clerk shall reissue the special plate upon payment of a three dollar ($3) county clerk fee for use on any other vehicle of the same classification and category owned, leased, or acquired by the person during the current licensing period. If the owner or lessee has the special plate reissued to a vehicle which has been previously registered in this state, the regular license plate that is being replaced shall be returned to the county clerk who shall forward the plate to the Transportation Cabinet.</p>

A person applying for a special license plate shall apply in the office of the county clerk in the county of the person’s residence, except as provided in KRS 186.168(3). All special license plates issued under this chapter may be combined with a personalized license plate under the provisions of KRS 186.174.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature intended the statute to apply to both temporary and permanent license plates, and the conclusion that this is the correct interpretation is reinforced by the language an administrative regulation, which governs the issuance and physical appearance of temporary tags, uses the term “temporary registration plates,” which strongly suggests that the requirements of the statute are applicable to temporary tags.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who sells an automobile to a minor under 18 years of age is not liable for his negligence. If “owner” was construed to include “seller” this statute would be unconstitutional. Ingram's Adm'r v. Advance Motor Co., 283 Ky. 87, 140 S.W.2d 840, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 300 (Ky. 1940).</p>

The fact that a judgment has been obtained against the minor, and that the judgment may be conclusive against the parent on the questions of negligence and damages, makes no difference. Robinson v.

Should a prosecutor note that the defendant has been previously convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his license was revoked or suspended based upon another statute, e.g. KRS 186.560 or 186.570, the defendant should be prosecuted under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section and KRS 186.642(3) (now repealed), which provide enhancement penalties for other types of subsequent revocation and suspension violations.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trailers used solely to lower gravesite vaults into the grave must be registered even though they are not used for transportation because they are within the legal definition of a trailer in design and capabilities. OAG 76-123.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in this section indicating that the term “other officers” includes the circuit clerk. OAG 76-357.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts 1976, ch. 236 and ch. 133 as they relate to registration of motor vehicles, house trailers, mobile homes, or recreational vehicles and the collection of sales and use tax on such vehicles do not apply to the registration of motor boats, since the term “recreational vehicles” and the term “motor vehicle” do not embrace motor boats. OAG 76-357.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clerk does not have to search the record to determine whether there are any outstanding security interests on the house trailer if he subsequently issues a new certificate of title pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, rather his only duty under the statute is to obtain an affidavit, and to that effect he may rely upon the statements therein; the duty of searching the title rests upon the subsequent lender or buyer. OAG 79-57.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clerk will not be liable for any losses incurred by the prior lender if its lien of record was not noted in the affidavit where he issues a new certificate of title pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. OAG 79-57.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where one company filed a financing statement in September of 1979, listing a mobile home, with an accompanying affidavit that the mobile home would not be used on public highways, and a second company filed a financing statement in October of 1979, listing the same mobile home, with an accompanying license registration receipt issued by the county clerk’s office on which the second company was listed as the first lienholder on the mobile home, the fact that at the time of the filing of the first company’s financing statement there was no certificate of registration for the mobile home in existence in no way militates against the principle that the proper filing of the financing statement perfected the lien; the county clerk is now required to note the first lien of the company that filed the September statement on the certificate of registration that came into existence later. OAG 80-103.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whereas the General Assembly had not given the Transportation Cabinet the authority to extend the time for the registration of Kentucky trailers, the registration deadline remained April 1 as provided in subsection (4) of this section, and therefore, a commissioner of the Transportation Cabinet had no authority to extend the registration deadline for trailers to April 30.

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> An automated motor vehicle and trailer registration and titling system shall be developed and implemented as expeditiously as practicable in all counties of the Commonwealth. The automated motor vehicle and trailer registration system shall be designed to enable Kentucky’s county clerks to produce motor vehicle and trailer certificates of registration in their offices, and certificates of title in Frankfort, by automated means utilizing telecommunication terminals and associated devices supplied by the Commonwealth, to inhibit registration and transfer of stolen motor vehicles or trailers, to improve the capability of detecting and recovering such vehicles, to ensure development of a common vehicle information database to improve efficiency in auditing motor vehicle usage tax, license fee collections, and in collecting personal property tax to provide information to the traffic record system, and to provide improved security interest protection to potential creditors throughout Kentucky while simultaneously reducing the number of forms that must be processed and stored each year in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The Transportation Cabinet is hereby directed to, as expeditiously as practicable, develop an automated motor vehicle and trailer registration and titling system, having, as a minimum, the capabilities or functions described in this chapter, and to acquire and assure the installation of such equipment or services as are necessary to enable the system as described in this chapter to be operated in all counties of the Commonwealth.</p>

A motor vehicle dealer licensed under KRS 186.070 shall apply to the county clerk of the county in which the dealer maintains his principal place of business for issuance of temporary tags. Application shall be made for such tags on forms supplied to the county clerk by the Transportation Cabinet.

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The county clerk of any county who receives a proper application for issuance of temporary tags shall record the number of each tag issued upon the application of the dealer for such tags, or if a group of consecutively numbered temporary tags are issued to a dealer in connection with a single application, record the beginning and ending numbers of the group on the application.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The clerk shall retain, for a period of two (2) years, one (1) copy of the dealer’s temporary tag application, and ensure that it reflects the numbers appearing on the tags issued with respect to such application.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> If the owner of a motor vehicle submits to the county clerk a properly completed application for Kentucky certificate of title and registration pursuant to KRS 186A.120, any motor vehicle required to be registered and titled in Kentucky, that is not currently registered and titled in Kentucky, may be equipped with a temporary tag, which shall be valid for thirty (30) days from the date of issuance, issued by the county clerk for the purpose of operating the vehicle in Kentucky while assembling the necessary documents in order to title and register the vehicle in Kentucky. The Transportation Cabinet may establish administrative regulations governing this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The county clerk may issue a temporary tag to the owner of a motor vehicle that is currently registered and titled in Kentucky. A temporary tag authorized by this subsection shall be used for emergency or unusual purposes as determined by the clerk for the purpose of maintaining the owner’s current registration. A temporary tag authorized by this subsection may only be issued by the county clerk and shall be valid for a period of between twenty-four (24) hours and seven (7) days, as determined is necessary by the clerk. A county clerk shall not issue a temporary tag authorized by this subsection unless the owner of the motor vehicle applying for the tag presents proof of motor vehicle insurance pursuant to KRS 304.39-080.

The county clerk may make title lien statements available to the general public.

The clerk shall indicate a title is not to be issued until the lien has been noted and fees, according to KRS 186A.190, paid in the county of the owner’s residence or in thirty (30) days. The county clerk shall then issue the registration. The county clerk in the county of the owner’s residence shall, after receiving the title lien statement and fees contained in KRS 186A.190, enter into the Automated Vehicle Information System (AVIS) the date of lien notation and the notation number, thus enabling the system to produce the title in Frankfort.</p>

The secured party shall submit the certificate of title along with the title lien statement to the county clerk of the county of the debtor’s residence. The county clerk shall then enter the information required by KRS 186A.190(9) into the Automated Vehicle Information System (AVIS) and note on the certificate of title in the appropriate section the information described in that section. Following the notation of the appropriate information on the certificate of title, the county clerk shall return the title to the debtor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The security interest noted on the certificate of title shall be deemed perfected at the time the security interest attaches (KRS 355.9-203) if the secured party tenders the required fees and submits a properly completed title lien statement and application for first title or, in the case of property previously titled in the name of its debtor, the certificate of title to the appropriate county clerk within thirty (30) days of attachment.

Further, under the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, KRS 186.010(7)(b), a conditional lessee, such as the debtor, could be considered the owner for the purposes of registering the vehicle, which the undisputed evidence showed was done, rendering the trust’s reliance on KRS 186A.215 inapplicable.

The district court rejected the creditor’s claim that the debt was nondischargeable under § 523(a)(4) because KRS 186A.220(5) created a trust for the creditor’s benefit that the debtor breached when a used car dealership he co-owned with his brother sold cars “out of trust,” in violation of an agreement the dealership entered with the creditor to obtain credit.

The court rejected the creditor’s argument that because the priority scheme in KRS 355.9-334(5)(d) provided a mechanism for a mortgage to have priority over a security interest in a titled mobile home, that this meant the mobile home could be perfected other than by a notation on its title.

Even had the creditor provided sufficient evidence that its lien was noted on a certificate of title issued before the debtor’s petition was filed, it still could not overcome the fact that it filed the title lien statement in the wrong county under KRS 186A.190(2) and thus, because the creditor’s lien on the mobile home was not properly perfected at the time the debtor filed bankruptcy, the trustee had superior title to the mobile home pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(1) and was entitled to recover the value of the debtor’s interest in the mobile home for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 550.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are no specific maximum length limits prescribed by statute for the “driveaway method” of transporting motor vehicle units. OAG 63-246.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “highway” does not include a newly constructed road before it is open to the public. OAG 67-455.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>School parking lots come within the definition of an approach to the highway as set out in subdivision (2) (now (3)) of this section. OAG 71-207.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of “highway” in this section encompasses a filling station or the parking lot of a restaurant at a time the establishment is closed and this definition would apply to KRS 244.020 (repealed) prohibiting intoxication on any public or private road. OAG 74-703.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The city police have authority to enforce traffic laws, issue citations and make arrests in the parking lots of apartment complexes, high schools, hospitals and churches providing off-street parking facilities for guests’ use. OAG 75-36.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clear legislative intent of this section, KRS 189.390 and 189.396 that peace officers shall enforce traffic laws in off-street parking facilities, including a speed limit of fifteen miles per hour, seems a reasonable exercise of the authority of the legislature to enact a law for the public good and until the sections are invalidated by a decision of the highest court of the state, all peace officers are legally obligated to enforce said sections. OAG 75-115.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A practice of city police officers of entering off-street parking facilities provided by apartment buildings for use of their tenants and tenants’ invitees, for purposes of placing citations on vehicles not bearing city sticker representing compliance with the city ordinance imposing a tax and permit for use of city streets, is illegal because such off-street parking facilities are not off-street facilities offered for public use within the definition of “highways” in the statute. OAG 75-164.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a farm tractor is being operated as a passenger vehicle or as towing a trailer, transporting passengers or property, it is required to comply with the traffic laws which apply to motor vehicles. OAG 78-712.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where only a traffic citation has been issued and no complaint is filed and no summons or warrant is issued, then the district court would have no jurisdiction of the person of a nonresident motorist until and unless the accused delivers himself in person to the court in obedience to the citation, or unless he enters his appearance by other means. OAG 78-318.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of “trailer” in this section does not apply to wagons pulled by farm tractors but only to trailers pulled by trucks. OAG 82-213.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The gross weight limit of 36,000 pounds, provided in KRS 189.221(4), applies to any truck, semitrailer truck or truck and trailer unit, operating upon any highway regardless of the nature of its cargo, including coal, timber or other natural resources; the truck weight limitation, which applies explicitly to “any highway,” would include county roads. OAG 85-40.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If roadways within mobile home park are offered for public use so as to be considered “public” roads (although privately owned or maintained), or if such roadways constitute off-street parking facilities offered for public use, other than for hire, they would be within the definition of “highway” as used in subsection (3) of this section. Accordingly, law enforcement officers could properly issue citations for speeding violations (KRS 189.390), or reckless driving violations (KRS 189.290), occurring upon such roadways. OAG 92-36.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the roads or streets of a specific subdivision, although privately owned, are subject to public access, so as to be “public roads” within the meaning of subsection (3) of this section, applicable speed limit provisions of KRS 189.390 would apply to them, and could be enforced upon them by law enforcement officers; additionally, Fiscal Court could, in the exercise of its police power, and in view of specific provisions of KRS 189.390 and this section provide, by proper ordinance, for speed limits on privately owned subdivision streets generally which are used by the public.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Cracked Windshield.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The cracks in defendant’s windshield were not a basis for a stop of his vehicle because the cracks were not a violation of KRS 189.110, which concerns window tinting, nor were they severe enough to unreasonably impair his forward vision, so they were not a violation of KRS 189.020, so a subsequent search to which defendant consented was invalid. Garcia v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 658, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applying the rule of ejusdem generis to KRS 189.020, the term “other nuisance” is preceded by the particular designation of “noise” and “smoke”; therefore, “other nuisance” should be interpreted as including only those nuisances of a similar kind as noise and smoke. Thus, the term “other nuisance” does not encompass a cracked windshield. Garcia v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 658, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the requirements of KRS 189.020 that a vehicle be equipped so as to protect the rights of other traffic, a cracked windshield must unreasonably impair the vision of a vehicle’s driver to constitute a violation of KRS 189.020. Garcia v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 658, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere hairline cracks of a vehicle’s windshield are not typically of sufficient severity to constitute a violation of KRS 189.020. Garcia v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 658, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Traffic stop was justified because driving in the left lane at full speed on two completely flat tires, with the rims striking the asphalt, is a factual scenario that does present a significant threat to public safety and to the safety of the driver, and suggests recklessness on the part of the driver; driving on a flat tire or tires may not always constitute a violation of the statute if a driver is proceeding slowly to a service station or to an area where it is safe to pull off the road.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The cracks in defendant’s windshield were not a basis for a stop of his vehicle because the cracks were not a violation of KRS 189.110, which concerns window tinting, nor were they severe enough to unreasonably impair his forward vision, so they were not a violation of KRS 189.020, so a subsequent search to which defendant consented was invalid.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a citizen observes overweight coal truck violations occurring in his presence, he should appear before a magistrate, county judge (now county judge/executive), police judge, or Circuit Judge for the purpose of swearing out a complaint charging violation of the pertinent statutory provisions. Although a citizen generally may not be qualified to determine the weight of a vehicle by mere observation, nevertheless he is capable of determining whether the truck is constructed so as to contain properly its contents (as required by this section) or whether the operator of the truck is guilty of littering the highways (thus offending KRS 433.753). OAG 70-522.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county ordinance requiring motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers operating upon county public roads and carrying cargo to be covered effectively to prevent cargo in such vehicles from spilling upon the highways is enforceable on county roads as it is not in conflict with either this section or KRS 189.231 and is also enforceable on state highways located within the county and the ordinance passed under the authority of the home rule statute (KRS 67.083) does not constitute an abdication of the state’s right to use its own police power to enforce the law. OAG 75-468.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite the fact that a person has been convicted six times in the past four years of violating this section by littering the highway by transporting chicken waste in a truck which leaked its contents on the highway, there is no statute providing for the abatement of such a nuisance by injunction and the facts do not constitute a common-law nuisance; however, the repeated offender could be convicted, if he offends in the same way again, under KRS 512.070 for criminal littering, a class B misdemeanor, and could be fined up to $250 or sentenced to 90 days in jail, or both.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are no specific maximum length limits prescribed by statute for the “driveaway method” of transporting motor vehicle units. OAG 63-246.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (1)(c) of this section, the maximum legal weight, including vehicle and load, which can be carried on a truck having three rear axles spaced 51 inches apart is 50,000 pounds, of which not more than 18,000 pounds can be carried on the front axle or any single axle in the tandem arrangement, and not more than 32,000 pounds can be carried on the three axles making up the single rear tandem.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the existing statutes and regulations there is no limit as to the number of vehicles which may be involved in a saddle-mount tow except that the length of the hook up shall be within the statutory limits. OAG 80-528.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the legislature specifically excluded from the axle weight provisions vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of farm products only, the Kentucky State Police cannot enforce axle weight provisions against such vehicles because of subsection (3) of this section, despite the fact that the Federal Highway Administration indicated that the exclusion contained in subsection (3) would jeopardize federal aid funds, in that the failure to enforce axle weight limits on federal aid roads in the state without regard to the use or licensing of the vehicle would violate federal law, since the will and intent of the legislature must control and since the legislative intent is explicitly and unambiguously expressed in the exemption for farm vehicles. OAG 81-250.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In connection with truck axles the language of subdivision (7)(b) (now (9)(b)) of this section refers to a “tridem axle” and since the Interstate Highway System is a part of the “federal aid highway system” referred to in subsection (7) (now (9)) of this section it follows that the maximum allowable weight for tridem axles used on the Interstate Highway System in Kentucky is 48,000 pounds.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where heavy coal trucks are operating on state highways through a city of the fourth class and causing serious damage to the sewer lines located under the pavement, the commissioner of highways (now secretary of transportation) has the responsibility for regulating traffic on streets accepted as part of the state highway system and may set new limits himself or relinquish jurisdiction to the city for the performance of this function. OAG 74-257.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the authority of KRS 67.080 and 67.083 the fiscal court has the authority to establish by proper order speed limits on county roads lower than those prescribed in KRS 189.390 and 189.391 (repealed) where such lower limits are necessary to the public health, safety, welfare and convenience, except in the special situation involving trucks under this section where the county judge may lower speed limits. OAG 75-74.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it was the legislative intent to restrict county court authority to weight limit decreases any court action providing for a weight limit increase would be in conflict with this section and therefore illegal. OAG 75-183.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the maximum weight limit of KRS 189.221 applies to all county roads which are not part of a state-maintained system, the county judge (now county judge/executive) may prescribe lower load limits under conditions outlined in this section.

OAG 78-461.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the language of this section refers to any lien, the plain wording of the statute makes it clear that the legislature intended that all liens which may be placed upon a motor vehicle are to fall within the purview of this section, but this does not mean that it is incumbent upon the county clerks to search their records to ascertain the existence of any liens.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicating beverages in violation of KRS 189.520 would not, on grounds of double jeopardy, bar a prosecution for reckless driving in violation of this section, even though the actions constituting the violations were committed simultaneously.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If roadways within mobile home park are offered for public use so as to be considered “public” roads (although privately owned or maintained), or if such roadways constitute off-street parking facilities offered for public use, other than for hire, they would be within the definition of “highway” as used in KRS 189.010(3).

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trucker was liable for nighttime head-on collision with automobile where truck was driven to left of center of highway, about 25 feet wide, and automobile was traveling on its right side; speed of automobile being immaterial. Thronton v. Phillips, 262 Ky. 346, 90 S.W.2d 347, 1936 Ky. LEXIS 31 (Ky. 1936).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In collision between oncoming motorcycle on right side of curving country highway and automobile on left side thereof, evidence of violation of statute by driver of automobile made prima facie case of negligent driving, requiring him to excuse wrongful driving.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where taxicab was passing a bicycle traveling in the same direction as they went through an intersection and another motorist operated her automobile into the intersection and into the left side of the taxicab in violation of posted stop signs causing the cab to strike the bicycle throwing the rider off and killing him, the trial court did not err in refusing to give instructions as to the duties of the operator of a vehicle in overtaking and passing another vehicle, because it is doubtful whether these rules apply to bicycles and, even if they do, the passing by the taxicab was not the proximate cause of the rider’s death. Tinsley's Adm'r v. Slate, 251 S.W.2d 883, 1952 Ky. LEXIS 952 (Ky. 1952).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an accident where the plaintiff’s brakes failed and he struck the defendant’s stopped truck from the rear, conceding but not deciding that this section was violated, the fact that the defendant’s truck was too wide to afford half the highway to oncoming traffic was not the proximate cause of the accident. Howard v. Fields, 433 S.W.2d 629, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 279 (Ky. 1968).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motorist was not guilty of contributory negligence where, on dark, foggy night he approached truck at 25 miles per hour, believing until time of collision that truck, which was parked on wrong side of country highway, was moving. Padgett v. Brangan, 228 Ky. 440, 15 S.W.2d 277, 1929 Ky. LEXIS 569 (Ky. 1929).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Oncoming motorist who had seen that bus had started to overtake and pass a truck, but had desisted and was pulling in behind truck, but who, although blinded by lights of oncoming truck and exceeding speed limit, proceeded to pass truck without slackening speed and struck darkened rear end of bus still protruding on left side of highway, was guilty of contributory negligence. United Coach Corp. v. Finley, 243 Ky. 658, 49 S.W.2d 544, 1932 Ky. LEXIS 165 (Ky. 1932).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where truck driver was negligent in driving on the left side of the highway, guest riding in automobile which collided with truck could recover from truck owners for injuries since the truck driver’s negligence was the proximate cause of the collision and although the automobile driver may have been contributorily negligent this could not be imputed to his guest. Williams v. Farmer's Adm'x, 273 Ky. 131, 115 S.W.2d 589, 1938 Ky. LEXIS 592 (Ky. 1938).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instruction on last clear chance that if driver of truck, hit by defendant who was on wrong side of road attempting to pass another truck traveling in the same direction, had sufficient space at the right so that he could have prevented the accident then he should have done so, but failing to submit issue of discovery of defendant’s peril, was erroneous. Pedigo v. Osborne, 279 Ky. 85, 129 S.W.2d 996, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 229 (Ky. 1939).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motorist may assume in the absence of something to put him on notice to the contrary that another he is meeting will conform to the law, and may act upon that assumption in determining his own manner of using the road, but if by due care he discovers the other motorist in the wrong and cannot or will not yield, he must take precaution to avoid the collision under the “last clear chance” doctrine. Short v. Robinson, 280 Ky. 707, 134 S.W.2d 594, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 195 (Ky. 1939).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>9. Question for Jury.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there were no eyewitnesses to collision and physical evidence indicated that operator of automobile was driving on wrong side of highway in violation of this section the question of negligence should have been submitted to the jury since proof that operator of an automobile is traveling on the wrong side of the highway created a prima facie case of negligent driving where it results in injury to other users of the highway when on the right side of the road and it becomes the duty of the defendant if he would avoid the effect of such prima facie showing to explain and excuse the fact that his automobile was on the wrong side of the road. Stark's Adm'x v. Herndon's Adm'r, 292 Ky. 469, 166 S.W.2d 828, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 91 (Ky. 1942).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action involving collision occurring when driver attempted to pass car ahead, instruction on duties under KRS 189.300 and this section, was proper, where evidence warranted it and it did not give undue prominence to fact in issue. Sheetinger v. Dawson, 236 Ky. 571, 33 S.W.2d 609, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 792 (Ky. 1930).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action governed by this section instruction that certain rate of speed was prima facie evidence of negligence, thus indicating that presumption of law was against defendant, was improper. Summerville v. Waller, 262 Ky. 343, 90 S.W.2d 65, 1935 Ky. LEXIS 788 (Ky. 1935).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was reversible error where instructions imposed duties of this section and the common-law duty of ordinary care to avoid injuring persons on the highway on truck driver while imposing only the common-law duty to exercise ordinary care for his own safety and the safety of his automobile on driver of automobile. Williams v. Coleman's Adm'x, 273 Ky. 122, 115 S.W.2d 584, 1938 Ky. LEXIS 591 (Ky. 1938).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that bus was proceeding at very slow rate of speed in meeting truck, and that auto behind truck suddenly pulled out directly in path of bus, causing bus driver to bring bus to a sudden stop, resulting in injury to passenger, justified peremptory instruction for defendant bus owner in action by passenger. Lyons v. Southeastern Greyhound Lines, 282 Ky. 106, 137 S.W.2d 1107, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 137 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section does not fix any rate of speed to be observed in meeting other vehicles, it was prejudicial error to instruct the jury on a rate of speed provided in an earlier statute. Gorman v. Berry, 289 Ky. 88, 158 S.W.2d 155, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 511 (Ky. 1942).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case involving a collision between cars proceeding in opposite directions on the same street, an instruction under subsection (1) of KRS 189.300 was proper and sufficient, and it was not necessary to give instruction under subsection (2) of this section. Hollis v. Bourne, 292 Ky. 578, 167 S.W.2d 50, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 126 (Ky. 1942).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When two vehicles moving in opposite directions are approaching a bridge or passage too narrow for the vehicles to pass, it is the duty of each operator to exercise ordinary care to prevent collision and in so doing to avoid the contingency of being on the bridge or in the passage at the same time. Short v. Robinson, 280 Ky. 707, 134 S.W.2d 594, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 195 (Ky. 1939).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When two (2) vehicles approach or enter an intersection from different roadways at approximately the same time, the operator of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The right-of-way rule declared in subsection (1) is modified at highways and through intersections and as otherwise stated in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Preferential right-of-way may be indicated by stop signs or yield signs. The state highway commissioner, with reference to state highways, and local authorities, with reference to other highways under their jurisdiction, may designate any intersection as a stop intersection or as a yield intersection and erect stop signs or yield signs at one (1) or more entrances to such intersections.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every operator of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator has view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such operator is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The operator of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in obedience to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After slowing and stopping, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such operator is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways; provided, however, that if such an operator is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection or junction of roadways after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to yield right-of-way.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The operator of a vehicle intending to turn shall do so as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Right turns — both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Left turns — the operator of a vehicle intending to turn left shall approach the turn in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection and so as to leave the intersection or other location in the extreme right-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the same direction as such vehicle on the roadway being entered.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> The Transportation Cabinet and local authorities in their respective jurisdictions may cause official traffic control devices to be placed and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this section be traveled by turning vehicles and, when such devices are so placed, no operator shall turn a vehicle other than as directed and required by such devices.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The operator of any vehicle shall not turn such vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction unless such movement can be made in safety without interfering with other traffic.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an intersection or into an alley, private road, or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> The operator of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any place other than another roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> On highways with a center lane restricted for left turns off the highway by vehicles proceeding in both directions:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> A left turn shall not be made from any other lane; and</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Refusal of court to instruct that if plaintiff relied exclusively on failure of electric signals to work without using ordinary care for his own safety then he was guilty of contributory negligence, was not error, since it is for jury to determine whether motorist, in proceeding across crossing where signals were not working, was using ordinary care under the circumstances in relying on the failure of the signals.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a peace officer spots a vehicle a short distance from the scene of an accident which he suspects as having been involved in the accident, he is justified in making an arrest for leaving the scene, for the reason that the driver is guilty of a continuing violation of this section and is still involved in leaving the scene at the time of the arrest, so that this misdemeanor is in fact being committed in the officer’s presence at the time of the arrest. It is not required that the officer witness the vehicle leaving the accident scene itself in order for the officer to make an arrest. OAG 82-301.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 189.635, keeping state police accident reports confidential with a few exceptions was upheld as constitutional as applied to a group of attorneys and chiropractors because it did not offend their First Amendment rights and because it rationally furthered a legitimate state interest, namely protecting the privacy of accident victims, it satisfied the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Amelkin v. McClure, 330 F.3d 822, 2003 FED App. 0168P, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 10832 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1050, 124 S. Ct. 827, 157 L. Ed. 2d 699, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 8627 (U.S. 2003).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a written accident report is provided by a law enforcement agency to the Bureau (now Department) of the State Police which forwards a copy of that report to the department of transportation, the practical purpose of accident reporting would be accomplished and the motor vehicle operator’s report would not have to be filed. OAG 77-56.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due to the absence of any exemptions, ambulance crews which are involved in an accident while responding to an emergency call must comply with the requirements of KRS 189.580 and of this section, if applicable, before proceeding to the scene of the emergency. OAG 80-187.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any member of the public may inspect an accident report made by a police officer concerning a fatal one-car accident, including the results of a blood alcohol test conducted on the deceased, since there is no provision in the Open Records Law exempting such a report. OAG 80-210.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Uniform police traffic accident reports prepared by law enforcement officers pursuant to this section are not confidential and are open records under the Open Records Law. OAG 89-76.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City police division did not have to respond to newspaper’s request to obtain copies of all traffic accident reports within the jurisdiction on a weekly basis. Although traffic accident reports prepared by law enforcement officers pursuant to this section are not confidential and are open records, the right to inspect public records attaches only after those records have been “prepared, owned, used, in the possession of or retained by a public agency.” No such right attaches for records which have not yet come into existence. The Open Records Act governs access to existing public records, not to prospective requests. City can require newspaper to submit a new application each time copies of records are requested and city need only honor requests for existing records. 97-ORD-18.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The police department may rely on KRS 189.635(5) as the basis for denying any request for accident reports not submitted by the parties to the accident, the parents or guardians of a minor who is party to the accident, the insurers of any party who is the subject of the report, the attorneys of the parties, and news gathering organizations “solely for the purpose of publishing or broadcasting the news.” This specific confidentiality provision overrides the general rule of openness mandated by the Open Records Act. OAG 01-ORD-127.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Division of Police improperly relied on KRS 61.878(1)(a) in partially denying news-gathering requesters access to those portions of accident reports containing information of a personal nature. Because KRS 189.635(6) places no restriction on the information in the accident reports that must be disclosed to news-gathering organizations, limiting only the use to which the information may be put, these organizations are entitled to the same right of access as the parties identified in KRS 189.635(5). OAG 02-ORD-19.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 189.635(5), in tandem with KRS 61.878(1)(l), requires that a public agency deny a request for copies of accident reports not submitted by parties to the accident, the parents or guardians of a minor who is party to the accident, the insurers of any party who is the subject of the report, the attorneys of the parties, and news gathering organizations “solely for the purpose of publishing or broadcasting the news.” This specific confidentiality provision overrides the general rule of openness mandated by the Open Records Act. OAG 02-ORD-155.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the Covington Police Department is required to prepare and file an accident report under KRS 189.635, that statute applies to it and its accident reports are exempt from disclosure, unless a requester falls within one of the classes entitled to a copy of the report. OAG 02-ORD-155.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Request for an accident report involving a city truck was proper under the Open Records Act; however, the requested record was excluded from public inspection by operation of KRS 189.635(5). OAG 06-ORD-024.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The confidentiality provision in KRS 189.635(5) admits of only the specifically enumerated exceptions found in its concluding sentence and in KRS 189.635(6). It does not permit disclosure of the accident report if the vehicle involved in the accident is a city vehicle being driven by a city employee. Nor does it permit disclosure based on the requester’s goals and intended use. OAG 2006-ORD-024.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where duly elected and qualified constables used their own vehicles equipped with an oscillating blue light in the performance of their official duties, such vehicles were not “emergency vehicles” as defined in subsection (1) of this section and therefore, they may not use blue flashing, blue revolving or blue oscillating lights as part of their motor vehicle equipment. Commonwealth v. Bradley, 516 S.W.2d 644, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Private vehicles owned by members of an organization known as REACT are not emergency vehicles within the definition of this section and are prohibited by KRS 189.050 from being equipped with flashing red lights. OAG 70-368.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A privately owned switching tractor used to tow trailers across city streets at a speed of 5-10 m.p.h. is a public safety vehicle within the meaning of this section. OAG 70-375.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A police vehicle also has the special exemptions when responding to accidents, fires, explosions, and plane crashes, to first aid requests, and to any other emergency. OAG 70-486.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 189.910 to 189.950 are not unconstitutional as stripping the constable of his powers as a constitutional officer because it does not allow him to use flashing blue lights on automobiles. OAG 70-608.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Privately owned vehicles used in assessing property taxes are not public safety vehicles within the meaning of KRS 189.910 to 189.950. OAG 71-200.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A funeral home employe cannot display a colored flashing light on his private automobile for use when he is called from his home to pick up an ambulance to make an emergency run because under KRS 189.910 to 189.990 only publicly owned or government operated emergency equipment may be equipped with flashing lights while moving on the highway. OAG 72-94.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no conflict between this section or section 189.920 with respect to the provisions of KRS 150.095 regarding conservation officers. OAG 72-695.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An ambulance is nonetheless an emergency vehicle when it is operated with a silent siren for the benefit of a patient which it is transporting but an ambulance driver should exercise greater caution in proceeding through an intersection with a silent siren. OAG 74-623.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an ambulance transporting a heart patient proceeds with a silent siren for the benefit of the patient, due care should dictate that speed of travel will have to be sacrificed especially when crossing an intersection. OAG 74-623.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It would be unlawful for a county police unit formed as part of a civil defense unit organized under the authority of the county judge or an auxiliary police force created by the fiscal court as provided by KRS 70.545 (repealed) to put blue signal lights on privately owned vehicles. OAG 74-634.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering the definition of “emergency vehicle” given in subsection (1) of this section, if the vehicle is used by the sheriff or his lawful deputies in the performance of his official duties and for law enforcement emergency purposes, it should be equipped with the blue lights required by subsection (2) of KRS 189.920 regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by the county, the sheriff, a deputy, or some other person or corporation; the term “lawful deputies” means those deputies filling regular deputy positions as authorized by orders of the fiscal court under KRS 64.530 and who work for the sheriff on a full work week basis for a reasonable compensation set by the fiscal court; therefore, full time, paid deputies can drive their own vehicles if authorized by the sheriff in performing their official duties of law enforcement and such vehicles should have blue lights. OAG 76-574.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there is no reference to a constable’s vehicle or to the duties of a constable in KRS 189.910 to 189.950, a constable’s vehicle is neither an “emergency vehicle” nor a “public safety vehicle” and may not be equipped with flashing, revolving or oscillating lights of any color or with a siren. OAG 78-207.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A vehicle used by a constable in performing his official duties does not come within the “emergency vehicles” authorized to contain flashing, oscillating blue lights, and thus a constable is not authorized to have such lights on his official vehicle. OAG 79-177.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Within the meaning of subsection (1) of this section, “commandeer” means to seize forcefully or arbitrarily. OAG 79-262.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only those vehicles specifically mentioned in KRS 189.910 to 189.950 shall be equipped with blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and since there is no mention of jailers and their vehicles, such vehicles cannot legally be equipped with such blue lights. OAG 80-231.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident. OAG 80-543.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in subsection (2) of this section that would enable a coroner’s vehicle to be considered a public safety vehicle. OAG 80-543.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The vehicles of constables are not “emergency vehicles”, as defined in subsection (1) of this section; accordingly, the fiscal court cannot pass an ordinance to authorize duly elected constables to place blue lights and sirens upon their cars to be used in the performance of their statutory duties. OAG 82-47.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 67.083(3)(u) provides that the fiscal court may pass ordinances relating to “provision of police and fire protection,” the subject matter of an ordinance authorizing constables to use blue lights and sirens on their official vehicles has been preempted by the General Assembly in the enactment of this section and KRS 189.920.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering the definition of “emergency vehicle” given in KRS 189.910(1), if the vehicle is used by the sheriff or his lawful deputies in the performance of his official duties and for law enforcement emergency purposes, it should be equipped with the blue lights required by subsection (2) of this section regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by the county, the sheriff, a deputy, or some other person or corporation; the term “lawful deputies” means those deputies filling regular deputy positions as authorized by orders of the fiscal court under KRS 64.530 and who work for the sheriff on a full work week basis for a reasonable compensation set by the fiscal court; therefore, full time, paid deputies can drive their own vehicles if authorized by the sheriff in performing their official duties of law enforcement and such vehicles should have blue lights. OAG 76-574.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there is no reference to a constable’s vehicle or to the duties of a constable in KRS 189.910 to 189.950, a constable’s vehicle is neither an “emergency vehicle” nor a “public safety vehicle” and may not be equipped with flashing, revolving or oscillating lights of any color or with a siren.

OAG 78-470.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A vehicle used by a constable in performing his official duties does not come within the “emergency vehicles” authorized to contain flashing, oscillating blue lights, and thus a constable is not authorized to have such lights on his official vehicle.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident. OAG 80-543.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The vehicles of constables are not “emergency vehicles,” as defined in KRS 189.910(1); accordingly, the fiscal court cannot pass an ordinance to authorize duly elected constables to place blue lights and sirens upon their cars to be used in the performance of their statutory duties. OAG 82-47.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 67.083(3)(u) provides that the fiscal court may pass ordinances relating to “provision of police and fire protection,” the subject matter of an ordinance authorizing constables to use blue lights and sirens on their official vehicles has been preempted by the General Assembly in the enactment of KRS 189.910 and this section.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A privately owned vehicle of a volunteer fireman, not equipped with the proper lights and audible devices, is not an “emergency vehicle” and is not exempt from traffic regulations so that the driver of such a vehicle, proceeding to the fire station in response to an alarm, must observe all traffic laws in the same manner required by other drivers. OAG 78-85.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the operator of an emergency vehicle should travel the wrong way on a one-way street only when the circumstances make it necessary to do so, each case has to be judged on its particular circumstances; and if the operator believes that the street is blocked as far as being able to travel the direction allowed and has his lights flashing and his siren sounding, he would be justified in proceeding the wrong way on the one-way street though caution would dictate that he should travel at a slow speed and give oncoming traffic ample opportunity to get out of his path. OAG 79-173.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An emergency vehicle may use any avenue available to it under the circumstances, even to traveling on the shoulder, sidewalk or median, but in such unusual maneuvers a driver should use special caution in proceeding and should use his lights and audible alarms.

Commonwealth v. Bradley, 516 S.W.2d 644, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section prohibits equipping vehicles owned by members of an organization known as REACT with flashing red lights since such vehicles are not emergency vehicles as defined by KRS 189.910. OAG 70-368.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section and KRS 432.570, the fiscal court does not have the authority to permit county auxiliary policemen to equip their cars with either flashing blue lights or police radios. OAG 75-500.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A volunteer fireman from Indiana with a blue flashing light on his car does not violate Kentucky law while driving in Kentucky as long as he does not turn the light on. OAG 76-30.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An “adviser to the jailer” who is not actually appointed to fill a deputy jailer position under KRS 64.345 may not equip his vehicle with or use a flashing, rotating or oscillating blue light since he is neither a deputy jailer or a peace officer but only a civilian employe of the police department. OAG 76-81.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A member of a volunteer fire department who equips his private vehicle with signals for use in emergency situations must use both visible and audible signals so that the vehicle will be seen and heard. OAG 76-165.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A privately owned vehicle of a volunteer fireman, not equipped with the proper lights and audible devices, is not an “emergency vehicle” and is not exempt from traffic regulations so that the driver of such a vehicle, proceeding to the fire station in response to an alarm, must observe all traffic laws in the same manner required by other drivers. OAG 78-85.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only those vehicles specifically mentioned in KRS 189.910 to 189.950 shall be equipped with blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and since there is no mention of jailers and their vehicles, such vehicles cannot legally be equipped with such blue lights. OAG 80-231.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident. OAG 80-543.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a fireman whose chief has authorized him, in writing, to equip his vehicle with flashing red lights and a siren pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may utilize those devices while proceeding to the scene of a fire or other emergency in the performance of his official duties as a member of the fire department, he may not utilize his flashing red lights and siren while departing from the scene of a fire or other emergency; accordingly, if it was determined that an accident victim needed to be rushed to a hospital and could not be transported under normal driving conditions, then an ambulance or other authorized emergency vehicle should have been called to the scene, because the fireman did not have the authority to utilize his flashing red lights and siren to depart from the scene and transport the accident victim to the hospital. OAG 81-236.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a fire chief has exercised his discretionary authority pursuant to this section and permitted, in writing, members of his fire department to equip their personal vehicles with flashing red lights and sirens for use while proceeding to the scene of a fire or other emergency, that permission to so act terminates when he ceases to be fire chief. Permission must be obtained in writing from the successor as fire chief if the members of the fire department are to continue to use flashing red lights and sirens on their private vehicles. OAG 82-126.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, any constable in Kentucky may use blue lights on his official emergency vehicle, provided such use is formally approved by the fiscal court of his county, except in an urban county government, where the constable’s use of blue lights must be approved by the urban county council. OAG 84-241.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a fiscal court to be liable for the wrongful conduct of a constable, the wrongdoing by the constable must be directly attributable to the use of the blue lights or siren and the fiscal court must have acted negligently in approving the use of blue lights under subsection (5) of this section. OAG 86-67.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court can terminate its discretionary approval under subsection (5) of this section at a later date. OAG 86-87.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A hearing is not necessary to terminate the privilege previously granted to a constable under subsection (5) of this section. OAG 86-67.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A constable may not lawfully equip a vehicle with a fixed or stationary blue light for use in attempting to cause motorists to stop or yield the right-of-way. OAG 91-162.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there is no statute authorizing a constable to equip a vehicle with a fixed or stationary blue light, and no statutory command that a motorist stop or yield the right-of-way to a vehicle using a fixed or stationary blue light, and because of public policy considerations, a constable may not lawfully equip a vehicle with a fixed or stationary blue light.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an arrest is made by a local peace officer for a violation under KRS 189.221, 189.222 or 189.270, the fines recovered as well as the taxes levied must all be sent by the collecting court directly within 30 days after they are imposed and collected. OAG 62-815.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an arrest for a violation of KRS 189.221, 189.222 or 189.270 is made by a state trooper, state highway agent or department of motor transportation (now transportation cabinet) agent, the fines and taxes are treated as any other fines and are sent to the circuit court clerk who reports and forwards them to the state treasury. OAG 62-815.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fine applicable to a violation of an order entered pursuant to KRS 189.230 is found in subsection (2)(b) (now (2)(c)) of this section, and the fact that the county judge (now county judge/executive) in entering that order may have referred to subsection (2)(a) is of no significance. OAG 66-380.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All fines collected under violations of KRS 189.210 and as mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b) and (c) (now (4)(a), (b) and (c)) of this section, after payment of commissions to officers entitled thereto, mandatorily go to the county road fund if the offense is committed in the county. OAG 72-204.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (5) (now (4)) of this section, 15% of fines collected in the quarterly court for violations of KRS 189.210 will go to the county road fund which is the amount available after payment of the requisite percentages of the fines to the commonwealth’s attorney, the county attorney, and the circuit clerk. OAG 72-237.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that a fiscal court cannot agree not to enforce hauling and weight restrictions governing the use of public roads, a contract whereby a coal company would pay a fee to the county, based on the tonnage hauled, to compensate for future expected damages to county roads would be impermissible. OAG 76-170.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As between legislation of broad and general nature on one hand and legislation dealing minutely with specific matter on the other hand, the specific will prevail over the general, and, accordingly, the specific prohibition of this section against imposing of costs in parking violations prevails over the generality of KRS 24A.175, which purports to require payment of costs in all criminal prosecutions upon conviction. OAG 78-328.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where two statutes enacted at the same session are destructively repugnant, the law last enacted must be regarded as the final expression of the legislative will and permitted to prevail; since amended subsection (1) of this section and KRS 24A.175 are destructively repugnant, this section, as the last enacted, prevails.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 189.520(2) and subsection (9) (now subsection (8)) of this section must be construed by the express or literal language contained therein; accordingly, any previous conviction under KRS 189.520(2) may be used for enhancement purposes under subsection (9) (now subsection (8)) of this section. If proof of previous convictions cannot be obtained from the Transportation Cabinet due to a destruction of records which are over five years old or have occurred prior to June 21, 1974, proof by any other means is acceptable so long as introduction of such proof complies with the rules on evidence.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the arresting officer’s testimony sufficiently showed that he made a proper request of the driver to submit to a blood test and the driver’s testimony strongly indicated that he had understood what the officer had asked of him, the findings of the commissioner that the driver had refused the test were neither arbitrary nor capricious. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Cheek, 451 S.W.2d 394, 1970 Ky. LEXIS 384 (Ky. 1970).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was no positive unequivocal “request,” within the meaning of the word, that the motorist should submit to a blood alcohol test, his driver’s license would not be revoked because of mere refusal to submit to the test without such request. Timberlake v. Commonwealth Dep't of Public Safety, 464 S.W.2d 283, 1971 Ky. LEXIS 489 (Ky. 1971).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Driver who requested a blood test when he was stopped for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol, but refused to sign a consent form at the hospital and so did not have the test, should not have had his license revoked, as he did not refuse to have a blood test when requested by an officer to have one. Commonwealth Dep't Public Safety v. Carpenter, 467 S.W.2d 338, 1971 Ky. LEXIS 365 (Ky. 1971).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although defendant orally agreed to take the chemical breath test after his arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, the officer’s testimony that defendant, after knowing of the effect of eating on the administration of the test, deliberately ate a candy mint and defendant’s statement, “God damn your old test,” was sufficient evidence that defendant had refused to take the test. Newman v. Smith, 481 S.W.2d 679, 1972 Ky. LEXIS 269 (Ky. 1972).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of extreme intoxication was not such a condition as to render a person incapable of responding to a definite and positive request to submit to the test unless the person was in a complete drunken stupor or passed out, and in order to comply with former law concerning consent to take a blood alcohol test there must have been a positive and specific request addressed to the licensee to take the test, and, in addition, there must have been a refusal either express or implied by the licensee.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant, as soon as he was apprehended, embarked upon a deliberate program of eating, drinking and smoking designed to frustrate an accurate chemical test, such a course was tantamount to an absolute refusal to submit to the test, regardless of an oral statement to the contrary. Moseley v. Commonwealth, 492 S.W.2d 204, 1973 Ky. LEXIS 511 (Ky. 1973).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a motorist, who was arrested on a charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, was not told by the arresting officer that if he failed to take a breathalyzer test he would automatically lose his driver’s license but was warned that the chances were that he would, the motorist was adequately warned of the consequences of his refusal to take the test. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Tuemler, 526 S.W.2d 305, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 97 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was in physical control of his automobile while under the influence of intoxicating beverages and there was sufficient evidence in the record that defendant refused to take the breathalyzer test after repeated requests and warnings that his refusal could result in revocation of his license, the warnings sufficiently apprised defendant of the effect of his refusal in accordance with former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in the blood and an order suspending defendant’s license for six months was proper. Elkin v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Vehicle Regulation, 646 S.W.2d 45, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 281 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant twice refused to submit to a breathalyzer and was informed of the consequences of such action pursuant to this section, law enforcement officers are not required to administer the breathalyzer at a later time after defendant changes her mind and agrees to submit to the test.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1) of this section is not unconstitutional because it fails to define “substance,” as this section clearly states that if you consume alcohol or any other substance that impairs your driving ability, then you have an obligation to cease driving. Cruse v. Commonwealth, 712 S.W.2d 356, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1122 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) (see now (8) and (9)) of this section, which directs that the minimum sentences for repeat offenders established in the earlier portions of that statute, shall not be subject to suspension, probation, or any other form of conditional release or early discharge, is not a violation of Ky. Const., §§ 27 and 28. Ratliff v. Commonwealth, 719 S.W.2d 445, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1203 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986), limited, Osborne v. Commonwealth, 867 S.W.2d 484, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 151 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Commonwealth v. Ramsey, 920 S.W.2d 526, 1996 Ky. LEXIS 38 (Ky. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The prohibition of this section of operating or being in physical control of a vehicle anywhere in the state while under the influence of alcohol or other substance does not constitute an unreasonable restriction upon the conduct of an individual wherein it violates his constitutional right with regard to privacy and the right to do as he pleases on his own property, for it is not unbridled government decision making, as it is not a law restricting individual freedom without any relation to a valid public interest. Lynch v. Commonwealth, 902 S.W.2d 813, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 55 (Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, KRS 189A.103, and KRS 189A.105 do not violate the separation of powers doctrine, because they do not involve any “ultimate power” of the judiciary, but simply impose conditions on the issuance of warrants. Combs v. Commonwealth, 965 S.W.2d 161, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 33 (Ky. 1998), limited, Commonwealth v. Lopez, 3 S.W.3d 351, 1999 Ky. LEXIS 136 (Ky. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Zero tolerance” provisions pertaining to underage drinking and driving are rationally related to a legitimate state purpose and are based on a valid distinction; therefore, such provisions are valid under the equal protection clauses of the United States and Kentucky Constitutions and do not constitute special legislation in violation of Ky. Const., § 59. Commonwealth v. Howard, 969 S.W.2d 700, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 95 (Ky. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) (now (5)), which operates as a recidivist provision in that it designates an enhanced penalty for each subsequent DUI offense committed within a five-year period, is sufficiently definite that it can be understood by ordinary persons and, therefore, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, notwithstanding the argument that subdivision (4)(c) (now (5)(c)) is incompatible with KRS 189A.105, which requires a person to be informed of the repercussion of refusing to submit to a blood alcohol test. Barker v. Commonwealth, 32 S.W.3d 515, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 111 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (4)(c) (now (5)(c)) is not arbitrary and does not offend Section 2 of the Kentucky Constitution; the defendant failed to establish that those with a blood alcohol level of 0.18 are not seriously impaired or that they do not impose a greater threat to themselves and others than less intoxicated drivers of motor vehicles. Cornelison v. Commonwealth, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. July 7, 2000), aff'd, 52 S.W.3d 570, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 133 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (4)(c) (now (5)(c)) did not subject the defendant to cruel and unusual punishment where he was arrested and convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol on three different occasions within a 10 month period and, for his third conviction, he was sentenced to a one year imprisonment, of which he was required to serve 120 days. Cornelison v. Commonwealth, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. July 7, 2000), aff'd, 52 S.W.3d 570, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 133 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (4)(c) (now (5)(c)) did not violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution where the statute as amended effective July 15, 1998, was in effect one day prior to his second DUI offense and several months prior to his third offense. Cornelison v. Commonwealth, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. July 7, 2000), aff'd, 52 S.W.3d 570, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 133 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (4)(c) (now (5)(c)) does not violate the right to equal protection, notwithstanding that it provides for the treatment of some third time offenders as felons and the treatment of others as misdemeanants. Cornelison v. Commonwealth, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. July 7, 2000), aff'd, 52 S.W.3d 570, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 133 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant did not have standing to argue that KRS 189A.010(2), which applied to test results taken over two (2) hours after cessation of operation or physical control of a motor vehicle, was constitutional. Because her own test result was within the two-hour time period, the section was not relevant or applicable to her case, and she therefore could not have suffered any injury or harm from it. Veltrop v. Commonwealth, 269 S.W.3d 15, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 244 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not violate the requirement of equal protection of the laws due to a provision concerning those who have a prescription for the substance found in their system while operating a motor vehicle, as the classes of individuals were not similarly situated and the statute did not provide a blanket of immunity for those with a prescription.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Epperson v. Commonwealth, 437 S.W.3d 157, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 74 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The words employed in this statute are to be given their ordinary meaning; the language of the statute is both unambiguous and plain and is to be given effect as written. Lynch v. Commonwealth, 902 S.W.2d 813, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 55 (Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statute of the type of this section is not just a road regulation, but a prohibition against an intoxicated person’s driving an automobile, which may be an act dangerous to the public and the driver wherever it may occur, consequently the individual’s right to privacy must yield to the demands of public and personal safety. Lynch v. Commonwealth, 902 S.W.2d 813, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 55 (Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In electing to proceed to trial pursuant to KRS 281A.210 in prosecuting a truck driver, the Commonwealth bound itself to invoke the penalty provision contained in that chapter and did not have the option to impose penalties listed in this section. Beatus v. Commonwealth, 965 S.W.2d 167, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 26 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant cannot rebut a breathalyzer reading of .10 or higher by attempting to prove that the defendant was not actually impaired at the time. Commonwealth v. Mattingly, 98 S.W.3d 865, 2002 Ky. App. LEXIS 2351 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To give effect to the entire statute in KRS 189A.010, prohibiting driving under the influence, to not make any part of it a nullity, and to not create an absurdity in its application, KRS 189A.010(1)(e) did not require all persons under the age of 21 to be charged and convicted solely under KRS 189A.010(1)(e), and a person under the age of 21 with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more could be convicted under KRS 189A.010(1)(a), but the Commonwealth of Kentucky was required to give notice to defendants as to the subsections of KRS 189A.010 that it intended to prove. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, 136 S.W.3d 442, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 140 (Ky. 2004).</p>

Loan v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 588 F. Supp. 2d 770, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98249 (E.D. Ky. 2008), vacated, 370 Fed. Appx. 592, 2010 FED App. 0171N, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 5708 (6th Cir.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a bottle rocket struck a child's eye at the insureds' house, the criminal-act exclusion in their homeowners' insurance policy did not exclude coverage, because the language of the exclusion was ambiguous when applied to possessing and igniting fireworks without a license, and under Kentucky's reasonable expectations doctrine, the insureds would have reasonably expected to be covered for injuries resulting from their possession of the bottle rockets since they were far from the core criminal offenses that an insured would believe to be within the exclusion. Auto Club Property-Casualty Ins. Co. v. B.T., 596 Fed. Appx. 409, 2015 FED App. 0034N, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 670 (6th Cir. Ky. 2015).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Other than the date, time and location of the occurrence, there are but two essential elements: 1) operation of a motor vehicle; 2) while under the influence of alcohol. Hayden v. Commonwealth, 766 S.W.2d 956, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While sometimes actual impaired driving is what calls the officer’s attention to a particular vehicle and justifies the initial stop, that justification can also come from minor violations which may or may not demonstrate impaired driving; consequently, although evidence of impaired driving and/or impaired driving ability is often present in a DUI trial, neither is an essential element of the offense. Hayden v. Commonwealth, 766 S.W.2d 956, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court ruled subsection (4)(d) (now (5)(d)) of this section did not establish a fourth or subsequent offense of driving under the influence which included prior DUI convictions as an element, rather the elements required for violation of this section were the operation or physical control of a motor vehicle coupled with one or more of the levels of impairment outlined in subsection (1). Commonwealth v. Ramsey, 920 S.W.2d 526, 1996 Ky. LEXIS 38 (Ky. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 189A.010(1)(a) creates a criminal offense for operating a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of .10 (now .08) or above, regardless of available evidence that the accused is not under the influence of alcohol. Commonwealth v. Mattingly, 98 S.W.3d 865, 2002 Ky. App. LEXIS 2351 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are only two elements necessary to prove driving under the influence (DUI) per se, and the controlling issue on the second element is whether a defendant has a blood or breath alcohol content of .10 (now .08) or higher; KRS 189A.010 also sets out rebuttable presumptions regarding blood and breath alcohol readings in prosecutions under KRS 189A.010(1)(b) or (d). Commonwealth v. Mattingly, 98 S.W.3d 865, 2002 Ky. App. LEXIS 2351 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was on notice of the subsections of the driving under the influence statute, KRS 189A.010, under which defendant was being prosecuted, as the facts of the case ruled out defendant’s prosecution under any subsection other than KRS 189A.010(1)(a), (b); defendant was over age 21, defendant was charged with driving under the influence, defendant had a blood alcohol reading of 0.88, the citation described defendant’s driving and defendant’s performance on field sobriety tests, and the citation stated that blood and urine samples were not taken. Smith v. Commonwealth, 164 S.W.3d 508, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 279 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the Commonwealth did not provide defendant with notice of the subsections under which KRS 189A.010(1) it intended to proceed, any error was harmless under RCr 9.24; any omission did not prejudice defendant’s opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense, and no likely possibility existed that defendant’s defense or the result of the trial would have been any different had the Commonwealth more specifically informed defendant under which subsections it was proceeding. Smith v. Commonwealth, 164 S.W.3d 508, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 279 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since motor vehicle is not defined in KRS Chapter 189A the term will be construed by the court in accordance with its common and approved usage; therefore, since a farm tractor is a vehicle, has a motor, and is frequently operated on public roads and highways, a farm tractor is a motor vehicle as that term is used in KRS Chapter 189A and the driver of a farm tractor can be prosecuted for DUI under such chapter. Nemeth v. Commonwealth, 944 S.W.2d 871, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 11 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a moped was a “motor vehicle” in accordance with common and approved usage, and because defendant did not show that the legislature intended the definition in KRS 186.010(4) to apply to KRS ch. 189A, defendant was properly found guilty of driving under the influence under KRS 189A.010(1).

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In “driving under the influence” convictions involving a nonresident motor vehicle operator, the Kentucky trial court has no authority to withdraw or revoke a nonresident’s privilege of operating a motor vehicle in Kentucky. The withdrawing or revoking of a nonresident’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Kentucky is the responsibility of the Transportation Cabinet, pursuant to KRS 186.560, 186.565 (now repealed), 186.570, 189A.070, and 189A.080. OAG 85-72.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A Kentucky trial court has no authority to physically take possession of a nonresident operator’s license when he is convicted of driving under the influence. OAG 85-72.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Court is not required to specifically warn a defendant who pleads guilty to a first offense violation of this section, KRS 186.620, or KRS 189A.090 of the possibility of enhancement of punishment, in the event he is found guilty of a subsequent violation of the statute. OAG 89-30.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since subsection (1) (now (2)) of KRS 189A.090 only pertains to violations of this section, the defendant must stand convicted of prior offenses in violation of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants during the period his license was suspended or revoked. Should a prosecutor note that the defendant has been previously convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his license was revoked or suspended based upon another statute, e.g. KRS 186.560 or 186.570, the defendant should be prosecuted under the provisions of KRS 186.620(2) and KRS 186.642(3) (now repealed), which provide enhancement penalties for other types of subsequent revocation and suspension violations. OAG 89-30.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person may be charged with a violation of KRS 189A.090 only if he operates a motor vehicle while his driver’s license is revoked or suspended for violation of this section. If the driver fails to have his driver’s license reinstated after the period of suspension for driving under the influence has elapsed, he should be charged with operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, contrary to KRS 186.620. OAG 90-38.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Home incarceration may be lawfully imposed by a trial court as a penalty for a first, second, or third violation of this section, unless the defendant has been convicted of a violent felony offense within the previous five years, as defined by KRS 532.200(3); a person convicted of a fourth or subsequent violation of this section is not eligible for home incarceration, since the statutes do not permit a court to sentence a felon to home incarceration. OAG 94-49.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mandatory service fee imposed by this section constitutes an additional “fine” or “penalty”; therefore, it is not part of the court costs and subject to be avoided under the provisions of KRS 453.190.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The service fee described in subsections (1) and (3) of this section is constitutional, since it in no way violates Ky. Const., § 51; the 1984 Act (Chapter 165) enacting this section has only one subject, “An Act relating to crimes and punishments”; the service fee is not an appropriation, as envisioned in Ky. Const., § 230 and KRS 41.110, and there is no intent expressed in this section that such fees are to go into the state treasury prior to disbursement. OAG 84-327.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section, by its literal terms, suggests that deposits of the service fees by the court clerks in the state treasury system was not intended. OAG 84-327.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering that the Finance and Transportation Cabinets and the Administrative Office of the Courts, as well as state and local law-enforcement officers, may have some entitlement to share in the distribution of the service fee collected under this section, the actual scheme of allocating and distributing such fees deposited in a special bank account may be equitably and functionally determined through the coordinated regulatory action of the Finance and Transportation Cabinets and the Administrative Office of the Courts; in structuring an equitable, but workable scheme of distribution, they should also be guided by what is deemed to be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of the act. OAG 84-327.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court clerks are authorized to deposit the service fees collected under subsection (1) of this section in special or nontreasury bank accounts, subject to withdrawal or disbursement policies established by the regulatory action, on a coordinated basis, of the Finance and Transportation Cabinets and the Administrative Office of the Courts.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislative intent of this section is to raise the seriousness of the offense as well as the punishment based on the number of times a defendant has committed the offense of operating a vehicle while his license is suspended or revoked. Estis v. Commonwealth, 864 S.W.2d 317, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Nature of Prior Offense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant previously pled guilty to the felony offense of operating on a suspended license, he had judicially admitted the underlying requisites. Consequently, the circuit court unquestionably had jurisdiction to try him, as this was a subsequent offense under Subdivision (2)(c). Toppass v. Commonwealth, 799 S.W.2d 587, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 133 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require that a defendant first be convicted of a Class A misdemeanor for the second such offense before he can be convicted of a Class D felony; he need only be shown to have been previously convicted of two or more violations of subsection (1) of this section; therefore, defendant who was convicted twice under this section, each time for a first offense, could be convicted as a third offender, a Class D felony, when his two previous convictions were both first offenses. Estis v. Commonwealth, 864 S.W.2d 317, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in permitting the driving history record from the Department of Transportation to be used to prove prior revoked or suspended licenses in lieu of prior judgments of convictions or duly authenticated copies thereof. Toppass v. Commonwealth, 799 S.W.2d 587, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 133 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Enhancement of Sentence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although defendant was indicted for his fourth DUI offense on the same date he was also charged in a separate indictment for being a persistent felony offender (PFO), based on his prior felony conviction for operating a motor vehicle (OMV) while his license was suspended or revoked by his third DUI offense, the prior DUI convictions are separate convictions from the OMV on a revoked license charge; thus it was not double enhancement for court to allow the OMV for revoked license charge to enhance the fourth DUI charge for PFO purposes. Corman v. Commonwealth, 908 S.W.2d 122, 1995 Ky. App. LEXIS 82 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is permissible that some prior offenses are used to elevate the charged offense to a felony, while another prior offense is used for persistent felony offender (PFO) enhancement. Newcomb v. Commonwealth, 964 S.W.2d 228, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 15 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unlike the DUI statute, this section does not include a time limitation on the use of prior OSL convictions to enhance subsequent convictions, and the trial court erred when it added the requirement that in order to use a prior conviction for enhancement purposes under this section, the conviction must have occurred within a five-year period. Commonwealth v. Garnett, 8 S.W.3d 573, 1999 Ky. App. LEXIS 35 (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the only prior convictions for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants (DUI), KRS 189A.010, and operating a motor vehicle while license is revoked or suspended for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OSI/DUI), KRS 189A.090, that were used to obtain a persisent felony offender (PFO) enhancement of defendant’s present convictions were not the convictions used to enhance defendant’s present DUI and DUI/OSL convictions to Class D felonies, they were properly used for PFO enhancement under KRS 532.080(6)(b). Parson v. Commonwealth, 144 S.W.3d 775, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 158 (Ky. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in vacating defendant's third conviction for operating a motor vehicle on a DUI-suspended driver's license under the statutory enhancement provision because defendant failed to properly preserve his argument that he was completely denied counsel in his underlying convictions. Commonwealth v. Fugate, 527 S.W.3d 43, 2017 Ky. LEXIS 373 (Ky. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Double Jeopardy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentences for both driving under the influence (DUI), KRS 189A.010(1)(a), and operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended for DUI, KRS 189A.090(1), did not violate his double jeopardy rights under KRS 505.020(2)(a), since being under the influence was not an element of each offense. As each offense required the proof of different elements, sentencing on both convictions was not double jeopardy. Lay v. Commonwealth, 207 S.W.3d 18, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 163 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No double jeopardy violation occurred for convicting defendant for DUI and driving with a suspended license while DUI. Jones v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Unpublished decision: </i>Department of transportation employee testified that, in consecutive suspensions, a suspension for driving under suspension came after a suspension for driving under the influence (DUI), and that defendant’s KRS 189A.070(1)(b) 12-month DUI suspension expired on November 17, 2001, and that only his KRS 189A.090 (suspension for driving while suspended) remained. The trial court erred in determining that defendant’s license was revoked or suspended for DUI under KRS 189A.070(1)(b) at the time of his arrest, because, according to the undisputed testimony of the employee, defendant’s license was no longer revoked or suspended for DUI at the time of the June 14, 2002 incident—even though he had not yet completed a driver’s school and had not had a new license issued to him.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section (conviction for driving while license is suspended or revoked and doubling the period of revocation), KRS 189A.060 (now repealed), KRS 189A.070 (license revocations), and KRS 189A.080 (surrender of suspended or revoked licenses) are written in terms of resident defendants who hold motor vehicle operators’ licenses issued in Kentucky. OAG 85-72.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In “driving under the influence” convictions involving a nonresident motor vehicle operator, the Kentucky trial court has no authority to withdraw or revoke a nonresident’s privilege of operating a motor vehicle in Kentucky. The withdrawing or revoking of a nonresident’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Kentucky is the responsibility of the Transportation Cabinet, pursuant to KRS 186.560, 186.565 (now repealed), 186.570, 189A.070, and 189A.080. OAG 85-72.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A Kentucky trial court has no authority to physically take possession of a nonresident operator’s license when he is convicted of driving under the influence. OAG 85-72.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The district court is not required to specifically warn a defendant who pleads guilty to a first offense violation of this section, KRS 186.620, or KRS 189A.010 of the possibility of enhancement of punishment, in the event he is found guilty of a subsequent violation of the statute. OAG 89-30.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since subsection (1) of this section only pertains to violations of KRS 189A.010, the defendant must stand convicted of prior offenses in violation of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants during the period his license was suspended or revoked. Should a prosecutor note that the defendant has been previously convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his license was revoked or suspended based upon another statute, e.g. KRS 186.560 or 186.570, the defendant should be prosecuted under the provisions of KRS 186.620(2) and KRS 186.642(3) (now repealed), which provide enhancement penalties for other types of subsequent revocation and suspension violations. OAG 89-30.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person may be charged with a violation of this section only if he operates a motor vehicle while his driver’s license is revoked or suspended for violation of KRS 189A.010. If the driver fails to have his driver’s license reinstated after the period of suspension for driving under the influence has elapsed, he should be charged with operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, contrary to KRS 186.620.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, KRS 189A.010, and KRS 189A.105 do not violate the separation of powers doctrine, because they do not involve any “ultimate power” of the judiciary, but simply impose conditions on the issuance of warrants.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Implied consent law permitted the police to take a blood test of a driver who was unconscious; however, the warrantless testing was permissible only if the police had probable cause to believe that the unconscious driver had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. If the police lacked probable cause and only took the blood test because the accident in which the driver was involved resulted in fatalities, then the testing violated the Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The implied consent law in subsection one of former KRS 186.565 (now repealed) specifically stated that operators of motor vehicles are deemed to have given consent to a breathalyzer test. The entire purpose of the implied consent law was to control the number of persons driving motor vehicles while intoxicated. There is no statute that implies the operator of a nonmotor vehicle must submit to a breathalyzer test; therefore, subsection (7) would have been meaningless unless it also applied to motor vehicles. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet v. Tarter, 802 S.W.2d 944, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 141 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this section are based on the public policy determined by the legislature that an individual driving on the highways of Kentucky has given implied consent to the performance of blood, breath and/or urine tests in the event that the individual is suspected of driving a vehicle under the influence. Beach v. Commonwealth, 927 S.W.2d 826, 1996 Ky. LEXIS 60 (Ky. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By virtue of this section, one who operates a motor vehicle consents to a test of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration. The phrase “no person shall be compelled” in KRS 189A.105 could not rationally have been intended to contradict the consent provisions of this section. A more reasonable interpretation of the language used is that one who refuses will not be physically forced to submit to a chemical test. It does not mean that such person has a lawful right to refuse such testing. Commonwealth v. Wirth, 936 S.W.2d 78, 1996 Ky. LEXIS 90 (Ky. 1996).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsections (1) and (5) of this section do not require that a police officer must first offer a DUI suspect a breath test before asking him or her to submit to a blood test; trial judge properly refused to suppress results of blood test.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is reasonable to interpret the purposes of the statute and regulations concerning the credentials of the individual drawing blood as giving a presumption of regularity; it is presumed that those individuals mentioned in the statute and regulations will perform the procedures properly, but they are not the only persons in the world who can draw blood accurately. Matthews v. Commonwealth, 44 S.W.3d 361, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 24 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss a driving under the influence charge because, while defendant was certainly free to express an opinion as to his testing preference, the police officer had statutory authority to determine which of the three tests to utilize, and, even if defendant asserted a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, which he did not, he lacked the requisite standing where an actual blood test was never performed due to his refusal to consent.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of defendant's motion to suppress the results of defendant's initial blood test was appropriate because when defendant requested that an independent test be performed at a different hospital, the deputy sheriff who arrested defendant made sufficient efforts to facilitate such a test at a different hospital in another town, but was unable to facilitate such a test because of the low staffing level for the sheriff's department on that night.

Ann. § 189A.105(2)(a)(3) was clear in that a person's right to request an independent blood test arose only after he or she submitted to all tests an officer requests, and the fact that defendant agreed to submit to a more invasive blood test was irrelevant.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “request” in former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in the blood while operating a vehicle in Kentucky meant to demand rather than to offer.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the words used by the officers were calculated to convey to the arrested driver the thought that to take the test was a privilege being offered him rather than a waiver of protection on the giving of evidence against his interests, there was no “request” within the meaning of former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in blood of motorist.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A sworn report by the arresting officer was mandatory to begin the license revocation process pursuant to former law that provided for revocation of driver’s license for refusing consent to test alcohol in blood. While the swearing need not be the formal procedure used in courts to swear in witnesses, there should have been a positive statement by the officer that the report contains the truth and was sufficient so long as the affiant appeared before the notary and signed the document or acknowledged the signature in the presence of a notary while being aware that the affidavit was to be accepted and processed as a sworn document. Therefore, where the officer had failed to sign the affidavit in the presence of a notary the Transportation Cabinet had no authority to hold a hearing or issue a final order on defendant’s license revocation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s combative and belligerent conduct on the date of her arrest for driving under the influence did not amount to a refusal to submit to an intoxilyzer examination because the reading of the implied consent warning was mandatory under KRS 189A.105(2)(a); the officers did not do so even though defendant was not required to listen to the warning. Commonwealth v. Rhodes, 308 S.W.3d 720, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 63 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly reversed the district court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the results of an intoxilyzer test because the excessive cost of the blood test charged by a medical school deprived defendant of the opportunity to challenge the results in a meaningful fashion and hindered his fundamental right to due process to develop and present any exculpatory evidence in his own defense where the Legislature afforded him—in mandatory language—the right to the test.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Commonwealth v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in granting defendant’s motion to suppress her blood test following her arrest for DUI as involuntary because the information to be given and the warnings about the consequences of refusing or submitting to a test were statutorily provided, which included the doubling of mandatory minimum sentences for refusing consent, and defendant validly offered her consent after being read the implied consent warnings.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The implication of KRS Chapter 335B is that a licensing authority should look beyond the mere record of a felony conviction and should not arbitrarily refuse all former felons, although the chapter does not expressly order the authority to consider former felons the better policy is to review each case on its merits and not to have a policy of arbitrary rejection.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a contract case, there was no error in a default judgment that limited post-judgment interest on a retail installment contract to 12 percent per annum because a purchaser did not agree to the accrual of interest at any rate, much less at a rate in excess of the statutory rate; the purchaser agreed only to buy a vehicle at a price determined by adding the cost of the vehicle if she had paid cash and the time price differential. Moreover, the court could not deviate from the 12 percent rate because the claim here was for liquidated damages. Serv. Fin. Co. v. Ware, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 47 (Ky. Ct.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Retail installment sales of mobile homes would not fall within the ambit of KRS chapter 190 which sets out the provisions for installment contract sales for motor vehicles whose cash sale price is $5,000 or less, because mobile homes do not fall within the category of motor vehicles as defined in subsection (4) of this section, and are therefore covered by the provisions of KRS 371.210 et seq. OAG 80-51.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since mobile homes fall within the broad definition of motor vehicles in subsection (4) of this section and do not fall within any of the exemptions listed in subsection (4) of this section, if the cash price of a mobile home is $5,000 or less, the mobile home may be financed under the provisions of KRS 190.090 to 190.140; but see OAG 80-51. OAG 80-111.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the cash sale price of a stationary mobile home is $5,000 or less, the provisions of the motor vehicle retail instalment sales act, KRS 190.090 to 190.140 apply; where the cash price of stationary mobile homes exceeds $5,000, the provisions of the Instalment Sales Contracts Act, KRS 371.210 to 371.330, apply but see OAG 80-51. OAG 80-111.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 360.150 excludes manufactured home financing transactions which provide for a fixed rate of interest payable in substantially equal successive installments over a fixed term; these financing transactions fall under the statutory requirements of the Motor Vehicle Retail Installment Sales Act because they would fall under the broad definition of “motor vehicle” as contained in subsection (4) of this section. Since there is no longer a ceiling on the cash price sale of such transactions, the Motor Vehicle Retail Installment Sales Act would be applicable in all manufactured home financing transactions where there was a fixed rate of interest.
