<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff in an action to enforce a lien on land that was not indivisible stated the existence of a lien held by another, and made the other lienholder a defendant, and asked for a sale of the land to satisfy both liens, and the other lienholder filed a cross petition asserting his lien, process was not required to issue on the cross petition in order to authorize a sale of the land to satisfy both liens. Griffith v. Bluegrass Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 108 Ky. 713, 57 S.W. 486, 22 Ky. L. Rptr. 391, 1900 Ky. LEXIS 94 (Ky. 1900).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where decedent’s administrator brought an action to settle estate and to sell real estate, including a tract of land conveyed to the decedent and his wife jointly, upon which a vendor’s lien was retained and vendor and the widow were made parties to the action and served with process and petition set up the lien of the vendor and then vendor filed a petition asserting his lien but no process thereon was served on the widow and land covered by the deed was ordered sold but did not bring enough to satisfy the debt. Several years later the widow brought a suit to set aside the commissioner’s deed and to recover a half interest in the property since the widow was served with process on the original petition, she was before the court for the purposes of the sale, and the judgment and other proceedings barred her right of recovery, it not being necessary that she should have been served with process on the petition of the vendor, since his lien was set up in the original petition and the vendor did not seek a personal judgment against the widow. Roberts v. Roberts, 180 Ky. 629, 203 S.W. 523, 1918 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 1918).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A summons on a pleading filed by a lienholder, and which was made a cross petition against the defendants, was necessary although no personal judgment was sought, where the cross plaintiff was not made a party to the original suit. Allen v. Sweeney, 185 Ky. 94, 213 S.W. 217, 1919 Ky. LEXIS 245 (Ky. 1919).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it is true that a plaintiff in a cross petition must have a summons executed upon the defendant in the cross petition in order to obtain a person judgment, a judgment which gave the defendant lienholders only a lien upon property rather than a personal judgment against the property owners is valid. Lorton v. Ashbrook, 220 Ky. 830, 295 S.W. 1027, 1927 Ky. LEXIS 614 (Ky. 1927).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to foreclose a mortgage lien, where intervening tax lienholders made claim to fund arising from the foreclosure sale but did not ask for personal judgment, summons was unnecessary on the petitions of the intervenors setting up their claim to the fund. Louisville Title Co. v. White Const. Co., 250 Ky. 212, 62 S.W.2d 795, 1933 Ky. LEXIS 674 (Ky. 1933).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a lienholder was made a defendant in an action by the wife against her husband to determine the ownership of certain realty, issuance of summons on the lienholder’s cross petition for sale of the property was not a prerequisite to the lienholder’s right to have the property sold and to receive its portion of the proceeds, since the cross petition did not ask for a personal judgment against the husband. Noel v. Noel, 307 Ky. 128, 210 S.W.2d 140, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 1032 (Ky. 1947).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4.5. Standing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mortgagee had first-party standing to contest an agreed judgment between a mortgagor and a purchaser of the mortgagor’s delinquent property tax liens because the mortgagee was a lienholder under KRS 426.006 and would suffer direct financial injury as the tax lien was superior under KRS 134.420(3); the amount of the tax lien was increased by the included attorney’s fees under KRS 134.452, which the mortgagee contended were unreasonable. Tax Ease Lien Invs. 1 v. Commonwealth Bank &amp; Trust, 384 S.W.3d 141, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 142 (Ky. 2012).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The meaning of the term “defendant” in KRS 426.530 refers to the owner of the property; junior mortgagees or lienholders are not included in the class of those entitled to redeem under KRS 426.530. Kirklevington Assoc., Ltd. v. Kirklevington North Assoc., Ltd., 848 S.W.2d 453, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 35 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The failure to make a lienholder a party to a suit to enforce a lien, and to bring him before the court, is a reversible error. Fisher v. Evans, 175 Ky. 300, 194 S.W. 361, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 333 (Ky. 1917). See also Fisher v. Maxwell Inv. Co., 206 Ky. 24, 266 S.W. 902, 1924 Ky. LEXIS 272 (Ky. 1924).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to enforce a vendor’s lien, all lienholders should be made parties in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits and a sacrifice of property and to insure fairness in the sale and invite competition in the bidding. Dallas v. First Nat'l Bank, 200 Ky. 826, 255 S.W. 835, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 200 (Ky. 1923).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to allow a mortgagor to file a separate answer, counterclaim and cross petition against a purchaser of part of the mortgaged property who had asked to become a party to a foreclosure suit where the mortgagor asserted that the purchaser had not paid any money for the land because in this case a complete adjudication as to all liens against the property required that all lienholders be made parties. Barnett v. Howard, 267 Ky. 316, 102 S.W.2d 44, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 321 (Ky. 1937).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section it is necessary to make a lienholder a party, but it is not incumbent to set out with particularity his lien. Jones v. Chipps, 296 Ky. 245, 176 S.W.2d 408, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 140 (Ky. 1943).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires one seeking to enforce a lien to name other lienholders as defendants in the action; it is the responsibility of the defendant-lienholders to protect their interests in the property. Owens v. First Commonwealth Bank, 706 S.W.2d 414, 1985 Ky. App. LEXIS 707 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bank was given proper notice that a mortgagee had commenced a foreclosure action and that the bank had been named as a defendant as required by KRS 426.006 where a copy of the complaint and a civil summons were served on a local branch manager of the bank; the bank was served in accordance with CR 4.04(5) as it was reasonable to presume that the branch manager would know what to do with a civil summons served upon her as bank manager. PNC Bank, N.A. v. Citizens Bank of N. Ky., Inc., 139 S.W.3d 527, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 323 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to assert a mortgage lien upon real property which was dismissed by agreement between plaintiff and the mortgagor, and then was subsequently reinstated by petition, the court determined that a junior mortgagee should have been made a party to the petition reinstating the action, but the failure to do so did not prejudice his rights in the property. Karl v. Conner, 97 S.W. 1111, 30 Ky. L. Rptr. 238 (1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a lienholder brings suit for foreclosure of his lien and fails to make the holders of delinquent tax liens parties and the tax lienholders intervene before confirmation of the sale or distribution of the proceeds, the court may properly order the tax liens paid from the proceeds of the sale. Louisville Title Co. v. White Const. Co., 250 Ky. 212, 62 S.W.2d 795, 1933 Ky. LEXIS 674 (Ky. 1933).</p>

McKibben v. Worthington's Ex'rs, 103 Ky. 356, 45 S.W. 233, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 61, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 1898).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, on mortgage foreclosure, the owners of prior mortgages filed no answer asserting any lien, but were erroneously given a personal judgment against the mortgagor, and the priority of their mortgages was established, but the court subsequently made an order that they should not receive any of the proceeds until an answer was filed, the error was unavailable to the mortgagor. James v. Webb, 71 S.W. 526, 24 Ky. L. Rptr. 1382 (1903).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment finding a senior mortgagee’s lien subordinate was invalid where in an action by a junior mortgagee to foreclosure there were no averments showing that the first mortgage had been paid or discharged or that it was inferior to the second mortgage even though the petition did call upon the senior mortgage holder to assert her claim or be barred and the senior mortgage holder failed to answer. Bank of Tollesboro v. W. T. Raleigh Co., 218 Ky. 516, 291 S.W. 1039, 1926 Ky. LEXIS 121 (Ky. 1926).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff sought to attach money in the hands of a bus company transferee in order to satisfy a personal injury judgment the trial court could not foreclose the interest of mortgagees of the company in the same fund merely because they had failed to answer and they could assert their liens as long as the action was pending. Safety Motor Coach Co. v. Maddin's Adm'x, 266 Ky. 459, 99 S.W.2d 183, 1936 Ky. LEXIS 673 (Ky. 1936).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was necessary for a second lienholder to answer and set out his lien in order to entitle the first lienholder to obtain a decree of sale to satisfy the liens against the property, although the second lienholder would not be allowed to receive or withdraw any of the proceeds of sale until he showed his right thereto by answer and cross petition. Jones v. Chipps, 296 Ky. 245, 176 S.W.2d 408, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 140 (Ky. 1943).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>12. Satisfaction of Junior Lien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A valid sale may be made to satisfy a junior lien which is due, although a prior lien thereon is not, if the liens are held by different persons and the sale is subject to prior lien. Fisher v. Maxwell Inv. Co., 206 Ky. 24, 266 S.W. 902, 1924 Ky. LEXIS 272 (Ky. 1924). See also Fisher v. Evans, 175 Ky. 300, 194 S.W. 361, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 333 (Ky. 1917).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a provision of the secured party’s security agreement with the debtor enabled it to pay liens and taxes on the collateral and charge same to debtor, the secured party’s security interest was extinguished and provisions of the security agreement became inoperative upon sale of the collateral at the judicial sale. Therefore, the secured party could not gratuitously pay the mechanic’s lienholder and charge same to the debtor. Owens v. First Commonwealth Bank, 706 S.W.2d 414, 1985 Ky. App. LEXIS 707 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>13. Void Sale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judgment for the sale of property to satisfy a lien asserted by cross petition upon which summons was not issued is void as to the cross petition plaintiff, where he was merely made a defendant to the original petition, without any statement as to whether he had a lien, and it is erroneous as to the original plaintiff, though he was adjudged to have a prior lien, and the property has not sold for more than enough to satisfy his claim. Mitchell v. Fidelity Trust &amp; Safety-Vault Co., 47 S.W. 446, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 713, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 256 (Ky. Ct. App. 1898).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to enforce a mortgage the statute of limitations as to liens ceased to run where the defendant filed a cross petition asserting an improvement lien even though no summons was issued on the cross petition. Ideal Sav., Loan &amp; Bldg. Ass'n v. Park Hills, 281 Ky. 571, 136 S.W.2d 748, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 64 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The filing of a cross petition seeking merely the enforcement of a lien within the prescribed period of limitation was sufficient to stop the running of the statute of limitations although no summons was issued on the cross petition. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. Board of Regents, 287 Ky. 439, 152 S.W.2d 581, 1941 Ky. LEXIS 514 (Ky. 1941).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court improperly confirmed a judicial sale without making it subject to a senior mortgage because, while an assignee and its predecessor failed to bring their claim in the foreclosure proceedings initiated by a junior mortgagee and therefore had a default judgment entered against them, the assignee’s presentation of its claim prior to the judicial sale was sufficient to prevent its senior mortgage from being extinguished by the junior mortgagee’s foreclosure action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mortg.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In Kentucky creditor obtained lien upon debtor’s property by delivery of execution to sheriff and this lien was as absolute before levy as it was afterwards. Lessee of Waller v. Best, 44 U.S. 111, 11 L. Ed. 518, 1845 U.S. LEXIS 426 (U.S. 1845) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lien of first execution may be prolonged and given uninterrupted continuity by delivery of successive executions to officer before, or on same day as, return or expiration of prior execution. Hood v. Winsatt, 40 Ky. 208, 1841 Ky. LEXIS 12 (Ky. 1841) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy, sale and conveyance connect themselves with delivery of execution to officer so as to form single transaction, which as regards passage of title from debtor, dates from first act which gave lien. Halley v. Oldham, 44 Ky. 233, 1844 Ky. LEXIS 110 (Ky. 1844) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of statutory provision making execution bind estate of defendant from time of its delivery to officer is to create lien for its payment from that time. C. T. C. Inv. Co. v. Daniel Boone Coal Corp., 58 F.2d 305, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2045 (D. Ky. 1931).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The difference between the lien before levy and that after levy would seem to be that in the one case it is general and in the other it is specific. C. T. C. Inv. Co. v. Daniel Boone Coal Corp., 58 F.2d 305, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2045 (D. Ky. 1931).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Execution upon judgment in action by state against sheriff and surety on his bond created lien on surety’s property only from time execution was delivered to officer, and hence was inferior to mortgage previously given by surety, notwithstanding action had been commenced before mortgage was given, where state elected to take execution instead of adjudication of lien under KRS 135.100. Johnson v. Catron, 108 Ky. 568, 57 S.W. 13, 22 Ky. L. Rptr. 275, 1900 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 1900).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lien was created when executions were placed in the hands of an officer. Webster v. Industrial Acceptance Corp., 234 Ky. 613, 28 S.W.2d 959, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1930).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section a lien was created on the property of the execution debtor at the time the execution was issued by the clerk and this lien continued so long as the execution remained alive in the hands of the sheriff. McKenzie v. Commonwealth, 373 S.W.2d 595, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 166 (Ky. 1963).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lien is not perfected unless the officer made a levy and took actual or constructive possession, or exercised some control over the property. W. E. Stephens Mfg. Co. v. Miller, 429 S.W.2d 384, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 746 (Ky. 1968).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where levy was made upon debtor’s personal property and indorsed upon execution, lien which arose when execution was delivered to officer continued to exist notwithstanding officer neglected to have property appraised and inventoried. Richart v. Goodpaster, 116 Ky. 637, 76 S.W. 831, 25 Ky. L. Rptr. 889, 1903 Ky. LEXIS 240 (Ky. 1903).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where state court, by delivery of execution to sheriff, had acquired jurisdiction over defendant’s property prior to appointment of receiver for defendant by federal court, receiver committed wrongful act entitling execution creditor to have receiver pay amount due on execution, when receiver, before he or sheriff had actually taken possession of defendant’s property, notified sheriff not to levy and thus prevented collection of execution. C. T. C. Inv. Co. v. Daniel Boone Coal Corp., 58 F.2d 305, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2045 (D. Ky. 1931).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lien obtained against a bankrupt by the levy of execution on his property is not automatically nullified by an adjudication in bankruptcy and in the absence of an order issued by the bankruptcy court nullifying the lien created by this section, staying the sale or enjoining the proceedings under the execution, there is no legal excuse not to proceed with the sale. McKenzie v. Commonwealth, 373 S.W.2d 595, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 166 (Ky. 1963).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy of execution upon land gave execution creditor prior lien over rights acquired under partnership agreement between debtors and another, whereby coal rights in land were acquired by the other man who subsequently assigned them to third party, where neither partnership agreement nor assignment was recorded pursuant to KRS 382.270. Mann Bros. v. Ball, 230 Ky. 129, 18 S.W.2d 946, 1929 Ky. LEXIS 27 (Ky. 1929).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where execution was delivered to officer with directions to hold it for further instructions, and chattel mortgage was given by debtor while execution was so held, sale under subsequent levy of execution was properly made subject to chattel mortgage. Hood v. Pope, 233 Ky. 749, 26 S.W.2d 1043, 1930 Ky. LEXIS 656 (Ky. 1930).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Delay of about two years in enforcing levy of execution upon land should be treated as waiver or abandonment of it as against one who acquired land even with knowledge of the levy. Cook v. Clemens, 87 Ky. 566, 9 S.W. 820, 10 Ky. L. Rptr. 604, 1888 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 1888) (decided under prior law). See Deposit Bank of Cynthia v. Berry's Adm'r, 65 Ky. 236, 1867 Ky. LEXIS 63 (Ky. 1867); Owens v. Patteson, 45 Ky. 488, 1846 Ky. LEXIS 43 (Ky. 1846) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy of execution and its lien were not destroyed by delay of about four years in enforcing it, where about two years after sheriff returned execution without releasing it, creditor complied with subsequently enacted KRS 382.450 by filing notice, which was constructive notice to purchaser who bought the land about two years after its filing. Park v. McReynolds, 111 Ky. 651, 64 S.W. 517, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 894, 1901 Ky. LEXIS 239 (Ky. 1901).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although prior to adoption of KRS 382.450 requiring filing of notice of issuance and levy of execution, delay in acting upon execution of nearly three years between its issuance and acquirement of debtor’s land by bona fide purchaser would have defeated execution creditor’s rights, since adoption of that law execution creditor need not be as diligent as formerly. Donacher v. Tafferty, 147 Ky. 337, 144 S.W. 13, 1912 Ky. LEXIS 231 (Ky. 1912).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lien of execution was not released by delay of nonaction thereon for nearly three years between its issuance and time when bona fide purchaser acquired debtor’s land, where execution creditor had filed notice pursuant to KRS 382.450 that execution had been issued. Donacher v. Tafferty, 147 Ky. 337, 144 S.W. 13, 1912 Ky. LEXIS 231 (Ky. 1912).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Execution created lien upon real estate, good as against purchasers, upon delivery to sheriff, provided lis pendens notice was filed pursuant to KRS 382.450. Low v. Skaggs, 105 S.W. 439, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 1292 (1907).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At moment when execution against debtor was issued and delivered to sheriff, it became lien on life estate of debtor in land and bound subsequent purchaser who concededly had notice of it. Roby v. Arterburn, 269 Ky. 816, 108 S.W.2d 873, 1937 Ky. LEXIS 672 (Ky. 1937).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where purchaser of oil and gas rights in land had actual knowledge of judgment and of judgment creditor’s intention to enforce it by execution, in addition to lis pendens notice, the conveyance should not operate to defeat creditor’s attachment lien on the land including all oil, gas, and other minerals therein. Fannin's Ex'r v. Haney, 283 Ky. 68, 140 S.W.2d 630, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 277 (Ky. 1940).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where creditor had delivered executions to sheriff which had been returned unsatisfied, execution against same debtor which another creditor delivered to sheriff should have been satisfied before still another execution which first mentioned creditor later delivered to sheriff was paid, since first mentioned executions, which had been returned unsatisfied and were extinct, did not preserve lien in favor of first mentioned creditor. Tabb v. Harris, 7 Ky. 29, 1815 Ky. LEXIS 25 (Ky. 1815) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lien created by execution in an officer’s hands for levy ceased whenever the right to levy ceased or was voluntarily suspended by the creditor, therefore, a lien ceased if the execution was returned and a day passed before the delivery of another execution to an officer. Hood v. Winsatt, 40 Ky. 208, 1841 Ky. LEXIS 12 (Ky. 1841) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where return showed that parties had agreed that execution be stayed, the levy ceased and the property was released from its lien, since the execution of the process was stopped and continuation of levy would be inconsistent with ending the execution. Eldridge v. Chambers, 47 Ky. 411, 1848 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1848) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Execution abates by death of execution creditor after it has been delivered to sheriff, but before it has been levied or replevied, unless law gives debtor privilege of replevying debt and he should not be deprived of right by death of creditor to whom he would give bond. Wagnon v. M'Coy's Ex'r, 5 Ky. 198, 1810 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1810) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Title vested in sheriff under levy in creditor’s lifetime was not divested by creditor’s subsequent death before sale, although levy might have been avoided by execution debtor, if judgment was revived in name of creditor’s personal representative so that debtor could give replevin or sale bond sheriff could proceed, in name of new party, to sell the property. Kennedy v. Holloway's Adm'rs, 29 Ky. 321, 1831 Ky. LEXIS 179 (Ky. 1831) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In levying upon personal property, officer may take possession of property or he may leave it in possession of debtor or other person who holds it as bailee of officer. McBurnie v. Overstreet, 47 Ky. 300, 1847 Ky. LEXIS 172 (Ky. 1847). See Richardson &amp; Letcher v. Bartley, 41 Ky. 328, 1842 Ky. LEXIS 40 (Ky. 1842) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although officer may levy on as much property as he deems necessary to satisfy execution, yet he should exercise ordinary care to ascertain value of property levied on and should not levy on property having peculiar valuable quality, as blood in horses or cows, when levy on less valuable property would suffice. Vance v. Vanarsdale, 64 Ky. 504, 1866 Ky. LEXIS 178 (Ky. 1866) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy on movable property put thing into officer’s possession either actually or constructively and invested him with special property enabling him to maintain trespass or trover.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy on personal property was valid, where execution debtor surrendered certain property to sheriff, and sheriff indorsed levy on execution, describing the property and stating that it was given to him by debtor, although the property was not present, was never seen by sheriff, and remained in debtor’s possession. Carlisle v. Wathen, 78 Ky. 365, 1880 Ky. LEXIS 21 (Ky. 1880) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reason for rule that to constitute valid levy upon personal property, officer must do some act which would amount to trespass except for protection of the process is that the parties, especially the defendant, should know that levy has been made and that the property levied on should be known.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The general rule was that it was necessary to validity of levy upon personal property that officer should do some act which would be a trespass but for the process.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Levy on land did not give officer possession and consequently he had no special property therein as he had by levy on movable property.

If the land sold had been given up by the defendant to the officer for levy and sale and the sale is set aside, the court shall render judgment against the defendant for ten percent (10%) damages upon the amount of the execution, including interest and cost.</p>

The remedy of plaintiff was to subject the land upon which the debt was sued to a lien. Boyer v. Lincoln, 11 Ky. Op. 437, 3 Ky. L. Rptr. 537, 1882 Ky. LEXIS 133 (Ky. Ct. App. Jan. 24, 1882).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On a return of “no property” plaintiffs in the execution filed a bill against the defendant for the discovery and subjection of property unknown to the plaintiffs. This bill did not operate as a lien until the discovery was made by the filing of the answer. Such lien, however, is inferior to lien of other judgment creditors who filed a similar action in the meantime, charging that defendant had a vendible interest in certain described land, and prayed for the subjection of it to their debt. Ward's Adm'rs v. Robinson, 64 Ky. 294, 1866 Ky. LEXIS 142 (Ky. 1866) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petition, in action under this section, praying for a general order of attachment, but failing to describe any particular property sought to be subjected to judgment debt, is insufficient to create a lis pendens lien, since a lis pendens can only be asserted in a suit in rem, prosecuted with reasonable diligence, for relief against specific property which is identified by the proceedings to which proceedings the other claimant is an actual party. Morton v. Jones, 136 Ky. 797, 125 S.W. 247, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 544 (Ky. 1910).</p>

Huffman v. Thomas, 63 Ky. 105, 1865 Ky. LEXIS 20 (Ky. 1865) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action on a return of “no property” where the proceeding is to subject property specifically described, no attachment levy is necessary to give a lien as against the defendant in the action. In such case the main object of the action being to subject the property in controversy, and it being sufficiently described in order for identification, an equitable lien is created as against the debtor by the filing of the petition and the service of summons. Murphy v. Cochran's Trustee, 80 Ky. 239, 3 Ky. L. Rptr. 727, 1882 Ky. LEXIS 44 (Ky. Ct. App. 1882).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where suit in equity under this section described the property subject to bank’s claim, and those who claimed to be the owners of the property were made defendants and were actually summoned, such action creates a lis pendens lien upon the property sought to be subjected, without any attachment, or any indorsement on the summons, of the object of the action. Caldwell v. Deposit Bank, 109 Ky. 197, 58 S.W. 589, 22 Ky. L. Rptr. 684, 1900 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1900).</p>

If that occurs, i.e., if he satisfies such costs by merely being in jail, or working in jail, it means that the arresting officer would not recover his arresting fees because the county is not responsible for paying the costs, including arresting fees and thus the arresting fees will go unpaid.

<p class="p6">The plaintiff in an action to enforce a lien on real property shall state in his petition the liens, if any, which are held thereon by others, and make the holders defendants; and no sale of the property shall be ordered by the court prejudicial to the rights of the holders of any of the liens, and when it appears from the petition or otherwise, that several debts are secured by one (1) lien, or by liens of equal rank, and they are all due at the commencement of the action, or become so before judgment, the court shall order the sale for the pro rata satisfaction of all of them, but if, in such case, the debts be owned by different persons and be not all due, the court shall not order a sale of the property until they all mature. If all such liens be held by the same party, the court may order a sale of enough of the property to pay the debts then due, unless it appear that it is not susceptible of advantageous division, or that, for some other reason, the sale would cause a sacrifice thereof, or seriously prejudice the interests of the defendants, but the holder of a prior lien may enforce the same when the debt thereby secured is due, notwithstanding the existence of inferior liens, whether the debts secured thereby are due or not; and the holder of an inferior lien, when the debt thereby secured is due, may enforce the same by a sale of land subject to a prior lien or liens thereon, where the debt or debts secured thereby are not yet due.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to foreclose a vendor’s lien securing two notes, both owned by the plaintiff, one of which was not due, instead of ordering a sale of all or part of the land to satisfy a part only of the plaintiff’s debts, reserving a lien and consequent encumbrance on the land in his favor for the residue of the indebtedness, the court should have simply directed a sale of enough of the land to pay the debts and costs then adjudged, leaving the remaining note to its lien on the remaining portion of the land. Emison v. Risque, 72 Ky. 24, 1872 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 1872) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to enforce a lien for purchase money upon a tract of land, where there are no other liens known to the plaintiff, the better practice is to state that fact in the petition. Baird v. Prewitt, 158 Ky. 793, 166 S.W. 771, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 726 (Ky. 1914).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiff recovered judgment, had its attachment and levy sustained, and then took no action for three (3) years when it brought a new action to determine the rights of the judgment debtor’s transferee and the priority between its lien and a lien executed after the judgment, the court properly dismissed the action, because this question should have been submitted to the court through amendments of the pleadings in the original action. C. I. T. Corp. v. House, 258 Ky. 86, 79 S.W.2d 392, 1935 Ky. LEXIS 116 (Ky. 1935).</p>

Board of Councilmen v. Herndon's Adm'r, 133 Ky. 583, 118 S.W. 347, 1909 Ky. LEXIS 200 (Ky. 1909).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the original action by city for the recovery of taxes was brought prior to the time when taxes for the current year were collectible by suit, it was proper for the city to file a supplemental petition setting out taxes accruing after the filing of the original petition and asking that its lien be enforced. Thornton's Unknown Heirs v. Dayton, 216 Ky. 543, 288 S.W. 310, 1926 Ky. LEXIS 967 (Ky. 1926).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action by the holder of mortgage note and tax bills to collect them and to foreclose lien securing them, it was not erroneous for the trial court to order a sale of the encumbered property before passing on the validity of inferior liens whose owners filed their answers after the case had been submitted to judgment. Cox v. Stamper, 221 Ky. 745, 299 S.W. 723, 1927 Ky. LEXIS 811 (Ky. 1927).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a prior mortgage lien and a junior mortgage lien exist upon the same tract of land and are owned by different persons, and the junior lien has matured, a sale of the land or a sufficiency of it, subject to the prior lien, may be adjudged to satisfy the junior lien, although the prior lien has not matured. Fisher v. Evans, 175 Ky. 300, 194 S.W. 361, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 333 (Ky. 1917).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where real estate is sold to enforce a junior lien, the thing that is sold is the debtor’s equity in the realty, subject to the prior lien; the property must be appraised as a whole and the purchaser, in order to cut off the debtor’s right of redemption and obtain a deed, must bid at least two thirds of the value of the debtor’s equity as computed by deducting the amount of the prior lien from the total appraised value. Hardwick v. Fitzpatrick, 279 Ky. 53, 129 S.W.2d 1006, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 232 (Ky. 1939).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court improperly confirmed a judicial sale without making it subject to a senior mortgage because, while an assignee and its predecessor failed to bring their claim in the foreclosure proceedings initiated by a junior mortgagee and therefore had a default judgment entered against them, the assignee’s presentation of its claim prior to the judicial sale was sufficient to prevent its senior mortgage from being extinguished by the junior mortgagee’s foreclosure action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mortg.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where one party to an action held a mortgage lien on a stock of merchandise and upon three tracts of land for three notes aggregating about $950, of which all except $676.78 was controverted, and another party held a lien on one of the tracts for $150, it was error for the court to order a sale of the land until after the trial of the issue controverting a portion of the lien debt, since it did not appear from the pleadings that enough of the land could be sold at that time to pay the uncontroverted claim without impairing the value of the remainder by causing a sacrifice thereof. Rowlett v. Harris, 121 Ky. 811, 90 S.W. 562, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 780, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 264 (Ky. 1906).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to enforce a vendor’s lien when some of the purchase money notes are not due, if it appears that the land is not susceptible of advantageous division, the court should not order a sale of it, or any part of it, until the maturity of all notes, although all are held by the same person.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Debtor’s claim that the retroactive applicability of subsection (4) of this section was a taking of property without due process of law was without merit, where under the applicable state law the household goods in question were not exempt at the time the lien was created on May 16, 1979, nor were they exempt pursuant to the state’s statutory exemption scheme on May 3, 1983, when the debtor’s petition in bankruptcy was filed.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 427.010(2)(a) was a Kentucky garnishment statute, limited to pre-bankruptcy actions by creditors; once debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, KRS 427.010(2) did not protect her post-petition federal tax refund from the trustee’s reach. Thus, debtor could not claim an exemption for her 2003 tax refund under the statute. 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 1350.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 427.010(2)(a) was virtually identical to the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA), 15 USCS §§ 1671-77, which was meant to prevent bankruptcies, not to function within the bankruptcy process, and there was no reason to believe that the General Assembly intended KRS 427.010(2) to be read differently than the CCPA, upon which it was clearly modeled. Absent a showing of the General Assembly’s intent to allow KRS 427.010(2) to continue in the bankruptcy process, debtor could not utilize the garnishment statute to protect her post-petition federal income tax refund from the trustee’s reach. 2004 Bankr.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The exemption under KRS 427.010 did not apply to the recovery of an insurance fraud claim worth approximately $5,000 which was not reported during the course of the bankruptcy case, but was only raised after the case was reopened by the trustee. The court found this exemption was claimed in bad faith considering debtor failed to disclose the asset at a time when she knew it existed. In re Keith, 336 B.R. 746, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 79 (Bankr.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature in enacting this section did not intend to restrict exempt status to only those arrangements expressly set forth therein, since it recognized the existence of other sophisticated benefit systems regardless of their generic term under the all-encompassing phrase “similar plan or contract” in subdivision (1)(b). To be thus included the similar plan or contract must possess the characteristics of those programs expressly stated or be so parallel in nature as to serve the same goals or purposes.

It is well recognized that Individual Retirement Account (IRA) accounts do possess these traits in that benefits through contributions of a tax-deferred nature do flow to the debtor and his dependents under a formalized plan conditioned upon certain prospective elections or future events, and mandating that such accounts to be deemed a qualified plan must adhere to rigid requirements monitored by the Internal Revenue Service.

<p class="p6">A claimant’s production to a bankruptcy court of a grain storage receipt or scale ticket as evidence of ownership of a quantity of grain held by the trustee shall be sufficient to establish a prima facie claim of right to possession in such claimant of the quantity, quality, and type of grain specified in such document. In any case where a claimant has placed the original of such document on deposit with any party as collateral for a loan, an affidavit from such party verifying ownership of such receipt or scale ticket by the claimant shall be sufficient to establish a prima facie claim of right to possession in such claimant.</p>
