<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since under §§ 109 and 116 of the Constitution the Supreme Court only has the power to prescribe rules governing appellate procedure and jurisdiction and since the only restriction on appeal by the Commonwealth set forth by the Constitution of Kentucky, as stated in § 115, is that the Commonwealth may not appeal from a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case for any purpose other than securing a certification of the law; therefore, when the legislature, by enactment of subsection (4) of this section, attempted to establish rules of appellate procedure, it acted contrary to the dictates of the Constitution. Commonwealth v. Schumacher, 566 S.W.2d 762, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 524 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978), disapproved, Commonwealth v. Littrell, 677 S.W.2d 881, 1984 Ky. LEXIS 285 (Ky. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a trial court’s decision was not a final order, KRS 22A.020(4) allowed the Commonwealth to take an interlocutory appeal.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and 178.115, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a Circuit Court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal can be taken from a fiscal court order to the District Court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature did not intend anything significant by the word “Action” instead of “judgment” or its equivalent.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to take an interlocutory appeal from the District Court, and the Commonwealth would suffer irreparable harm if the District Court’s order suppressing the results of a breathalyzer test was enforced, the mandamus was the proper means for the Circuit Court to redress the District Court judge’s error. Billingsley v. Commonwealth, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 162 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2004 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 929 (Ky. Ct. App. June 4, 2004).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In habeas corpus proceeding for release from county jail on ground that judgment was void because trial commissioner had no legal authority or power and defendant was convicted of five charges but tried on only one, defendant instead of appealing denial of writ of habeas corpus to Court of Appeals should have exhausted his remedy of appeal to the Circuit Court where the case would have been tried de novo and question of lack of judicial authority in presiding judge and trial on multiple charges would have been eliminated.

Tipton v. Commonwealth, 770 S.W.2d 239, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 38 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989), overruled in part, Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 2004 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court had authority to issue a writ of prohibition to a district court judge who had issued an order precluding all county attorneys from objecting to questions made to defense witnesses during a preliminary hearing because the Kentucky Supreme Court was not the proper forum and access of such matters to the circuit court provided the parties with rapid and easy access to address claims of immediate and irreparable harm. Delahanty v. Commonwealth ex rel. Maze, 295 S.W.3d 136, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 124 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal because the order did not dispose of the ultimate issue, i.e., whether defendant was guilty of DUI, nor did it include finality language. Peters v. Commonwealth, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 2 (Ky. Ct. App. Jan. 8, 2010), rev'd, 353 S.W.3d 592, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 140 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the Commonwealth showed that there was an inadequate remedy by appeal and that it would have suffered great and irreparable injury if a trial court erred by suppressing a juvenile’s statement, a writ of prohibition was not appropriate for the State in a sodomy case because the 13-year-old juvenile’s statement given to police at a school was properly suppressed as involuntary in nature; although a 32-minute interrogation did not seem excessive, the repetitive questioning amounted to coercion by importunity. Even though Miranda rights were read, the juvenile was ordered by school officials into a room, he faced authority figures with considerable power who feigned superior knowledge, and they repeatedly demanded answers.

The circuit court did not err by granting a petition for writ of mandamus under KRS 23A.080(2) directing the district court to transfer appellant’s robbery case to the circuit court, because the conditions of KRS 635.020(4) were satisfied; appellant was older than 14 years of age and a participant in a crime in which a gun was used.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former husband’s breach of oral contract complaint was properly dismissed by Circuit Court; the complaint was an attempt to collaterally attack a property settlement from a dissolution action over which the family division had exclusive jurisdiction under KRS 23A.100. Bush v. Combest, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 293 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in treating a father’s exceptions to a commissioner’s child custody recommendations as a CR 59.05 motion and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by transferring the case to a Family Court because the recommendation was not a final judgment; rather, the trial court should have simply reviewed the exceptions, conducted a hearing, and entered a final judgment adjudicating the custody issue. The Family Court’s jurisdiction over domestic issues was not intended to be exclusive. Pursley v. Pursley, 242 S.W.3d 346, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 457 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 23A.100(2)(b) conferred general jurisdiction of the trial on a Family Court division for paternity proceedings, the Kentucky paternity statutes did not apply to grant subject matter jurisdiction to Kentucky courts to determine a paternity claim where there was no evidence or allegation that the marital relationship ceased 10 months before the child’s birth. Pursuant to KRS 406.011 a child born during lawful wedlock, or within 10 months thereafter, was presumed to be the husband and wife’s child. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred in declining to make findings that a child satisfied the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act that could enable her to acquire special immigrant status because the fact-finding process fell squarely within its jurisdiction to provide an adequate remedy for the child, who had been adjudged to be dependent and whose substantial rights were affected by such findings or lack thereof.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In keeping with its independence from the federal immigration process, the family court is fully authorized as the finder of fact to conclude under Kentucky law that a petitioner has failed to present evidence to support the special immigrant factors or that the evidence presented was not credible.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in reversing a family court decision declining to conduct a Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) hearing at the disposition phase of a dependency, neglect, and abuse case regarding an unaccompanied Guatemalan minor because, while the minor was a dependent child and entitled to the protection and care of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the courts of Kentucky were not required to make additional findings related to SIJ classification unless they first determine that the evidence to be gleaned from such a supplemental hearing was relevant to the child’s best interests, and there were also grave concerns about the use of the juvenile process in the case to circumvent federal immigration law.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contrary to a husband’s arguments, the fact that a District Court declined to issue an emergency protective order did not leave a Family Court without jurisdiction to issue a domestic violence order subsequent to a hearing on a wife’s petition; under KRS 23A.100(3), the Family Court was the primary forum for cases involving domestic violence and abuse although the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction to enter protective orders under KRS 403.725.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of appeals erred in holding that a family court lost jurisdiction to issue a domestic violence order on the ground that it failed to conduct a hearing within 14 days after the issuance of an emergency protective order because the family court’s failure was, at most, the erroneous exercise of subject matter jurisdiction; it was not a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under KRS 23A.100(2). Daugherty v. Telek, 366 S.W.3d 463, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a family court judge recused in a divorce action, she simultaneously and automatically disqualified herself from a domestic violence order proceeding as the very purpose for the creation of the family courts was to consolidate litigation and controversies related to a family into one court.

The family court had jurisdiction to make the proper balancing of the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rights and determine the best interests of the child. Smith v.

<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">This section was amended in 1982 Acts Chapter 445, which contains the following language in Section 45 of that Act: “This Act shall become effective on July 1, 1982.” The Ky. Constitution, in Section 55, requires that a reason be set forth for the emergency. However, no reason is set forth in this Act.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the fact that under KRS 453.010 the Circuit Court is not required to mandate the paying of costs by the Commonwealth, the Department of Labor should not pay the advance filing fee when appealing Workmen’s (now Workers’) Compensation Board opinions. OAG 77-775.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A filing fee of $70.00 in civil cases is payable in advance, but the $10.00 fee for issuing orders of attachment is not payable until termination of the suit. OAG 78-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clerk’s fee for issuance of a garnishment need not be paid in advance. OAG 78-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Commonwealth, except for the provisions of KRS 416.620, pertaining to proceedings for eminent domain, is exempt from paying costs, although it may, pursuant to KRS 453.010, pay costs when such costs are approved and allowed by the judge of the court in which the case was filed. OAG 78-343.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To apply the provisions of this section to suits filed prior to January 2, 1978, would make the statute retroactive in its application; since there is no provision or indication in the statute or in the bill enacting the statute that such an objective was intended and since KRS 446.080(3) states that no statute shall be construed to be retroactive, unless expressly so declared the filing fee requirement is applicable only to suits filed on and after January 2, 1978. OAG 78-517.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the sheriff must make a return on the item or document, he is entitled to a $3.00 fee for service, regardless of whether the process is served alone or in a group with other process, but if no return is required on the document (i.e., a pleading) he may not charge the $3.00 fee. OAG 79-510.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sheriff must compute his mileage per service of process and charge the responsible party at the applicable rate per mile traveled. OAG 79-510.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “process” as used in this section and KRS 24A.170 does not refer to every legal document, but is a technical term which refers to documents, such as summonses, by which the court may command a person to appear in an action or before the court, or the means, such as a temporary restraining order, whereby the court compels compliance with its demands. OAG 79-510.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The advance fees required by this section and KRS 24A.170 would have to be paid by an urban county government in civil actions to which it was a party. OAG 83-186.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and KRS 31.110 are not inconsistent. Edmonson v. Commonwealth, 725 S.W.2d 595, 1987 Ky. LEXIS 194 (Ky. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute allowing for costs to be assessed after sentencing, KRS 23A.205, allowed for court costs to be waived for “poor persons,” as defined in KRS 453.190(2), but did not give defendant the blanket immunity from costs that defendant suggested was required by KRS 31.110. Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant. Maynes v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 922, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 20 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Court Costs Properly Assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court's imposition of court costs and the arrest fee was affirmed where the record did not reflect an assessment of appellant's financial status, other than that he was appointed a public defender and permitted to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, and simply because appellant was represented by a public defender did not mean he was necessarily exempt from court costs. Spicer v. Commonwealth, 442 S.W.3d 26, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 435 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assessment of court costs was facially valid and did not constitute error, as the court expressly imposed court costs and made provisions for deferred payment, without finding that defendant was a “poor person.” Nunn v. Commonwealth, 461 S.W.3d 741, 2015 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a drug case, there was no error in requiring defendant to pay court costs because, even though defendant stated he did not believe he had money in a commissary account, the trial court did not find him to be a poor person. The trial court found that defendant would have been able to earn money to pay the nominal court costs after his release from prison. Hunt v. Commonwealth, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 65 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in imposing court costs where it made no factual determination that defendant was a poor person under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23A.205. Howard v. Commonwealth, 496 S.W.3d 471, 2016 Ky. LEXIS 333 (Ky. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in imposing court costs on appellant as the assessment of court costs was mandatory absent a specific finding that he was a poor person under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23A.205, and there had been no adjudication of his poverty status. Constant v. Commonwealth, 603 S.W.3d 654, 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 47 (Ky. Ct. App. 2020).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Costs Improperly Assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no method by which a trial court could indirectly impose fines under KRS 534.040(4) and court costs under KRS 23A.205(2) against a defendant by reducing his pretrial jail time credit; therefore, language in the judgment that could be taken to indicate that such credit would be reduced was ordered stricken. Smith v. Commonwealth, 366 S.W.3d 399, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 27 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court reversed the imposition of court costs and remanded for a finding whether defendant was a poor person, as defined in KRS 453.190(2), was unable to pay court costs, and would be unable to pay the court costs in the foreseeable future. Smith v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 908, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although appellant’s argument concerning costs and a fine was not preserved, costs and fines were imposed as part of a sentence, and thus could not be waived by failure to object. Butler v. Commonwealth, 367 S.W.3d 609, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant was found to be a “poor person” under KRS 453.190(2), a trial court erred in imposing costs under KRS 23A.205 and assessing a partial public defender fee under KRS 31.211(1). Miller v. Commonwealth, 391 S.W.3d 857, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 10 (Ky. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order requiring defendant to pay court costs despite defendant's indigency was not disturbed on appeal because defendant did not inform the trial court of defendant's indigency.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Court Costs Improperly Assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decision to impose or waive court costs was to be made by the trial court by or at the time of sentencing; there was no statutory basis for a court to exercise jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of court costs beyond the end of the proceedings, much less once the sentence has been imposed and served and the defendant has been released from prison. Buster v. Commonwealth, 381 S.W.3d 294, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 162 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellant was ordered to pay costs and fees immediately upon release from custody, and he was facing an over seven-year sentence during which he could not work; thus, there was not a reasonable basis to find that appellant would soon be able to pay costs, and that part of the order imposing costs and fees was vacated. Butler v. Commonwealth, 367 S.W.3d 609, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 73 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the trial court provided defendant with a six-month period of time to pay the court costs once he was released from incarceration, there was no indication in the record that the court made any findings regarding whether defendant was “poor” and whether he could presently or in the foreseeable future pay the court costs as required by KRS 23A.205. McElroy v. Commonwealth, 389 S.W.3d 130, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 292 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court's imposition of court costs under this section was unreasonable and constituted palpable error, as defendant had no job, asserts, or income, was facing a three and one-half year prison sentence, had nothing but a phone card while in jail, and was specifically found to be indigent under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 453.190 shortly after sentencing. Jones v. Commonwealth, 527 S.W.3d 820, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 442 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in ordering defendant to pay court costs in installments beginning sixty days after his release, as those necessarily could not be paid within one year of the date of sentencing.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the fact that the District Judge must be available at all times to issue civil or criminal process and the fact that his is a court of continuous session, a person could not carry on the work of a District Judge and be a master commissioner at the same time. OAG 77-186.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While prosecution as an habitual violator of the motor vehicle laws is not a criminal prosecution, it clearly comes under the jurisdiction of the District Court. OAG 78-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the broad legislative policy expressed in KRS 178.080 and 178.115, the acceptance of a road as a part of the county road system is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court under the specific guidelines set out in those sections. The action of a fiscal court in exercising such discretion could be reviewed, by direct action, in a Circuit Court as an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion; no appeal can be taken from a fiscal court order to the District Court, however, since that court has no appellate jurisdiction. OAG 82-445.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The enacting of an ordinance which contains provisions regarding the jurisdiction of the District Court which are identical to the provisions found in the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, KRS 383.505 to 383.715, would not be an enlargement of the court’s jurisdiction and would not, therefore, invalidate such an ordinance. OAG 83-251.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a District Court has found, as a result of a preliminary hearing proceeding, that probable cause exists to believe that a felony has been committed, but a grand jury has not yet returned an indictment, the District Court does not have the authority to order that personal property seized incident to the arrest or by execution of a search warrant be returned to the defendant. OAG 91-67.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless a District Court, upon a showing of good cause, amends a felony charge to a misdemeanor or finds a lack of probable cause and releases the defendant from custody, its sole authority with respect to a felony charge is the authority to examine the charge and determine whether to commit the defendant to jail or hold him to bail or other form of pre-trial release. OAG 91-67.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. This section, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence. OAG 91-67.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no authority under this section for the appointment of a judge pro tem of the District Court or the appointment of a pro tem trial commissioner. OAG 77-661.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the position of trial commissioner is a state office and membership on the county election board is a county office, an individual would be prohibited from holding both positions at the same time by Const., § 165 and KRS 61.080.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county sheriff must execute and make due return on all criminal process lawfully issued by a county trial commissioner (process as authorized by SCR 5.030) and placed in the sheriff’s hands or with his lawful deputies. OAG 80-332.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The positions of deputy circuit clerk, a state officer under KRS 30A.010, and trial commissioner of the county District Court, a state officer under this section are compatible with one another, since neither Const., § 165, nor KRS 61.080 prohibits a person from holding two state offices at the same time; however, they may be incompatible under the doctrine of practical or common law. OAG 81-124.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lawyer who represents defendants in criminal cases cannot also be appointed to the position of trial commissioner pursuant to this section and Const., § 113, since the judicial functions of the trial commissioner are inherently inconsistent and repugnant to the role of a defense attorney in criminal cases, and, in addition, the trial commissioner of one district court cannot personally appear in criminal matters before another District Court within the same judicial district.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a city has either established a position of legal advisor as a form of city employment or created the office of city attorney, no one could hold at the same time the state office of trial commissioner and the office of city attorney or city employment without violating Const., § 165 and KRS 61.080. However, if an attorney is employed on a personal service contract basis, he would be considered an independent contractor and there would be no constitutional or statutory objection to his serving as trial commissioner of the District Court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where jurisdiction initially attached in the Circuit Court, it was not lost when that court, during the course of the trial, dismissed one felony count of a three-count indictment; jurisdiction having attached by reason of the felony charge was not divested by its final determination. Broughton v. Commonwealth, 596 S.W.2d 22, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 520 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court ruling that there was no probable cause for search of defendant charged with drug possession and that evidence seized in the search should be suppressed was not binding on Circuit Court in subsequent trial since District Courts have no jurisdiction for final disposition of felony cases under this section. Waugh v. Commonwealth, 605 S.W.2d 43, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 366 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with burglary in the first degree and persistent felony offender in the first degree, the issuance of the indictment on the felony charge terminated the jurisdiction in the District Court and placed the sole jurisdiction in the Circuit Court; therefore, the District Court had no jurisdiction to accept the defendant’s plea to a reduced charge and there was no double jeopardy when the defendant was subsequently arraigned in the Circuit Court. Commonwealth v. Hamblem, 628 S.W.2d 345, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 315 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section unequivocally places jurisdiction in the Circuit Court when an indictment charges both a felony and a misdemeanor. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court has no power to dispose of any charges which constitute lesser included offenses of the felony charged in the indictment. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action of the District Court in accepting a plea of guilty to a possession charge after the return of the grand jury’s indictment for trafficking did not preclude a Circuit Court conviction on the same possession charge, as once the indictment was returned charging the offense of trafficking, the District Court no longer had jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the offense of possession, a lesser included offense. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 633 S.W.2d 61, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 246 (Ky. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Until such time as an indictment is reported to the Circuit Judge in a felony case, the District Court may exercise its jurisdiction and enter any order or judgment it deems appropriate; the reporting of an indictment to the Circuit Judge is essential to the validity of that action. Commonwealth v. Karnes, 657 S.W.2d 583, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 263 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a District Court lacked jurisdiction to make a final adjudication as to defendant’s felony charges, its dismissal of those charges did not preclude the Commonwealth, on double jeopardy grounds, from proceeding against defendant in Circuit Court on the same charges. Commonwealth v. Stephenson, 82 S.W.3d 876, 2002 Ky. LEXIS 165 (Ky. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>County attorney and the district court did not have the authority to approve a deferred prosecution on a charge of first-degree possession of a controlled substance under KRS 218A.14151 because only the Commonwealth’s attorney and the circuit court had jurisdiction over a felony offense. Commonwealth v. Vibbert, 397 S.W.3d 910, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 60 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After an indictment has been returned incorporating misdemeanor offenses with related felony offenses, the misdemeanor offenses may be tried in the Circuit Court along with the felony offenses. Keller v. Commonwealth, 594 S.W.2d 589, 1980 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A District Court has jurisdiction to hold a preliminary hearing on a misdemeanor charge and to refer that misdemeanor to the grand jury if it is joined with a felony. When the District Court conducts such a preliminary hearing, jeopardy will not attach on the misdemeanor to the extent that it has been joined with a felony. Commonwealth v. Arnette, 701 S.W.2d 407, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 296 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Special Circuit Judge could not enforce his judgment accepting defendant’s plea of guilty of charge of driving under the influence (DUI) since such charge had not been consolidated with felony charge of possession of cocaine and, since District Court and not Circuit Court had jurisdiction. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 806 S.W.2d 643, 1991 Ky. LEXIS 34 (Ky. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A Circuit Court, vested with jurisdiction by a grand jury indictment, does not lose jurisdiction when a felony indictment is amended to a misdemeanor. Commonwealth v. Adkins, 29 S.W.3d 793, 2000 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a Governor’s blanket pardon for individuals involved in a merit system investigation was valid under Ky. Const. § 77 and there was no evidence that defendant rejected the pardon, the order dismissing the indictment was vacated because the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction and the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the misdemeanor charges under KRS 24A.110. Commonwealth v. Groves, 209 S.W.3d 492, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 345 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court properly granted summary judgment to the police officer on the arrestee’s claim for false arrest because officer acted pursuant to legal process, and although it was later determined that arrest warrant lacked probable cause, district court had authority to issue the warrant based on a charge of terroristic threatening. Juillerat v. Mudd, 735 Fed. Appx. 887, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 14238 (6th Cir. Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Remand of Misdemeanor Charge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a felony and misdemeanor are originally joined but later separated, the Circuit Court may remand the misdemeanor to the District Court for disposition. Kimbro v. Lassiter, 648 S.W.2d 860, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Circuit Court judge did not commit reversible error in remanding a misdemeanor charge to the District Court after a felony count that was coupled with the misdemeanor was dismissed by the Circuit Court. Kimbro v. Lassiter, 648 S.W.2d 860, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a misdemeanor offense and a felony offense are joined in a single indictment, after the Commonwealth dismisses the felony charge then the trial court should immediately remand the misdemeanor to the District Court. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 806 S.W.2d 643, 1991 Ky. LEXIS 34 (Ky. 1991).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Unpublished decision: </i>Pursuant to KRS 24A.110(2), the district court, rather than the circuit court, enjoyed exclusive jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the defendant’s charge of failing to register a change of address as a sex offender, because the charge against the defendant could only be brought under the 1998 version of 17.510, for which the offense was a Class A Misdemeanor, rather than the 2000 version of the statute, for which the offense was a Class D Felony.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A grand jury may return a misdemeanor indictment, however it would be impractical to affirmatively seek a misdemeanor indictment, where it is not required, and is not a usual method of procedure. OAG 78-168.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Court has jurisdiction to dispose of any nonfelony criminal offense and the charge may be brought by information or complaint. OAG 78-168.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The enforcement of city ordinances is generally within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court and all fees, fines, forfeitures and costs in any District Court case shall be collected and accounted for by the circuit court clerk and paid into the state treasury; however, the city does not receive fines imposed by the District Court and collected by the Circuit Court Clerk although the city, pursuant to former KRS 24A.190 through 24A.192, may have funds returned to it if it qualifies under those statutes. OAG 78-682.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The only reading of KRS 318.190, 23A.010 and this section which gives effect to all three statutes is that the misdemeanor penalty established by KRS 318.990 must be prosecuted in District Court. OAG 78-742.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant, who is charged with a felony, is placed on trial before a Circuit Judge and jury, and the felony charge is amended to a lesser included misdemeanor charge by the Circuit Judge, the Circuit Court must proceed with trial of the misdemeanor to judgment. OAG 79-570.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The authority for a District Court to order transfer of District Court prisoners to an out-of-the-county jail is an inherent power under its general criminal jurisdiction. OAG 79-588.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney is required to prosecute violations of municipal ordinances in the District Court. OAG 80-34.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Court’s criminal jurisdiction under this section inherently gives him the authority to see to it that prisoners under his jurisdiction and requiring incarceration are placed in a suitable county jail. OAG 80-129.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 61.170 requires an indictment by a Circuit Court grand jury in order to charge the offense of malfeasance or neglect of county officers; but since this section vests exclusive jurisdiction of misdemeanor cases, generally, in the District Court, the Circuit Court in which such an indictment is returned has necessarily, because of the jurisdictional statute, the authority and duty to refer the indictment for trial or other appropriate disposition to the District Court of that county. OAG 80-152.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if subsection (4) of this section is interpreted literally, it is impossible for a District Court to amend a third or subsequent offense under KRS Chapter 242 and treat it as a first or second offense, since the convictions of the first and second offense are already of record and nothing can change that fact. OAG 80-335.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the record of two or more prior convictions under KRS Chapter 242 indicates that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to try the defendant a third time, the defendant could, under RCr 10.22 (abolished), file a motion in arrest of judgment on the ground of no jurisdiction, provided that the motion is filed within five days after determination of guilt; in view of RCr 13.04, a defendant in such case could file a motion to set aside the judgment under the terms outlined in CR 60.02. OAG 80-335.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where court records show two convictions under KRS Chapter 242, the third offense under that chapter would be a felony, and the District Court would not have jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea or try the case since this section expressly provides that the District Court has no jurisdiction of felony cases. OAG 80-335.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The judge has the primary duty to determine where the defendant is to be committed and to enter an order directing such commitment; however, the court may order the sheriff to keep it informed of what facilities are available for housing the prisoners, and where the judges have ordered the sheriff to keep them informed of what facilities are available to house prisoners, he must do so. OAG 80-482.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a peace officer issues a citation pursuant to KRS 431.015 charging a person with the violation of a city ordinance, and the person fails to appear in response to the citation, the District Court cannot acquire jurisdiction under subsection (2) of this section and cannot impose a fine against the person until the person is properly before the court, either by way of a voluntary personal appearance or pursuant to a warrant or summons. OAG 81-252.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Felony cases do not have to go through District Court before they are presented to the grand jury and once a person is indicted on a felony charge by a grand jury, the case cannot be sent back to the District Court since the District Court no longer has jurisdiction in the case. OAG 83-31.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court to examine a charge of first-degree wanton endangerment, a felony. OAG 83-31.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. This section, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence. OAG 91-67.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless a District Court, upon a showing of good cause, amends a felony charge to a misdemeanor or finds a lack of probable cause and releases the defendant from custody, its sole authority with respect to a felony charge is the authority to examine the charge and determine whether to commit the defendant to jail or hold him to bail or other form of pre-trial release. OAG 91-67.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a District Court has found, as a result of a preliminary hearing proceeding, that probable cause exists to believe that a felony has been committed, but a grand jury has not yet returned an indictment, the District Court does not have the authority to order that personal property seized incident to the arrest or by execution of a search warrant be returned to the defendant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Landlord was entitled to a writ of prohibition as to a forcible detainer action because the action was brought before a district court whose jurisdiction did not exceed $5,000, and the amount in controversy was $8,100, so the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and the court’s orders were void, although the landlord was not entitled to a writ on the grounds Ky.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters, any papers relative to an uncontested estate in which no final settlement was filed prior to January 2, 1978, should be transferred to the clerk of the District Court of that county and duplicates should be filed with the county clerk. OAG 78-68.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Judge has the authority to take the executor’s bond book or administrator’s bond book from the county clerk’s office and surrender it to the circuit clerk since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters (wills and settlement of estates). OAG 78-118.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section vests the exclusive jurisdiction over uncontested probate or estate matters in the District Court, it repeals KRS 424.340 by implication. OAG 78-147.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The responsibility for advertising for creditors with respect to probate and estate matters rests with the personal representative, especially since the statutes place this task on no public official. OAG 78-147.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney would handle civil appeals to Circuit Court in which the county is a party. OAG 78-190.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of uncontested probate matters, and since a contest of probate matters can only be filed in the Circuit Court, if at the time a will and related papers are offered and tendered with the District Court no adversary proceeding in such estate has been instituted in the Circuit Court, the District Court may proceed to exercise its jurisdiction; thus a party cannot come into the District Court objecting to the probate of the will or threatening to file litigation in Circuit Court, since such adversary party will have to file a suit in Circuit Court contesting such proposed will. OAG 79-81.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A clerk is not responsible in any way to any person who may be misled if a certified copy of an order of appointment is given to an administrator named in the copy who uses it to show his appointment, when actually the estate has been settled: the clerk has no duty to inform the public of the active or inactive status of each estate. OAG 79-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clerk is not responsible for determining whether an estate has been settled before making certified copies of court orders showing appointment of administrators, executors, etc., in connection with the administration and settlement of estates. OAG 79-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The District Court has jurisdiction in actions under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act where there is an attempt to enforce support arrearage in excess of $1,500, notwithstanding the provisions of this section because, while this section generally governs the District Court’s jurisdiction, in the specific matter of uniform support actions, KRS 407.100(4) (repealed) and 407.170 (repealed) are controlling so that, regardless of the amount of support money sued for, the District and Circuit Courts have concurrent jurisdiction of such actions. OAG 80-159; OAG 80-615.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A District Court which has found probable cause to believe a felony has been committed lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion in that criminal proceeding for the release of personal property held as evidence by the Commonwealth. KRS 24A.110, which defines a District Court’s criminal jurisdiction, provides no such authority. Therefore, a District Court cannot entertain a motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to or in support of a felony charge on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained. However, there may be cases in which the District Court may be empowered, pursuant to its jurisdiction in civil matters, to entertain an independent civil proceeding for the return of property not subject to forfeiture which is held as evidence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As between legislation of a broad and general nature on one hand and legislation dealing minutely with a specific matter on the other hand, the specific will prevail over the general, and, accordingly, the specific prohibition of KRS 189.990 against imposing of costs in parking violations prevails over the generality of this section, which purports to require payment of costs in all criminal prosecutions upon conviction. OAG 78-328.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where two statutes enacted at the same session are destructively repugnant, the law last enacted must be regarded as the final expression of the legislative will and permitted to prevail; since amended KRS 189.990(1) and this section are destructively repugnant, KRS 189.990, as the last enacted, prevails. OAG 78-328.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reasonable construction of former subsection (5) of this section means that the jail money paid by the circuit clerk to the county treasurer should be considered for expenditure, during the fiscal year received, through the budget item or items established for county jail operations, since Const., § 157 and KRS Chapter 68 contemplate a pay-as-you-go budget and no fiscal court can deliberately budget surpluses. OAG 80-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the responsibility of the fiscal court to see that any county jail money, arising out of this section, which is actually surplus at the end of a particular fiscal year is either placed in a reserve fund for construction, or budgeted for expenditure for noncapital jail purposes for subsequent fiscal years, depending upon the necessary operational expenses of the county jail; in any event, this section requires that the so-called jail money be spent for the sole purpose of defraying the costs of operation of the county jail. OAG 80-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The money coming into the county treasury pursuant to former subsection (5) of this section may be budgeted or earmarked by way of a special reserve fund for construction purposes, which may be maintained and carried over for the number of fiscal years necessary, provided that the fiscal court has by order or resolution committed the county to a definite capital project, supported by a bond issue or holding corporation action on the part of fiscal court. OAG 80-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “costs of operation of the county jail” in former subsection (5) of this section is very broad; under ordinary usage of language the phrase is broad enough to embrace the use of the money for new construction of a jail or construction of a new addition. OAG 80-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former subsection (5) of this section was enacted to allay a shortage of funding for the operation of jails and housing of prisoners and the funds allotted hereunder were intended to be used to defray all costs associated with performing the duty of operating a jail. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The funds allotted pursuant to former subsection (5) of this section may be used for capital expenditures in connection with constructing a new jail or renovating an old one. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The money allotted under former subsection (5) of this section may be used for juvenile detention costs such as the payment of per diem fees to families who keep juveniles or to the county juvenile detention center for keeping out of county juveniles insofar as these juveniles could be housed and kept in the county jail if there was one. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The money allotted under former subsection (5) of this section may be used to pay the charges made to a county which had no jail by other counties that house and keep its prisoners in their jails. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where prisoners that would have been housed in a county jail, if it had one, were instead housed in a city jail, the city could charge the county on a cost-sharing percentage or per diem basis for housing the county prisoners, just as one county may charge another for performing like services and the county jail fund could be used to pay this charge. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is a jail, the funds collected under former subsection (5) of this section may be used to defray the costs of running the physical facility and of keeping and housing prisoners therein and, where the county does not have a jail, the funds may be used to cover the costs of providing alternative methods of housing and keeping prisoners. OAG 80-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payment of a salary to a jailer during the closing of the jail for capital improvements is legal where the jailer is putting in at least a normal five-day work week supervising the capital improvements on the jail and preparing himself to run the jail once it reopens. OAG 80-661.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a new jailer supervised capital improvements on jail and, while the jail was closed for such improvements, also took applications and interviewed prospective deputies and worked on a daily basis with state officials and prepared a procedures manual which the county judge/executive had requested that he prepare, such activities related exclusively to the county jail operation and the phrase “operation of the county jail” in former subsection (5) of this section is broad enough to cover the period during which the jail was being repaired and the new jailer was preparing himself to adequately perform as jailer once the jail reopened; moreover, the repair of the jail is vital to its effective use as a place of detention and thus the repair period must logically fall within the ambit of jail operations, therefore, the regular jailer’s salary may be paid to the new jailer during said period out of the cost money described in former subsection (5) of this section. OAG 80-661.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The money going to the counties from this section is for the sole purpose of defraying the costs of operation of the county jail. Such money may be spent to fund or partially fund the salary of a jail matron, which is properly a part of the costs of operating a county jail, subject to proper budgeting procedure under KRS Ch. 68. OAG 82-137.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the two 1982 amendments to this section are generally similar in that they involve court cost increases, there is no express nor implied basis for repeal of one by the other; thus effect must be given to both. OAG 82-208.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1982 amendment by ch. 235 provides for the $5.00 increase of costs listed under subdivisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section in order to help in the funding of county jails while Acts 1982, ch. 266, which increases the same fees by $7.00, is an “Act relating to fees and costs for utilizing state services” (performed by state employees or officers); the two amendments, in increasing such court costs, had two different purposes in mind and for that reason they cannot be considered in duplication of each other. OAG 82-208.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are no apparent conflicts between the two 1982 amendments to this section, and thus the $5.00 increase of ch. 235 and the $7.00 increase of ch. 266 must be added together for a total of $12.00 increase of the court costs dealt with in subdivisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section. OAG 82-208.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since former subsections (5) and (6) of this section had two different purposes in mind, one being jail operational costs, the other being construction costs, they are not in duplication of each other. OAG 82-314.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The principle that the specific shall prevail over the general means that former subsection (6) of this section must be recognized as being exclusive of former subsection (5) of this section, since it deals with the specific expense of construction costs. OAG 82-488.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mandate of former subsection (5) of this section was such that the fiscal court was restricted to using that money only for county jail operational costs. None of those funds can be reserved for some other purpose, such as jail construction costs. OAG 82-488.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former subsection (6) money was to be used only for jail construction, while former subsection (5) money was to be used by the fiscal court for jail operational costs that do not include construction costs. When those subsections are read in pari materia, the emerging intent is that operational costs may cover any jail expense except construction costs; in that manner, the two subsections are a part of a connected system. OAG 82-488.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p9">The purpose of KRS 24A.200 to 24A.360 is to improve the administration of justice in small noncriminal cases, and make the judicial system more available and comprehensible to the public; to simplify practice and procedure in the commencement, handling, and trial of such cases in order that plaintiffs may bring actions in their own behalf, and defendants may participate actively in the proceedings rather than default; to provide an efficient and inexpensive forum with the objective of dispensing justice in a speedy manner; and generally to promote the confidence of the public in the overall judicial system by providing a forum for small claims.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a court can only facially invalidate a statute for vagueness if the statute chills a substantial amount of protected speech, the court finds that the “reasonably be questioned” language of KRS 26A.015(2)(e) and SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) is not impermissibly vague. Family Trust Found., Inc. v. Wolnitzek, 345 F. Supp. 2d 672, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24458 (E.D. Ky. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs, who sought to have judicial candidates answer survey questions regarding their views on particular issues, were entitled to a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of SCR 4.300-5B(1)(c), which sought to regulate and prohibit statements of candidates for judicial office, because Canon 5B(1)(c) was overbroad in that it prohibited certain types of protected speech and plaintiffs were likely to prevail with respect to this claim. However, plaintiffs were not likely to prevail with respect to their challenge to the recusal statute, KRS 26A.015(2)(e), or SCR 4.300-3E(1) because they had not shown that they would suffer irreparable injury if the court denied the relief requested. Family Trust Found., Inc. v. Wolnitzek, 345 F. Supp. 2d 672, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24458 (E.D. Ky. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) and KRS 26A.015(2)(e) may have the effect of chilling some speech, the court could not conclude that in light of the state’s compelling interest in maintaining the impartiality and appearance of impartiality of the courts that SCR 4.300-3(E)(1) and KRS 26A.015(2)(e) prohibits a “substantial” amount of protected speech in relation to its many legitimate applications.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no merit in the argument that a trial judge is not required to disqualify himself if his ruling involves a question of law rather than a matter of discretion, since this section does not condition a judge’s disqualification on the type of ruling involved. Carter v. Commonwealth, 641 S.W.2d 758, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 263 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 26A.020(1) provides a separate and distinct opportunity to a party who does not believe he or she will receive a fair and impartial trial. When a party or counsel seeks to disqualify or recuse a judge from proceeding further in any matter, a motion can be filed with the judge under this section or an affidavit pursuant to KRS 26A.020. It would also appear that an aggrieved party can do either or both. Nichols v. Commonwealth, 839 S.W.2d 263, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 143 (Ky. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant-petitioner, pursuant to CR 76.36, sought a writ of probation, seeking to disqualify the judge, under subsection (2)(d)2 of this section, since one of plaintiff’s cocounsel was the judge’s sister, it did not matter whether the degree of relationship was computed according to the common-law method, by which the degree is ascertained by counting down from common ancestor to the more remote party, or under the civil law method, which counts from one party to the common ancestor then down to the other, since in either event the sister was within the third degree of relationship, and accordingly the judge must disqualify himself. Middle States Coal Co. v. Cornett, 584 S.W.2d 593, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 681 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an attorney married to the sister of the trial judge in the proceeding was intended to be one of the co-counsels but did not actually participate in the trial, he nevertheless acted “as a lawyer in the proceeding” under subsection (2)(d) of this section since it is immaterial whether that relationship continued into the trial itself; therefore, the trial judge’s refusal to disqualify himself constituted reversible error. Middle States Coal Co. v. Hicks, 608 S.W.2d 56, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 380 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the spouse of the trial judge was an associate of the law firm that represented the patient in the medical malpractice action before the trial judge, the trial judge erroneously failed to recuse herself from the trial, as KRS 26A.015(2)(d)(2) and SCR 4.300, Canon 3E(1)(d)(ii) required the trial judge to recuse oneself if the judge’s spouse appeared before the trial judge, and SCR 1.10(a) imputed disqualification of one (1) associate of a law firm to all members of the firm.

Once brought to the attention of the judge or justice, compliance with this subdivision is mandatory. Commonwealth v. Carter, 701 S.W.2d 409, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 301 (Ky. 1985).</p>

Poorman v. Commonwealth, 782 S.W.2d 603, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1008, 110 S. Ct. 3249, 111 L. Ed. 2d 759, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3327 (U.S. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that appellate judge did not disqualify herself did not entitle appellant to reversal, where there was no issue on appeal directly or indirectly involving appellate judge’s rulings made at the District Court level, as the issues on appeal were confined to Circuit Court proceedings; the record did not suggest that the judge was aware before it was time for oral argument of her previous limited connection to this case; and where after it was brought to her attention during oral argument, there was no suggestion that appellant or his counsel preferred her recusal. Poorman v. Commonwealth, 782 S.W.2d 603, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1008, 110 S. Ct. 3249, 111 L. Ed. 2d 759, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3327 (U.S. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Some reasons for recusal are: (1) there is an issue on appeal that called for the trial judge to review a decision he had made at the District Court level; and (2) the trial judge was apprised of his connection with the matter sufficiently in advance of the time when the case is to be heard so that he could have been replaced without interrupting the procedure.

Also, the original motion to disqualify was not supported by an affidavit and finally, if defendant had filed a proper motion as required by this section, he could have required the matter to be transmitted to the Chief Justice for an immediate ruling, thereby avoiding what he later claimed was an unfair trial because of a presumptively biased judge.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not mandate the placing of the Circuit and District Courts on the same floor or placing them in the same courtroom. OAG 77-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended to weigh the sheer urgency of housing the new court system against the housing of necessary and vital county governmental operations in county courthouses and other county buildings and the housing of the new court system was to be given a high priority, subject to the principle that necessary county governmental operations would not be disrupted. OAG 78-116.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision that the county shall provide such “reasonably available space” to the court system indicates that the initial determination of whether reasonably available space exists in a particular county is addressed, not to the judicial courts, but to the fiscal courts, and the fiscal court’s decision in this matter is final, except where the courts determine in an appropriate suit that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in determining that the space was not reasonably available for the courts. OAG 78-116.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a county cannot provide satisfactory office space for the Circuit Judge, and no public facilities are available as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, then under subsection (5) of this section, private facilities may be leased for the judge by the Finance Department. OAG 82-14.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a fiscal court is leasing courthouse space to the Circuit Judge, the fiscal court could not terminate this lease and use this office space for other county offices. OAG 82-14.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a Circuit Court is being held in a county courthouse, the fiscal court is, as a practical matter, required by subsection (2) of this section to also provide a Circuit Judge’s chambers or office in the courthouse. OAG 82-14.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assuming that the Supreme Court of Kentucky has not ordered nor approved otherwise, the county government is mandated to furnish reasonably available space, as necessary, in the county courthouse, for the court system, as described in subsection (2) of this section, which would not disrupt the operation of county government. OAG 84-159.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is clear from reading subsection (1) of this section that the county courthouse is the prime sought location of the local courts and the adjunctive operations, and the county, through the fiscal court, must provide such location, where the needed space is reasonably available and would not disrupt the operation of county government. OAG 84-159.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision that the county shall provide such reasonably available space to the court system indicates that the initial determination of whether reasonably available space exists in a particular county is addressed to the fiscal court; its decision is final, except where the courts determine, in appropriate litigation, that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily. OAG 84-159.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering that the adequate housing of the court and the jail systems are to be given a high priority, under KRS 67.080, 67.083 and this section, the fiscal court of any county has the authority to allocate space in the county courthouse or its county buildings for the court and jail systems; its exercise of such authority can only be reversed by the courts, in a proper law suit, where the courts deem that the fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in its allocation decisions. OAG 84-263.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The first or immediate level of responsibility for furnishing space to the court system rests with the county government, and the initial determination of whether “reasonably available space” exists in a particular county facility is addressed to the appropriate fiscal court; therefore, unless the Kentucky Supreme Court has ordered otherwise, the county government is required to furnish reasonably available space in the county courthouse facilities.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The old police court records of Kentucky, like all court records, are subject to the control of the Supreme Court of Kentucky. OAG 80-181.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court records are given a special status and placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice pursuant to this section and KRS 26A.220; these statutes apply to all records of agencies of the court, and the Board of Bar Examiners is an agency of the court, as it is created and supervised by the Supreme Court. If a court or an agency of the court denies access to a record, the requesting party should take his appeal to the Chief Justice. Thus, denial of a request to inspect documents pertaining to the Kentucky bar examination under KRS 61.878 was proper. OAG 85-9.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Copies of the proceedings in certain indictments that have not been transcribed and made part of the official record on appeal, copies of all motions in certain cases that have not been transcribed and made part of the official record on appeal, copies of the “in chambers” proceedings in said cases that were recorded but not made part of the official record on appeal, and copies of any and all proceedings in said cases that were recorded but not transcribed and made part of the official record on appeal are court records and, therefore, are not subject to the terms and provisions of the Open Records Act. OAG 85-105.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The indictment, motions, arraignment, hearings, trial transcript, evidence presented in a proceeding, and presentence investigation were court records and, therefore, not subject to the terms and provisions of the Open Records Act. OAG 87-53.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court records are outside the purview of Open Records provisions. OAG 90-4.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Litigants frequently document in writing the terms of settlements, and they are seldom “generated for” or “received by” the trial court, and settlement records of this nature are not court records and are therefore within the scope of the Open Records Act. OAG 91-20.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The custody and control of records maintained by the Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission, including those containing the names of the members of the commission who heard requestor’s complaints, is vested in the Supreme Court. Accordingly, if a requestor is aggrieved by the denial of a record generated by the court, or an agency of the court, he must take his appeal to the Chief Justice. OAG 91-45.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Open Records Act does not apply generally to records generated by the Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission inasmuch as the commission is an agency of the Court of Justice, created under authority of the Kentucky Constitution and Supreme Court Rule; records of the court and agencies of the court enjoy a special status and are placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice pursuant to this section and KRS 26A.220.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The courts and judicial agencies are not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act except to the extent that those provisions are not in conflict with the court’s rules and regulations governing access to its own records, and are accepted as a matter of comity. All records which are made by or generated for or received by any other court, agency, or officer responsible to the Court, are the property of the Court and are subject to the control of the Supreme Court. Court records are therefore given a special status, and placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. OAG 98-ORD-6.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Administrative Office of the Courts is not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act. The AOC is part and parcel of the judicial department of the state and inseparable from the office of the Chief Justice itself; records generated by and for the AOC are indisputably records of the Court. It is for the Court to determine which policies evinced by the Open Records Law present interferences with the orderly conduct of its business, and which policies it will accept as a matter of comity.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) is not a “public agency” within the meaning of KRS 61.870(1), and is therefore not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the order of the Supreme Court of Kentucky of May 18, 1979, it is implicit that old police court records are considered available to the Circuit Court and Circuit Court clerk of the particular county; therefore, the Circuit Court clerk is considered the custodian of such records for the court and as such custodian, the circuit clerk, or lawful deputy, may authenticate a copy of the order found in the police court order book for introduction at a subsequent trial, as provided by RCr 9.44 and CR 44.01. OAG 80-181.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court records are given a special status and placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice pursuant to KRS 26A.220 and this section; these statutes apply to all records of agencies of the court, and the Board of Bar Examiners is an agency of the court, as it is created and supervised by the Supreme Court. If a court or an agency of the court denies access to a record, the requesting party should take his appeal to the Chief Justice. Thus, denial of a request to inspect documents pertaining to the Kentucky bar examination under KRS 61.878 was proper. OAG 85-9.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court records are outside the purview of Open Records provisions. OAG 90-4.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The custody and control of records maintained by the Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission, including those containing the names of the members of the commission who heard requestor’s complaints, is vested in the Supreme Court. Accordingly, if a requestor is aggrieved by the denial of a record generated by the court, or an agency of the court, he must take his appeal to the Chief Justice. OAG 91-45.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission, its members and employees are part and parcel of the court, and its records are inseparable from the judicial function. OAG 91-45.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Open Records Act does not apply generally to records generated by the Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission inasmuch as the commission is an agency of the Court of Justice, created under authority of the Kentucky Constitution and Supreme Court Rule; records of the court and agencies of the court enjoy a special status and are placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice pursuant to KRS 26A.200 and this section. OAG 91-45.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Bar Association is an agency of the court created and supervised by it and court records are given a special status under KRS 26A.200 and this section, and are exclusively governed by the Court of Justice. OAG 91-47.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The courts and judicial agencies are not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act except to the extent that those provisions are not in conflict with the court’s rules and regulations governing access to its own records, and are accepted as a matter of comity. All records which are made by or generated for or received by any other court, agency, or officer responsible to the Court, are the property of the Court and are subject to the control of the Supreme Court. Court records are therefore given a special status, and placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. OAG 98-ORD-6.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Administrative Office of the Courts is not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act. The AOC is part and parcel of the judicial department of the state and inseparable from the office of the Chief Justice itself; records generated by and for the AOC are indisputably records of the Court. It is for the Court to determine which policies evinced by the Open Records Law present interferences with the orderly conduct of its business, and which policies it will accept as a matter of comity. OAG 04-ORD-37.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) is not a “public agency” within the meaning of KRS 61.870(1), and is therefore not bound by the provisions of the Open Records Act. In addition, CASA officials and volunteers must keep confidential all information contained in records of the type requested except in conferring with or reports to the court pursuant to KRS 620.505(8), incorporated into the Open Records Act by virtue of KRS 61.878(1)(l).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 26A.300 violates equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. §§ 1, 2, 3 in that KRS 26A.300’s penalty is assessed when a motion for discretionary review is denied by this Court and, when applicable, the assessment of the penalty is automatic and mandatory and applies only to unsuccessful appellants in second appeals from superseded money judgments. A penalty is not assessed against other unsuccessful appellants in second appeals, e.g., unsuccessful plaintiff-appellants, unsuccessful defendant-appellants who do not supersede a money judgment awarded against them, and unsuccessful appellants from non-money judgments and, therefore, the statute treats unsuccessful appellants in second appeals differently; furthermore, KRS 26A.300 is not rationally related to its goal of deterring frivolous appeals, especially where alternate, non-discriminatory deterrents in the court’s rules are more effective. Elk Horn Coal Corp. v. Cheyenne Res., Inc., 163 S.W.3d 408, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 166 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 26A.300 violates the separation of powers provisions of Ky.

If the summons is served by mail, any prospective juror who does not return the juror qualification form within ten (10) days may be personally served by the sheriff at the discretion of the Chief Circuit Judge or Chief Circuit Judge’s designee.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> When there is an unanticipated shortage of available jurors obtained from a randomized jury list, the Chief Circuit Judge may cause to be summonsed a sufficient number of jurors selected sequentially from the randomized jury list beginning with the first name following the last name previously selected. The persons so chosen shall be summonsed as provided in this section, but need not be given the notice provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> Only persons duly qualified and summonsed under subsection (3) of this section and KRS 29A.070 shall serve as jurors.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> If, after making a fair effort in good faith, the judge is satisfied that it will be impracticable to obtain a jury free of bias in the county in which the prosecution is pending, the judge may obtain a sufficient number of jurors from some adjoining county in which the judge believes there is the greatest probability of obtaining impartial jurors. The judge shall request the Chief Circuit Judge for the adjoining county to draw and summon as many jurors as are needed. Jurors summonsed under this subsection need not be given the notice provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of former law providing for the selection of jury panels was to prevent the drum from being filled with names of friends and relatives of the jury commissioners. (Decided under prior law)Williams v. Commonwealth, 254 Ky. 277, 71 S.W.2d 626, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1934).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Scope of Rules of Procedure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The latest revision of the rules of procedure appears to have resulted in jury selection rules which differ from the statute; however, to the extent there is a conflict, it must be resolved by following the rules rather than the statute, since the power to fix the method of jury selection is inherently one for the courts and not the legislature. Trent v. Commonwealth, 606 S.W.2d 386, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 369 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Method of Summoning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One may not have complained of the method of summoning the jury when there was no issue to go to the jury. (Decided under prior law)Gahren, Dodge &amp; Maltby v. Parkersburg Nat'l Bank, 157 Ky. 266, 162 S.W. 1135, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 273 (Ky. 1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A juror whose name appeared in the sheriff’s return, but had not been drawn from the drum, should not have been allowed to serve. (Decided under prior law)Miller v. Commonwealth, 240 Ky. 346, 42 S.W.2d 518, 1931 Ky. LEXIS 411 (Ky. 1931).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that a deputy sheriff who assisted in summoning the jurors for a criminal case was prejudiced against and hostile to the defendant would not constitute grounds for discharging the jury at the conclusion of the commonwealth’s evidence, where the fact was known to the defendant before the jury was sworn and he could have made objection at that time. (Decided under prior law)Pennington v. Commonwealth, 294 Ky. 266, 171 S.W.2d 432, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 429 (Ky. 1943).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Obtaining Jury From Another County.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jurors may be obtained from another county in criminal cases, but the method of selecting such jurors was determined by the common law and not by statute providing for selection. The sheriff may secure previous jury lists from the circuit clerk of the other county. (Decided under prior law)Deaton v. Commonwealth, 157 Ky. 308, 163 S.W. 204, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 287 (Ky. 1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It did not constitute an honest, fair effort to obtain a jury locally merely to draw on the court’s personal knowledge of the situation and on evidence heard on a motion for a change of venue; there should have been at least some attempt or test by examination of prospective jurors. (Decided under prior law)Fannon v. Commonwealth, 295 Ky. 817, 175 S.W.2d 531, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 351 (Ky. 1943).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In prosecution for voluntary manslaughter it was an abuse of the court’s discretion to inquire into defendant’s allegation with respect to manner in which venire was summoned from adjoining county. (Decided under prior law)Vincent v. Commonwealth, 295 S.W.2d 555, 1956 Ky. LEXIS 164 (Ky. 1956).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where all of the prospective jurors in a prosecution for receiving stolen property received summonses by first-class mail notifying them of the need for their services as jurors, and all showed up at the proper place and at the proper time, the defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by the state’s failure to serve the summonses by certified or registered mail as required in former subsection (8) of this section. Reed v. Commonwealth, 641 S.W.2d 748, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 1982). (Decision prior to the 1982 amendment of this section).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a fair trial on the basis that the jury was not selected from a representative cross section of the community, where several prospective jurors were excused for medical, employment, or other hardship reasons, but the court did not excuse all those who expressed a desire to be excused. Stanford v. Commonwealth, 734 S.W.2d 781, 1987 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 1987), aff'd, 492 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 2969, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 3195 (U.S. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not violate the defendant’s right to a jury comprised of a fair cross section of the community by interviewing veniremen on the second day in alphabetical order, where the defendant did not identify any “distinctive” characteristic possessed by those whose surnames begin with the letters I-Z, and moreover, had the defendant proven or articulated such characteristics, there was no error as more than half of the jurors who actually heard the case had surnames beginning with these letters. Stanford v. Commonwealth, 734 S.W.2d 781, 1987 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 1987), aff'd, 492 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 2969, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 3195 (U.S. 1989).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The number of prospective jurors called by the court (38), and the decision made by the court to randomly select 28 out of that number for the jury selection process was proper, where all 38 potential jurors initially selected at random remained in the courtroom, available at all times during voir dire to randomly replace stricken jurors. Williams v. Commonwealth, 734 S.W.2d 810, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 513 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Randomness means that at no time in the jury selection process will anyone involved in the action be able to know in advance, or manipulate, the list of names who will eventually compose the empaneled jury. Williams v. Commonwealth, 734 S.W.2d 810, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 513 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Litigants had the right to demand that jurors be selected according to the statutes, and in passing on this right the qualifications of jurors or the fact that they may be acceptable to the parties was not to be considered. (Decided under prior law)Louisville, H. &amp; S. L. R. Co. v. Schwab, 127 Ky. 82, 105 S.W. 110, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 1313, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 119 (Ky. 1907); Kitchen v. Commonwealth, 275 Ky. 564, 122 S.W.2d 121, 1938 Ky. LEXIS 463 (Ky. 1938).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions and requirements of law providing for selection of jury panel were not merely directory but were of mandatory force in prescribing the one legal manner to be followed by the jury commission in its selection of grand and petit jurors, and must have been substantially complied with, even though noncompliance may have been waived by a party through failure to make proper objections at the proper time. (Decided under prior law)Williams v. Commonwealth, 254 Ky. 277, 71 S.W.2d 626, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1934). See May v. Commonwealth, 294 Ky. 308, 171 S.W.2d 465, 1943 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The judge had a duty to see to it that the commissioners followed the requirements of law providing for selection of jury panel. (Decided under prior law)Williams v. Commonwealth, 254 Ky. 277, 71 S.W.2d 626, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1934).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Substantial compliance with statutes respecting selection of names to be placed in jury wheel was imperative, although mere minor irregularities and informalities of procedure by jury commissioners should not have been ground for discharging panel.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the selection of a jury there must be substantial compliance with the procedural steps outlined in the statute, and the right and power to disregard any one of these statutory provisions does not lie within the privilege of the judge of the court. (Decided under prior law)Price v. Commonwealth, 366 S.W.2d 725, 1962 Ky. LEXIS 3 (Ky. 1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in drawing for additional possible jurors, only eight of the persons called appeared and nine names were put in the box but the absent person’s name was not drawn, there was no error in the selection of a jury. (Decided under prior law)Helton v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.2d 621, 1971 Ky. LEXIS 62 (Ky. 1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is in the interest of justice that the statutes and rules for jury selection be closely followed, and that no substantial deviation be allowed, regardless of prejudice; the matter of jury selection is too important a part of the judicial system to permit variations, from one court to another, in compliance with controlling statutes. Allen v. Commonwealth, 596 S.W.2d 21, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 519 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No substantial deviation from the method of jury selection provided by the rules and statutes is permitted, and where such a deviation has occurred, regardless of a showing of prejudice, if the error is properly preserved, a reversal is required. Bartley v. Loyall, 648 S.W.2d 873, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 289 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the procedure employed by the trial court in summoning prospective jurors complied with the relevant law, and the trial court’s failure to have those jurors who failed to respond to the summons personally served by the sheriff was not a substantial deviation from proper administrative procedure, no reversible error was found. Moreover, defendant failed to show that she was prejudiced by the procedure followed, a sufficient number of jurors existed, and the randomness of the jury pool was unaffected. Monroe v. Commonwealth, 244 S.W.3d 69, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 10 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit Court did not err in applying KRS 29A.060(4) when serving summons to jurors because under KRS 29A.060(4), the Circuit Court is left with the discretion to utilize the personal summons as it deems necessary; because the statute grants broader discretion to the Circuit Court than AP Part II, § 6, it does not hamper or unreasonably interfere with the administration of justice.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to a fair and impartial jury is fundamental and does not rest on the giving or not giving of the admonition to the jury not to form or express an opinion until the cause is finally submitted to them. (Decided under prior law)Butler v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Highways, 387 S.W.2d 867, 1965 Ky. LEXIS 490 (Ky. 1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where one of the jurors, after the evidence was finished but before the case was submitted to the jury, discussed the insurance aspects of the case with the secretary of one of the attorneys in the case, the admonition to the jury was violated, thus requiring a new trial. (Decided under prior law)Dalby v. Cook, 434 S.W.2d 35, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 221 (Ky. 1968).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reliance must be placed upon the integrity of the jurors and where the jury was near other people in a temporary courtroom while they assisted the deputy sheriff in obtaining chairs for the jury room a motion for new trial will not be granted on the ground that there was a separation of the jury while under special guard. (Decided under prior law)Roark v. Commonwealth, 321 S.W.2d 783, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 288 (Ky. 1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “separation” applies to the entire jury and where they are permitted to go about their business until told to reconvene, therefore, conveyance in more than one automobile to the scene of an accident is not “separation” requiring admonition under the statute since the jury is still functioning as an entity. (Decided under prior law)Davidson v. Moore, 340 S.W.2d 227, 1960 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under modern practice, jurors are no longer considered prisoners of court, and separation is permitted upon proper admonition by court. (Decided under prior law)Davidson v. Moore, 340 S.W.2d 227, 1960 Ky. LEXIS 23 (Ky. 1960).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where sheriff who participated in the investigation of case talked with a juror after the trial had commenced, but the conversation was “innocent,” trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial. Jones v. Commonwealth, 662 S.W.2d 483, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 400 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A new trial was necessary to obviate the error where a juror, despite the numerous and specific admonitions to the contrary, discussed the merits of the appellant’s case with a third party. Doyle v. Marymount Hospital, Inc., 762 S.W.2d 813, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 131 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that sheriff had engaged in conversation with three jurors constituted a harmless violation of this section, where the conversations were “innocent” and matters pertaining to the case at hand were not discussed. Talbott v. Commonwealth, 968 S.W.2d 76, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 41 (Ky. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juror’s brief conversation and contact with some of the prosecution’s witnesses during trial violated KRS 29A.310(2), but a mistrial was not warranted as there was no record of the brief conversation between the juror and the witnesses; thus, defendant could not meet his burden of showing that there was substantial injustice. Graham v. Commonwealth, 319 S.W.3d 331, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 183 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A conversation held by an officer with a juror after the jury had been sworn, and without the permission of the court, upon a subject not connected with the trial, was not such an irregularity as to require the verdict to be set aside, when it did not appear that the rights of accused were prejudiced. (Decided under prior law)Canter v. Commonwealth, 176 Ky. 360, 195 S.W. 825, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 69 (Ky. 1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Counsel for one of the litigants on trial was not an “officer” but if he did come within the purview of the statute there was no penalty attached for violation of the statute nor any punishment for violation by anyone and conversation of counsel with jurors on subject wholly unrelated to the case was not ground for a new trial. (Decided under prior law)C. V. Hill &amp; Co. v. Hadden's Grocery, 299 Ky. 419, 185 S.W.2d 681, 1945 Ky. LEXIS 438 (Ky. 1945).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to set aside deeds it was not reversible error because the clerk of the court talked to a couple of the jurors during the trial in contravention of statute prohibiting conversation with jury when the conversation was as to where in the community a corn shredder was located and as to where they would eat lunch since appellant’s rights were not prejudiced by innocent conversation with a juror on a matter foreign to the trial. (Decided under prior law)Owings v. Webb's Ex'r, 304 Ky. 748, 202 S.W.2d 410, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 718 (Ky. 1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was a temporary withdrawal of a juror from the immediate presence of his fellow jurors, or the guard, unless it was shown that something improper occurred the court would not grant a new trial upon that ground. (Decided under prior law)Horton v. Commonwealth, 240 S.W.2d 612, 1951 Ky. LEXIS 996 (Ky. 1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motion for a new trial was denied where after the case was submitted to the jury, a deputy sheriff entered the jury room with the jurors to open a window for ventilation and he swore he did not say anything to any one of the jurors about the case, nor did any of the jurors say anything to him relative to the case. (Decided under prior law)Roark v. Commonwealth, 321 S.W.2d 783, 1959 Ky. LEXIS 288 (Ky. 1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the jury foreman started to converse with a prosecution witness but was stopped by the jailer before she could do so, there was no violation of the statutes and no error. (Decided under prior law)Wright v. Commonwealth, 455 S.W.2d 561, 1970 Ky. LEXIS 261 (Ky. 1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied a mistrial after a juror had contact with one of the robbery victims during the penalty phase where the conversation was innocent, did not involve any improper exchange of information material to the case, and did not influence the jury’s verdict.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former section did not limit the right of the court to permit the jury to view objects other than real property or the place in which any material fact occurred, where such view is reasonably necessary for a proper understanding and appreciation of the facts in dispute, even though such objects are not located at the place of the accident. (Decided under prior law)Basham v. Owensboro C. R. Co., 169 Ky. 155, 183 S.W. 492, 1916 Ky. LEXIS 670 (Ky. 1916).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial judge did not abuse his discretion in overruling defendant’s request that jury view the crime scene, where defendant’s rationale for requesting the viewing was to show that lights at crime scene had been dimmer than eyewitnesses testified, a fact which could not be proven or disproven by a jury viewing. Sholler v. Commonwealth, 969 S.W.2d 706, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 98 (Ky. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for kidnapping and robbery, a jury view of the crime scenes had not been required under KRS 29A.310(3), as witnesses explained the events by use of photographs of the scenes and, by virtue of these visual aids, the jury was adequately apprised of the physical nature of the two (2) scenes.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action for damages by reason of an accident brought about by the unsafe and dangerous condition of a road, court properly exercised its discretion at the trial in refusing to order a view of the premises by the jury, where several months had elapsed since the accident, and the pile of gravel, alleged to have caused the injury, had been spread and condition of the road changed. (Decided under prior law)Henderson &amp; Corydon Gravel-Road Co. v. Cosby, 103 Ky. 182, 44 S.W. 639, 19 Ky. L. Rptr. 1851, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 47 (Ky. 1898).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In permitting jury to retire to the courthouse yard to see horse and phaeton in which injuries occurred, the court was not acting under terms of former section in that jury was not taken to see “real property” nor place where any “material fact occurred,” but court acted properly.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section might of itself prevent a person from serving as a public defender (now public advocate) and city attorney, especially if the public defender is employed to represent all indigents rather than where various attorneys are assigned on a case-by-case basis to represent indigents, there might also be an ethical problem involved which should be resolved by the Kentucky State Bar Association. OAG 73-851.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even after a fiscal court has established an office for public defender (now advocate), it may abolish that office and contract with a nonprofit organization to provide defender services. OAG 78-81.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By reasonable implication the fiscal court has the authority by ordinance to establish such positions, that is clerks, investigators, stenographers, as are necessary to carry out responsibilities of the office for public advocacy; once a particular position is authorized and created by the fiscal court, then under this section the district public advocate can fill the appointment, except that the fiscal court apoints the assistant district public advocates. OAG 78-700.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the fiscal court by ordinance has established the position of investigator for the staff of the district public advocate, then that position can be filled by the district public advocate without the consent of the fiscal court and the position cannot be filled by the nomination by a member of the fiscal court and the subsequent acceptance of the nomination by the fiscal court as a body. OAG 78-700.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The procedure envisioned in this section would govern over the general procedure established in KRS 67.710(7). OAG 78-700.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court assigning an attorney to represent a needy defendant will prescribe a reasonable fee under subsection (3) of this section, which shall be paid by the county; however, no county, under former KRS 31.240(3)(repealed, see now KRS 31.050(4)), shall be required to pay the maximum amounts provided in subsection (4) of this section, unless such amounts are approved by the Circuit Judge. Under this analysis, the mere agreement of the county to pay only just what the state contributes to the county, plus what the indigent pays, may not meet the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. OAG 84-280.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section was not intended to stake out the state contribution as the maximum to be paid by the committed county. In addition, where the court has set the fee under subsection (3) of this section, the fiscal court must, by the terms of former KRS 31.190 (repealed, see now KRS 31.050), pay that fee out of county appropriations, even if it equals the maximum provided in subsection (4) of this section; however, the court’s prescribed fee should not exceed the legislative maximum set out in subsection (4) of this section.

Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the trial court improperly denied appointment of counsel based upon the mere fact that a property bond had been posted to secure defendant’s release following his indictment, the court failed to apply the factors to determine defendant’s indigency as provided in KRS 31.120, and the court did not determine whether defendant was in fact indigent, defendant’s conviction for possession was reversed. Tinsley v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 668, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 61 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a defendant raises the issue of indigency, a hearing must be held thereon for a determination in accordance with the requirements set forth in KRS ch. 31, and the court must enter findings at the conclusion thereof. If the findings support indigency, counsel shall be appointed. If the findings do not support indigency, and the defendant persists in not employing counsel, he shall be deemed to have waived counsel, whereupon he is entitled to the protections of Faretta; should the trial court fail in the foregoing, the trial is defective. Tinsley v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 668, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 61 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the trial court did not hold a formal hearing, did not enter findings to support its decision to vacate defendant’s public defender appointment, and made no inquiries as to the amount of defendant’s income, nor did it consider any of the other factors listed in KRS 31.120(2), defendant was entitled to a new trial. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the issue was whether or not defendant was indigent, not the financial circumstances of his friends or family members, and the fact that defendant might have been able to retain private counsel for the civil action was not dispositive of whether he was entitled to a public defender at his criminal trial, defendant was entitled to a new trial where the trial court denied him a public defender. Baker v. Commonwealth, 228 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once the court determined that defendant was ineligible for public defender assistance as a result of his ownership of real property, pursuant to KRS 31.120(3)(a), the Department of Public Advocacy had no obligation to pay attorney’s fees.

Thus, the authority of the Public Defender to act in a case vests at the earliest point at which a person is entitled to counsel (i.e. custodial interrogation), but not until a claim, without further proof, is made of need for public assistance by the accused.

Rather, the trial court could consider under KRS 23A.205 both a defendant’s ability to pay at present and in the foreseeable future, whereas statutes such as KRS 31.100 regarding “needy persons” focused on a defendant’s inability to provide payment for representation by an attorney at all and KRS 31.211 provided solely for a “present tense” determination, which did not apply to defendant because defendant had been released from custody and could work to pay for the modest court costs assessed against defendant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The nature of the language of the compensation limitation in former subsection (4) of this section and the fact that master commissioners traditionally have performed judicial-type functions only in actions which involved execution of a judicial sale indicate that the $7,200 limitation applies only to compensation derived from fees arising from actions in which the master commissioner executes a judicial sale, and a master commissioner’s compensation for performing judicial-type functions in actions other than one in which he executes a judicial sale may exceed $7,200 annually. OAG 78-751.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person who is the master commissioner of the county Circuit Court can lawfully be appointed to serve as a member of the water commission, since the office of master commissioner is, under this section, merely a position filled by and under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, rather than a state, county or city office; thus, no incompatibility exists under KRS 61.080 and Ky. Const., § 165, between the two positions. OAG 81-313.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under CR 53.08 the maximum compensation payable to master commissioners is $24,000 per annum; the $7,200 annual limit imposed by former subsection (4) of this section applies only to compensation derived from fees arising from judicial sales executed by the commissioner. OAG 82-24.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After 90 days from the close of the 1982 session, the 1982 amendment to KRS 31A.010 will have the effect of providing that the master commission shall be compensated by fees as provided by rule of the Supreme Court; the rules referred to are CR 53.07 through CR 53.09 and, thus, at that point all of the master commissioners in Kentucky will be subject to a compensation derived from fees and not exceeding $24,000 per year. OAG 82-206.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting the 1982 amendment to this section, the legislature has eliminated the special restrictions on master commissioners’ compensation formerly found in subsection (4) of this section in favor of a general law applicable to all master commissioners within the Commonwealth of Kentucky. OAG 82-206.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The appointment of a receiver is in the nature of a provisional remedy, but is the last of that sort of remedies to be resorted to, and in the exercise of its legal discretion, in granting or denying a motion for a receiver, the court must be guided largely by the facts of the particular case, and keep in mind that the discretion must be exercised only as an auxiliary to attain the ends of justice more completely, when no other remedy will accomplish that end so satisfactorily.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The appointment of a receiver rests largely in the discretion of the chancellor, although it is not an unlimited discretion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where it was not claimed that the mortgage, by its terms, was such as to appropriate to the payment of appellant’s debt the rents, issues or profits of the mortgaged property, the appellant was without legal right to subject rents to the payment of its debts but only had an equitable claim to do so; hence, a receiver should not have been appointed for the assigned estate of an assignor for the benefit of creditors, where the assignee was in possession of the property, and there existed no valid reason why the assignee could not and would not faithfully preserve and administer the property, and perform the orders of the court with reference to the same.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A receiver will not be appointed where it appears that a greater injury will probably be caused by the appointment than by leaving the property undisturbed, for when a receiver is appointed for the property of a debtor upon the motion of a lienholder it is for the purpose of keeping and preserving the property so that the source of the security for the debt will not be destroyed, injured or removed and thus destroy or render less valuable the source of the security, and in such instances to sustain the motion, it must be shown that the receivership is necessary to prevent fraud, or to save the property from material injury or to rescue it from threatened destruction.
