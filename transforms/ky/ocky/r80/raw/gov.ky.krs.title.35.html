<p class="p7"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A name change by adoption is a special procedure in the Circuit Court and has no connection with name changing under this section. OAG 65-650.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not an exclusive method for use of persons desiring to change their names and the statute does not in any way militate against assertion of a married woman’s common-law right to change her first name without legal proceedings. OAG 72-27.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As this section is merely permissive, expanding the common law rather than providing an exclusive method for changing a name, it is not unconstitutionally discriminatory in its exclusion of married women from its provisions (opinion prior to 1974 amendment). OAG 72-432.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although her spouse objects, a married woman who is at least eighteen and a resident of the county can petition the county court for a first name and/or middle name change, including adding a given name never used before, where it appears to the court that the name change would not interfere with the rights of others and is not being done for a fraudulent purpose. OAG 74-349.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By the common-law method, a married woman can change her first and/or middle name without any statutory or court proceedings, including adding a given name never used before, and she can document her personal unilateral action by newspaper publication, business or personal letters, or a written statement placed in her lock box or private papers. OAG 74-349.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The action taken by the legislature in amending this section to delete “who is not a married woman” and in enacting KRS 116.085 clearly indicates that it intended that a married woman may use the permissive statute to change her surname from that of her husband to her maiden surname. OAG 74-902.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A convicted felon whose civil rights have not been restored may seek a change of name and need not place his felony conviction on his petition. OAG 76-126.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the Circuit Court is vested with continuing jurisdiction of custody matters attendant upon the dissolution of a marriage, and because KRS Chapter 403 mandates that the court safeguard family relationships and mitigate potential harm to parents and children, a Circuit Court has jurisdiction to enjoin a mother from changing a child’s name to his stepfather’s name, otherwise, an unsubstantial statutory right to apply for a name change would take precedence over an express statement of public policy favoring preservation of family relationships.

OAG 62-876.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where at the time a man married his second wife a suit for divorce from his first wife had been filed but the divorce was not yet granted, the second marriage was not valid even though the divorce was subsequently granted. OAG 62-904.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An application by underage persons to a Circuit Judge for permission to marry should properly be made by a motion filed in the Circuit Court in an ex parte proceeding. OAG 63-986.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Upon the basis of an affidavit from a doctor that the girl is pregnant, the Circuit Judge may in his discretion enter an order granting permission to marry and directing the county clerk to issue a marriage license to the parties. OAG 63-986.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The pregnant female applicant for a marriage license should be a resident of the county in which the application is made. OAG 66-475.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (5) (now (1)3.) of this section is not applicable where the child is born prior to making the application for a marriage license. OAG 68-203.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Except in a pregnancy situation involving imminent birth, the county judge (now county judge/executive) has no authority to waive the three-day waiting period. OAG 68-321.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county clerk should issue a license (provided other statutory requirements are met) to a male negro and a white female, since miscegenation statutes have been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States as being in violation of United States Const., Amend. 14. OAG 68-368.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the male applicant is under the age of 18, no license can be validly issued except in cases of pregnancy, and the 1968 amendment to KRS 402.210 did not authorize the marriage of persons under the age of 18 even with the consent of the parent. OAG 68-529.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section prohibits and renders void the marriage of a male under 18 years of age except when the female is pregnant and the 1968 amendment to KRS 402.210 which lowered the age at which the consent of the parent is no longer required from 21 to 18 did not, by implication, repeal this section. OAG 68-529.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a male under the age of 18 is married under a license issued with consent, as provided in KRS 402.210, but the female was not pregnant and the permission of the Circuit Judge was not obtained pursuant to the provisions of this section, the marriage is, pursuant to the provisions of this section, void. OAG 69-189.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute is broad enough to authorize a county judge (now county judge/executive) to permit a 14-year-old girl who has given birth to a child to marry the alleged father of the illegitimate child, since the statute does not require the condition of pregnancy coexist with the application to marry. OAG 69-470.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The three-day waiting period required by KRS 402.080 is applicable to a license issued pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (5) (now (1)3.) of this section permitting the issuance of a license with the permission of the court in the event of the pregnancy of the female. OAG 70-22.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A boy under 18 years of age cannot be issued a marriage license with the written consent of his parents where pregnancy is not involved. OAG 71-125.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires that the female be pregnant at the time an application is made and, therefore, it does not apply where the child of the female making such application is in fact eight months old. OAG 72-553. (But see OAG 69-470.)</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was no indication that the 14-year-old female was pregnant when the application for marriage was made and the child of the couple involved was six months of age and the underage female was not a resident of Kentucky, a marriage license could not be legally issued to this couple. OAG 73-725. (But see OAG 69-470.)</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a pregnant girl under 18 applies to county judge (now county judge/executive) for a marriage license under subsection (4) (now (1)3.), the application should be made in the county of the girl’s residence as required by KRS 402.080. OAG 74-295.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a pregnant female under the age of 18 cannot obtain the consent of a parent or guardian as required by KRS 402.210, she may apply under subsection (4) (now (1)3.) or KRS 402.150 (repealed) to the county judge (now county judge/executive) for permission to marry. OAG 74-524.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an unmarried female under the age of 18 who has just had a child cannot procure consent of her parents under KRS 402.210, she is not qualified to apply to the county judge (now county judge/executive) under this section for an order granting the permission to get married since the term “pregnancy” mentioned in subsection (4) (now (1)3.) simply means physically and actually pregnant at the time the application for permission to marry is made. OAG 74-607.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regardless of the age of a person under 18, such person may legally apply for a marriage license provided he procures the consent of one of the parents or the guardian. OAG 74-607.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If either applicant for a marriage license is under 18 and the girl is pregnant and one of the parents or the guardian of the applicant under 18 gives consent, then it is not necessary for the applicants to apply to the county judge (now county judge/executive) for permission to marry. OAG 74-674.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As concerns applicants for a marriage license under 18, there is no longer any minimum age since the consent of either parent or guardian takes care of the age factor. OAG 74-674.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the clerk has any valid reason, after a discussion with the applicants, to believe that one or both of the applicants is married to another without a final decree of divorce being effectively entered, then the clerk should not issue the license in view of this section. OAG 78-431.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A divorced girl under 18 does not require the consent of her father, mother, or guardian in making her application for marriage since KRS 402.210 makes it clear that it is only where the applicant is under 18 and not before married that parental or a guardian’s consent is required. OAG 80-138.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The General Assembly in this section expressed a sensitive and social concern about the marriages of persons of tender age; accordingly, the county clerk may require that the applicants for marriage produce for copying a driver’s license, or a birth certificate or copy thereof, or in lieu of any of the above an affidavit of the parents or guardian as to the specific age of the applicants. OAG 82-453.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While there is no express statutory provision covering the proof of age of applicants for a marriage license, any reasonable requirement of the clerk as to proof of age would be upheld by the courts. In order for the legislative intent expressed in KRS 402.210, 402.080, and this section to be practically accomplished, the strong implication is that any reasonable kind of proof of age would be upheld by the courts. OAG 82-453.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The literal language of subdivision (4) (now (1)3.) of this section, as relates to the language, “in case of pregnancy,” means that the under age female has to be pregnant at the time the application is made in order for her to be married over her parents’ refusal of permission; accordingly, where an unmarried 17-year-old had already had her baby, she was simply no longer pregnant and, therefore, she could not get married without the consent of her parents. OAG 83-109.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State universities may extend employee health insurance coverage to “domestic partners” or any other persons, but may not condition such benefits upon a legal status defined in a manner substantially similar to that of marriage, since this would constitute the recognition of such a legal status in contravention of Ky. Const. § 233A. If domestic partnership is not defined in terms of a legal status similar to marriage, but is defined in a more inclusive manner, extending such benefits would be constitutional.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a religious society has no regular place of worship and such worship takes place in the various homes of the believers, the home of one such believer could be designated as a place in which a marriage ceremony is to be held and this would satisfy the requirement of subsection (1)(c) of this section as to “the usual place of worship.” OAG 72-805.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A justice of the peace who has been properly authorized to solemnize marriages either by the governor or the county court may solemnize marriages in any county in the Commonwealth regardless of whether the license is acquired in the county where the marriage is solemnized or another county, but the return of the license and certificate must be made to the county clerk who issued the license.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Being a minister in regular communion with his religious society is one of the conditions required under KRS 402.060 (repealed) in order to be issued a license to solemnize marriages and if a group is organized and maintained for the support of public worship of God and the applicant is recognized as a minister of such group, and the minister is actively engaged in such ministry, he would qualify as a minister. OAG 76-603.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The point of qualification for a minister or priest is that he must be a minister of the gospel of any denomination in regular communion with any religious society, but a particular ritual of ordainment is not a statutory prerequisite. OAG 77-326.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>County judges/executive and justices of the peace can continue to solemnize marriages as a nonjudicial function. OAG 78-33.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of any statutory provisions for a fee for solemnizing a marriage, any money for it is purely a matter of gift. OAG 78-57.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since performing a marriage is not a judicial act, a justice of the peace can perform marriages provided he has proper written authorization. OAG 78-57.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A “religious society” in Kentucky is a broad term and includes any group organized and maintained for the support of public worship of God and the recognition of a minister can take the form of ordination or license or any other form which expresses clearly the fact that the religious group recognizes the person or looks to the person as a minister of that specific group. OAG 78-303.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in this section suggesting that a minister must be ordained and it establishes no criterion as to the meaning of the phrase “minister of the gospel,” therefore in each case we must look to the particular church group with which the applicant is affiliated; in other words the matter of who is a minister of the religious society is left wholly to the recognition of the particular denomination or organization. OAG 78-303.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A justice of the peace can solemnize marriages, provided that it is authorized by the governor of Kentucky or the county judge/executive of his county by way of an appropriate executive order. OAG 78-642.</p>

OAG 80-256.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A deputy county judge/executive, as such, has no authority to solemnize a marriage in Kentucky. OAG 82-145.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an urban county the power to authorize justices of the peace to solemnize marriages exists in the county judge/executive, pursuant to this section and there is no law that would permit the mayor of urban county government to exercise such authority; of course where the governor has previously authorized one or more of the justices of the peace to perform marriages, the county judge/executive’s authority would be nullified to that extent, since the statute does not envision the duplication of the authority to permit justices of the peace to solemnize marriages. OAG 82-164.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The authority of a county judge/executive in an urban county to authorize a person to solemnize marriages applies exclusively to the justice of the peace in that county and not to county commissioners, pursuant to subdivision (1)(b) of this section. OAG 82-164.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not a general law relating to city or county government but is merely a law dealing with the subject of those persons or officials who can perform marriages; thus the marriage ceremony by one qualified by statute to solemnize the marriage does not relate to county or city governmental action, as such. OAG 82-164.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A justice of the peace may perform marriages if he is expressly authorized to do so in writing by the Governor of Kentucky or the county judge/executive of his county. Such authority should take the form of an executive order as applies to the Governor and the county judge/executive. The original order should be filed in the county clerk’s office. OAG 82-453.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the charge or money received by a county judge/executive for marrying people is not for a governmental service, it belongs to the county judge/executive as a private asset and he is not required to account for that money to the fiscal court or county treasurer. OAG 83-122.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county judge/executive, in performing marriages under subsection (1) of this section, may receive whatever reasonable amount of money (it is not a fee in the governmental sense) the married parties may wish to give him. While a minister or other official is generally given a small fee for performing a marriage ceremony, such a fee is not authorized by statute or required by any law and cannot be forced as a condition to the performance of marriage under existing law. OAG 83-122.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Canadian citizen, who was an ordained minister, within the meaning of subdivision (1)(a) of this section, and who resided in Kentucky, could lawfully apply to the county judge/executive for the issuance of a license to solemnize marriages, pursuant to KRS 402.060 (repealed) and could then conduct marriages in Kentucky by himself.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where minister, on the basis of presented license of marriage, performed marriage ceremony and completed the certificates mentioned in KRS 402.100, but in returning the certificate to the clerk, the license-certificate was lost in the mail, in view of the public policy favoring marriage, clerk could issue a certified “duplicate” marriage license to the parties, which could then be delivered to the solemnizing minister for filling out the subject certificates and returning such duplicate license for filing; after first requiring the minister and the wedded parties to sign an affidavit, to be filed with clerk, stating that the minister did on a certain day take the original marriage license and solemnize the marriage between the subject parties.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statute disqualifying nonresidents as such from applying for a marriage license in Kentucky; nonresidents may apply for a marriage license in any county in Kentucky provided they comply with applicable statutory law. OAG 74-295 modified OAG 82-416.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The General Assembly in KRS 402.020 expressed a sensitive and social concern about the marriages of persons of tender age; accordingly, the county clerk may require that the applicants for marriage produce for copying a driver’s license, or a birth certificate or copy thereof, or in lieu of any of the above an affidavit of the parents or guardian as to the specific age of the applicants. OAG 82-453.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While there is no express statutory provision covering the proof of age of applicants for a marriage license, any reasonable requirement of the clerk as to proof of age would be upheld by the courts. In order for the legislative intent expressed in KRS 402.020, 402.210, and this section to be practically accomplished, the strong implication is that any reasonable kind of proof of age would be upheld by the courts. OAG 82-453.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In considering that the statutes contain no maximum time during which the application for a marriage license may remain on file, and considering that under KRS 402.190 (repealed and reenacted as KRS 402.105) a marriage license is valid for 30 days, including the date of issue, it appears that the marriage license, assuming that any pertinent marriage statutes have been complied with, should be issued by the clerk within a reasonable time after the three-day waiting period; a “reasonable time” would probably be a rather short period of time, perhaps a period of 30 days. OAG 83-359.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The three-day waiting period is mandatory. OAG 84-79.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the deputy clerk intentionally backdates a marriage application in order to avoid the three-day waiting period of this section, and where the county clerk has no actual knowledge of such wrongful issue until after the issuance has been effected, and the clerk has no reasonable opportunity to retrieve the wrongfully issued license prior to the solemnizing of marriage, the county clerk would not be subject to the penalty described in KRS 402.990(9). A repetition of this offense by the deputy would warrant the clerk’s dismissal of the deputy, where the offense is made known to the clerk, and if the offense is allowed to be repeated, the clerk could be charged under KRS 402.990(9). OAG 84-79.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a county clerk’s deputy deliberately backdates a marriage application in order to avoid the three-day waiting period, the clerk’s failure to take action against the deputy and failure to explain the circumstances when mailing the application to the Department of Human Resources as required under either KRS 213.330 (repealed), for purposes of vital statistics records, or KRS 402.340, in connection with the sickle cell detection program, would not be relevant to the clerk’s liability under the penalty provision of KRS 402.990(9). OAG 84-79.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 402.990 clearly differentiates between issuing a marriage license to persons prohibited by this chapter and issuing a license in violation of this chapter; since a license issued in violation of the three-day waiting period constitutes a violation of the chapter, but not an issuance to persons prohibited to marry, the penalty of KRS 402.990(8) would not be applicable.

<p class="p7"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A parent can give his consent to the marriage of his child who is under 21 years of age even though the parent or guardian is not himself a resident of Kentucky. OAG 62-662.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is sufficient if the father who is a nonresident of this state mails to the clerk his consent in writing signed by him with his signature being attested to by two subscribing witnesses. OAG 62-662.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Consent of the parents to the marriage of minor children as provided by KRS 402.210 is not required in order for the county clerk to issue a marriage license, where a Circuit Judge has issued an order under KRS 402.020(5) (now KRS 402.020(1)(f)3.) giving the parties, upon their application, permission to marry based on a finding that the boy is 17 years of age and the girl is 15 and pregnant. OAG 62-876.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absence of parental consent does not invalidate a marriage otherwise duly performed. OAG 63-982.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not changed by KRS 2.015. OAG 64-503.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bond provision only applies to parties under the age of consent. OAG 66-730.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a bond is proper under the statute, the signing of a bond can be properly accomplished through a power of attorney. OAG 66-730.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the nonresident father of a boy under age 21 (now 18) to give his consent so that a marriage license may be issued to his son in Kentucky, either the father must appear personally before the county court clerk in Kentucky who issues the license or one of the two subscribing witnesses to the father’s signature on the written consent must personally appear before the Kentucky court clerk issuing the license. OAG 68-94.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 402.020(5) (now KRS 402.020(4)) permits application to the county judge (now county judge/executive) for permission to marry where either of the parties is under the required age and the female is pregnant, where the pregnancy has ripened into the birth of a living child, the license cannot be validly procured unless the consent procedure set forth in this section is followed, upon the girl’s reaching the age of 16. OAG 68-100.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After June 13, 1968, the effective date of KRS 402.210, persons who have reached the age of 18 years will be legally entitled to apply for a marriage license without their parents’ consent. OAG 68-219.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 402.210 means that persons 18 or over may apply for marriage license without observing the consent procedure and is not in conflict with KRS 402.020 which prohibits marriage where the male is under 18. OAG 68-226.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 2.015 is not controlling of the consent procedure outlined in KRS 402.210. OAG 68-262.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The age requirements of this section are applicable to both residents and nonresidents. OAG 68-499.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute does not authorize issuance of a marriage license to a male under the age of 18, even though a consent could be obtained. OAG 69-388.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision in this section for the giving of bond where the parties are personally unknown to the clerk applies only where one of the parties to the marriage is under the legal age or where there is some reason to believe that this may be the case. OAG 69-411.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not authorize the issuance of a license where the male is under 18 and no pregnancy is involved, even though consent could be obtained. OAG 71-125.</p>

In the event the laboratory tests indicate that both applicants are carriers of a trait or disease, the physician may provide genetic counseling or refer the applicants to the cabinet or to an agency approved by the cabinet for such counseling.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> The fiscal court of any county may, by resolution, authorize the appointment of a “friend of the court.” If the Circuit Court of the county has but one (1) judge, the appointment shall be made by the judge. If the court has two (2) or more judges, the appointment shall be made by joint action of the judges, at the general term. The person appointed to the office of friend of the court shall serve at the pleasure of, and subject to removal by, the appointing authority. The person appointed shall be a licensed practicing attorney. The appointed person shall take the constitutional oath of office and shall give bond in such sum as may be fixed by the appointing judge or judges.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Except for those cases administered pursuant to 42 U.S.C. secs. 651 et seq., it shall be the duty of the friend of the court to supervise and enforce the payment of sums ordered or adjudged by the Circuit Court in divorce actions to be paid for the care and maintenance of minor children. All persons who have been ordered or adjudged by the court, in connection with divorce actions, to make payments for the care and maintenance of children, shall, if so ordered by the court, make such payments to the friend of the court. The friend of the court shall see that the payments, except for those cases administered pursuant to 42 U.S.C. secs. 651 et seq., are properly applied in accordance with the order or judgment. However, if the court so directs, the payments may be made through the juvenile session of District Court of the county; in such case the friend of the court shall render such assistance as may be required in keeping records concerning such payments and in the enforcement of delinquent payments, and the Circuit Court may direct that a designated amount or portion of the funds appropriated by the fiscal court for expenses of the friend of the court be paid to the juvenile session of District Court as reimbursement for the expenses incurred by the juvenile session of District Court in connection with the handling of such payments. The friend of the court shall promptly investigate all cases where payments have become delinquent, and when necessary shall cause the delinquent person to be brought before the court for the purpose of compelling payment. The friend of the court shall ascertain the facts concerning the care, custody, and maintenance of children for whom payments are being made, and shall report to the court all cases in which the children are not receiving proper care or maintenance, or in which the person having custody is failing to furnish proper custody. He shall make such other reports to the court as the court may require.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> In the event that a waiver is granted under 42 U.S.C. secs. 651 et seq., allowing payment of wage withholding collections to be directed to the friend of the court, an obligor shall be given the option of payment either to the friend of the court or the centralized collection agency.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> In any action for divorce where the parties have minor children, the friend of the court, if requested by the trial judge, shall make such investigation as will enable the friend of the court to ascertain all facts and circumstances that will affect the rights and interests of the children and will enable the court to enter just and proper orders and judgment concerning the care, custody, and maintenance of the children. The friend of the court shall make a report to the trial judge, at a time fixed by the judge, setting forth recommendations as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the children. The friend of the court may request the court to postpone the final submission of any case to give the friend of the court a reasonable time in which to complete the investigation.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> The friend of the court shall have authority to secure the issuance by the court of any order, rule, or citation necessary for the proper enforcement of orders and judgments in divorce actions concerning the custody, care, and maintenance of children. In performing duties under subsection (4) of this section the friend of the court shall attend the taking of depositions within the county, and shall have authority to cross-examine the witnesses. In the case of depositions taken on interrogatories, the friend of the court may file cross-interrogatories. The friend of the court shall be duly notified of the time and place of the taking of depositions in all divorce actions where the parties have minor children, and shall attend the taking of all such depositions when the friend of the court deems it necessary for the protection of the minor children, or when the friend of the court may be directed by the court to attend.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> The friend of the court shall not directly or indirectly represent any party to a divorce action except as herein authorized to represent the minor children of parties to a divorce action, but if an allowance is made for the support of a spouse and an infant child or children, may proceed to enforce the payment of the allowance made to the spouse also.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> Where a friend of the court is acting as a designee of the cabinet pursuant to KRS 205.712 and an applicant for Title IV-D services pursuant to KRS 205.721 has requested a modification of an existing child support order pursuant to a divorce or other judicial order, the friend of the court shall seek the modification, providing all jurisdictional requirements are met. The friend of the court’s representation shall extend only for the limited purpose of seeking a modification of an existing child support order consistent with the provisions of KRS 403.212.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> The fiscal court of any county which has authorized the appointment of a friend of the court under this section shall, by resolution, fix a reasonable compensation for the friend of the court and make a reasonable allowance for necessary expenses, equipment, and supplies, payable out of the general fund of the county, upon approval of the appointing judge or judges.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given the nature of the no-fault divorce statute, coupled with the desirability of imparting some degree of finality to settlement agreements, a party challenging an agreement as unconscionable should have a relatively high burden of proof, and since the trial court is in the best position to judge the circumstances surrounding a separation agreement, its finding on the issue of conscionability should not be set aside on appeal unless there is some evidence of fraud, undue influence, overreaching, or evidence of a change of circumstances since the execution of the original agreement.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The marital relation is a sacred one, and should not be dissolved, unless the grounds authorizing it are clearly established. Bone v. Bone, 200 Ky. 736, 255 S.W. 530, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 176 (Ky. 1923) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bonds of matrimony should not be severed because one or the other spouse has shortcomings. Dean v. Dean, 314 Ky. 872, 238 S.W.2d 672, 1951 Ky. LEXIS 821 (Ky. 1951) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Procedure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decree of dissolution of the marriage could be entered prior to the final disposition of the matters enumerated in this section. Putnam v. Fanning, 495 S.W.2d 175, 1973 Ky. LEXIS 391 (Ky. 1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Legal Separation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court found that there had been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage and where the husband objected to the request which the wife had made for a legal separation, the trial court was required by this section to dissolve the marriage rather than adjudge a legal separation. Smith v. Smith, 497 S.W.2d 418, 1973 Ky. LEXIS 323 (Ky. 1973).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the trial court clearly erred by finding that the marriage was not irretrievably broken, then under CR 52.01 his findings may be set aside and if the evidence admits of but one conclusion, that is that the marriage is irretrievably broken, dissolution of the marriage must be granted. Laffosse v. Laffosse, 564 S.W.2d 220, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 497 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where both parties testified that the marriage was irretrievably broken and the wife indicated that she wanted a legal separation, rather than dissolution, simply to give her financial security, the trial court’s finding that the marriage was not irretrievably broken was clearly erroneous and would be reversed and remanded with directions to dissolve the marriage. Laffosse v. Laffosse, 564 S.W.2d 220, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 497 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>6. Jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1)(d) of this section is neither a grant nor a withdrawal of jurisdiction, but merely requires the trial court to dispose of issues of custody, support, maintenance and property division, if it otherwise has jurisdiction to do so, when it enters a decree of dissolution of marriage. Hall v. Hall, 585 S.W.2d 384, 1979 Ky. LEXIS 272 (Ky. 1979).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinarily, actual residence in the state for the requisite statutory period is required before a dissolution action may be maintained; however, there is an exception to that rule when the divorcing parties’ absence from the state is temporary in nature. McGowan v. McGowan, 663 S.W.2d 219, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 383 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the parties left Kentucky so that husband could receive advanced training in oral surgery, but they used wife’s parents’ Kentucky address as their permanent address, registered and insured their car in Kentucky, kept Kentucky drivers’ licenses and indicated that they hoped to return to Kentucky, the evidence showed that, at the time the parties left, they only intended to be temporarily absent from this jurisdiction; therefore, the court’s finding that the 180-day residence requirement had been met was not erroneous. McGowan v. McGowan, 663 S.W.2d 219, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 383 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the question of jurisdictional residence is raised in the lower court, the lower court’s determination that it has jurisdiction cannot be questioned if there is any evidence to show the necessary residence. Karahalios v. Karahalios, 848 S.W.2d 457, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 39 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As it was undisputed that a former wife had lived in Kentucky for 180 days before she filed for divorce, even assuming that she fraudulently alleged her former husband had lived there for 180 days as well — an assumption that found no support in the record — the Kentucky Circuit Court had subject matter over the parties’ divorce action under KRS 403.140(1)(a). Jeffrey v. Jeffrey, 153 S.W.3d 849, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although she resided in St. Maarten for much of the marriage, at the time the husband filed his petition, there was absolutely no evidence that it was the wife’s intent to establish permanent residency in that country and abandon her Kentucky domicile; thus, the Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties to grant the dissolution under KRS 403.140. Fehr v. Fehr, 284 S.W.3d 149, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 306 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over the parties’ divorce proceedings despite the fact that they had been absent from the state because the parties left Kentucky for the husband to receive advanced training in oral surgery but they planned to return, used a Kentucky address as their permanent address, registered and insured their car in Kentucky, and kept Kentucky drivers’ licenses, thus, only being temporarily absent and permitting jurisdiction. Brockman v. Brockman, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 11 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2019), review denied, ordered not published, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 193 (Ky. June 5, 2019).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The concept of “team or joint efforts” is not germane to the determination of whether property is marital or not; at most it may convert the increase in value of nonmarital property into marital property. Stallings v. Stallings, 606 S.W.2d 163, 1980 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1980).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Property acquired by a married person after an “actual” vis-a-vis “legal” separation is marital property. Stallings v. Stallings, 606 S.W.2d 163, 1980 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1980).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Requirement of former section governing proof of divorce was that of an actual, rather than legal, residence. Tipton v. Tipton, 87 Ky. 243, 8 S.W. 440, 10 Ky. L. Rptr. 252, 1888 Ky. LEXIS 72 (Ky. 1888) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Actual residence, as opposed to legal residence or domicile, is necessary to give the court jurisdiction of divorce suit. Lanham v. Lanham, 300 Ky. 237, 188 S.W.2d 439, 1945 Ky. LEXIS 529 (Ky. 1945) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8">(7/14/2000). Although House Committee Amendment 1 (adopted by the House of Representatives and concurred in by the Senate) to the General Assembly version of Senate Bill 218 eliminated a new paragraph (c) in KRS 403.212(2) that had required a conforming amendment to this statute to change a cross-reference from “KRS 403.212(2)(g)” to “KRS 403.212(2)(h)” in subsection (2)(a) of this statute, the conforming amendment was not corrected in the floor amendment. Because of this omission and because of the context of the cross-reference, the change in subsection (2)(a) of this statute constitutes a manifest clerical or typographical error and has not been included in codification.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decree of dissolution of the marriage could be entered prior to the determination of maintenance. Putnam v. Fanning, 495 S.W.2d 175, 1973 Ky. LEXIS 391 (Ky. 1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Temporary Maintenance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a husband made monthly payments to the wife that were more than the husband was ordered to pay for temporary maintenance, it was error to find that the husband owed a maintenance arrearage. There was no statutory requirement that temporary maintenance be paid out of non-marital property and the husband used a portion of what was later determined to be the wife’s share of monthly consulting payments to satisfy the husband’s temporary maintenance obligation to the wife. Horvath v. Horvath, 250 S.W.3d 316, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 103 (Ky. 2008).</p>

Blackburn, 198 Ky. 12, 247 S.W. 1111, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 370 (Ky. 1923) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The allowance of alimony pendente lite, or pending appeal, is within the sound discretion of the court and therefore cannot be controlled by writ of mandamus.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considerations involved in setting an amount of temporary alimony include the husband’s income, estate, and earning capacity, the wife’s age, health, dependence and station in life, the custody of the children and the reasons for which the suit for alimony was brought.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In fixing the amount of the allowance to the wife pending divorce, many elements must be considered by the court, such as the financial condition of the respective parties and the wife’s age, health, and station in life. Brandenburg v. Brandenburg, 246 Ky. 546, 55 S.W.2d 351, 1932 Ky. LEXIS 786 (Ky. 1932) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Standard by which temporary alimony is to be fixed is the husband’s ability and the wife’s necessities measured by the social position in which her marriage placed her.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the provisions for modification of separation agreements would not be valid to the extent of impairing vested contractual rights, a wife’s contractual right to maintenance could not be impaired by court modification where the right to alimony had vested in her as a result of alimony provisions attendant to the property settlement incorporated in a 1968 divorce decree. Scott v. Scott, 529 S.W.2d 656, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 60 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court was clearly erroneous in reducing a husband’s maintenance obligation by the amount of the wife’s Social Security benefits as 53 percent of the wife’s benefits were attributable to her earnings; as the maintenance obligation was established in 1979, the pre-1972 modification rules were applicable, and whether the maintenance obligation was subject to modification depended on application of KRS 403.180 and KRS 403.250. Wheeler v. Wheeler, 154 S.W.3d 291, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 84 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In light of the conflicting testimony of the parties where both parents alleged that they had custody of the minor daughter more than 50% of the time, it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the family court to modify the agreement of the parties and to recalculate child support without reference to the split custody arrangement the parties originally envisioned in the original dissolution decree. Johnson v. Johnson, 232 S.W.3d 571, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 303 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Changed circumstances rendering the terms of a maintenance award unconscionable is the only ground upon which a court has authority to modify any maintenance award; however, the clear language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.250(1) prohibits a court from invoking this limited authority when the parties have a separation agreement pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.180(6) that expressly precluded subsequent modification of the terms of their separation agreement. Jaburg v. Jaburg, 558 S.W.3d 11, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 227 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not have the authority to modify a husband’s maintenance obligations under a marital settlement agreement because its finding that it could modify the settlement agreement due to changed circumstances despite the presence of non-modification clauses was erroneous.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decision to deny the husband’s motion to modify maintenance was not an abuse of discretion; the maintenance amount set in the separation agreement was a bargained-for exchange as the wife, who was disabled, waived her claim to the husband’s retirement accounts, and while he had some unemployment, he failed to show that his circumstances was anything other than temporary, not substantial and continuing, and he voluntarily created his exorbitant monthly expenses. His accumulation of debt was not directly related to his change in jobs. Andrews v. Andrews, 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 82 (Ky. Ct. App. July 10, 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the final decree of dissolution of marriage incorporated the separation agreement, the agreement was found by the trial court that entered the dissolution decree not to have been unconscionable, such that any modification was impermissible absent a showing of a change in circumstances; accordingly, a Family Court should not have applied principles of equity in interpreting and enforcing the agreement, but rather, the agreement should have been enforced as if it was a contract pursuant to KRS 403.180(2) and (5).

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> In a proceeding for dissolution of the marriage or for legal separation, or in a proceeding for disposition of property following dissolution of the marriage by a court which lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse or lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the property, the court shall assign each spouse’s property to him. It also shall divide the marital property without regard to marital misconduct in just proportions considering all relevant factors including:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Contribution of each spouse to acquisition of the marital property, including contribution of a spouse as homemaker;</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> For the purpose of this chapter, “marital property” means all property acquired by either spouse subsequent to the marriage except:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent during the marriage and the income derived therefrom unless there are significant activities of either spouse which contributed to the increase in value of said property and the income earned therefrom;</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> All property acquired by either spouse after the marriage and before a decree of legal separation is presumed to be marital property, regardless of whether title is held individually or by the spouses in some form of co-ownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety, and community property. The presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> If the retirement benefits of one spouse are excepted from classification as marital property, or not considered as an economic circumstance during the division of marital property, then the retirement benefits of the other spouse shall also be excepted, or not considered, as the case may be. However, the level of exception provided to the spouse with the greater retirement benefit shall not exceed the level of exception provided to the other spouse. Retirement benefits, for the purposes of this subsection shall include retirement or disability allowances, accumulated contributions, or any other benefit of a retirement system or plan regulated by the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or of a public retirement system administered by an agency of a state or local government, including deferred compensation plans created pursuant to KRS 18A.230 to 18A.275 or defined contribution or money purchase plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the “source of funds” rule to determine whether property is marital or nonmarital, the property is considered to be acquired as it is paid for; characterization of property as nonmarital or marital depends upon the source of each contribution as payments are made rather than the time at which equitable title to possession of the property is obtained. Under this analysis, the shares of stock sold to the corporation in the 1996 stock redemption agreement were not “acquired,” within the meaning of KRS 403.190 until they were paid for. These shares were paid for during the marriage over a period of years by corporate earnings. Thus, they were “acquired” during the marriage. Because the shares were “acquired” during the marriage, there is a presumption that they are marital property. Allison v. Allison, 246 S.W.3d 898, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 35 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>

The character and purpose of this action rendered it a civil rather than a criminal contempt proceeding. The act of disobedience consisted solely in refusing to do what had been ordered and not in doing something that had been prohibited. The order imposed conditional imprisonment for the very obvious purpose of compelling the former spouse to obey (pay) the order of the court or plan for payment. Blakeman v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) of this section provides that the circumstances considered as extraordinary shall be determined by the court in its discretion and clearly the guidelines are not designed to cover all the possible scenarios in which divorcing parents find themselves; the legislature has not taken away the trial court’s broad discretion in ensuring that the needs of their children will continue to be met. Redmon v. Redmon, 823 S.W.2d 463, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 18 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where unusual circumstances exist which are not specifically provided for in the statute, the Legislature has provided that trial courts should exercise their discretion to achieve just results. But a trial court does not have the discretion to deviate from the guidelines simply because it thinks the Legislature erred in setting the appropriate levels. Nor does it have the discretion to ignore the guidelines because it feels that important factors were ignored by the Legislature. Keplinger v. Keplinger, 839 S.W.2d 566, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 195 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court has the flexibility to fashion appropriate orders for situations not addressed by the current statutory scheme. Brown v. Brown, 952 S.W.2d 707, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 95 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court’s refusal to require father to pay child support was not clearly erroneous where children resided with father 60% of the time and father, as primary custodian, had an ongoing obligation to maintain a residence for the children on a permanent basis, regardless of the amount of time that they spent with their mother. Brown v. Brown, 952 S.W.2d 707, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 95 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Supreme Court found that KRS 403.212(2)(f) imposed a mandatory obligation on parents to report and verify their income but that trial courts could consider evidence not provided in a parent’s statement of income when determining a parent’s child support obligation, and although the Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s decision to consider whether a wife had sources of income other than those the wife reported, it affirmed the intermediate appellate court’s judgment vacating the trial court’s judgment awarding neither the wife nor the wife’s husband child support because the record did not support the trial court’s judgment imputing income to the wife. Schoenbachler v. Minyard, 110 S.W.3d 776, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 82 (Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Visitation is not a factor to be considered in setting an amount of child support. Dickens v. Dickens, 401 S.W.3d 489, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 79 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court of Kentucky concludes that trial courts have the discretion to award a credit for Social Security retirement benefits paid to the dependent child. This authority does not stem from Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.211(15) but from a trial court's general authority and discretion to determine child-support questions. C.D.G. v. N.J.S., 469 S.W.3d 413, 2015 Ky. LEXIS 1763 (Ky. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Authority of Cabinet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Cabinet for Families and Children had authority to intervene to seek a modification of a final order terminating child support, and was not required to file an independent action. Berry v. Cabinet for Families &amp; Children, 998 S.W.2d 464, 1999 Ky. LEXIS 86 (Ky. 1999).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a county attorney failed to submit any application to intervene on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Cabinet was not properly before the family court. Its motion to set child support was thus ineffectual, and, as a result, the family court should have entered no order of child support. Boggs v. Commonwealth ex rel. Boggs, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 133 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 2012), review denied, ordered not published, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 188 (Ky. Feb. 13, 2013).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father of an illegitimate child, although lacking the statutorily-defined capacity to consent to sexual relations on the date a child is conceived, may be adjudged liable in a civil paternity action for the years subsequent to the date upon which the father reaches the age of majority. Commonwealth ex rel. Rush v. Hatfield, 929 S.W.2d 200, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 148 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Assets of Noncustodial Parent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The child support guidelines, which are exclusively tied to income, are not appropriate where the noncustodial parent has no income, but may have sufficient assets from which support can be obtained; therefore where incarcerated father did not claim to be indigent, nor did he state he had no property to satisfy the support obligation, his children should not have to bear additional deprivation in the form of a reduced standard of living if the father has property, or potential sources of assets, which could be liquidated to satisfy any support delinquency or arrearage. Redmon v. Redmon, 823 S.W.2d 463, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 18 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supplemental security income (SSI) benefits paid to a child because of his own disability may be considered as independent financial resources of the child in determining the parental support obligation and in determining whether application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate as considering SSI in the child’s name is consistent with considering social security benefits in the parent’s gross income. The child’s independent benefits would merely be recognized in weighing the equities and fairness of the circumstances of the child and the parents. Barker v. Hill, 949 S.W.2d 896, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 70 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although combined monthly adjusted parental gross income in excess of the child support guidelines is a valid basis for deviating from the child support table, and a trial court may use its judicial discretion to determine child support in circumstances where combined adjusted parental gross income exceeds the uppermost level of the guidelines table, a trial court erred when it based the amount of child support to be paid by a former husband who earned $57,000 per month almost entirely on a mathematical extrapolation from the child support guidelines. Downing v. Downing, 45 S.W.3d 449, 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001), limited, Conley v. Conley, 2008 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 975 (Ky. Ct. App. May 16, 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a divorce settlement agreement provided that the father’s federal income tax returns would be used to determine his income, and that his children would receive 30 percent of the proceeds from his said salary and bonus, his “income” was his salary and bonus less deductions for taxes (but not for voluntary payments, such as 401K contributions) — in other words, his “net income.” Pursley v. Pursley, 144 S.W.3d 820, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 225 (Ky. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly determined unvested restricted stock units would not be considered part of a husband’s income for the purpose of calculating child support because it was not required to do award more than the guidelines recommended; the trial court found the children all participated in one normal extra-curricular activity each, attended public school, and did not have any extraordinary medical needs. Normandin v. Normandin, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 176 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2018 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 960 (Ky. Ct. App. June 1, 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the combined gross monthly income captured all sources of income available to the parties including bonuses, restricted stock units (RSUs), and maintenance, the ex-husband’s RSU income should have been included in the income calculation for child support purposes, and the trial court erred in not doing so. Normandin v. Normandin, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 456 (Ky. Dec. 17, 2020).</p>

Youngblood v. James, 883 S.W.2d 512, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 114 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Provisions of KRS 403.211 did not authorize a court to credit against a parent’s child support obligation the retirement dependent benefit that the child received based upon the child’s receipt of Social Security retirement benefits on account of the other parent. N.J.S. v. C.D.G., 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 49 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2014 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 830 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 21, 2014).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where trial court sought to justify its decision by referring to the uncertain nature of father’s work, although that factor might properly have been taken into account in setting a schedule for payments (e.g. by having father make payments at one level when working and at another level when laid off, as was done by the trial court in a previous order), under the facts of this case, it was not an “extraordinary factor” justifying departure from the guidelines. Keplinger v. Keplinger, 839 S.W.2d 566, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 195 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The incarceration of the obligor parent is not an extraordinary circumstance within the meaning of this section and does not relieve him or her from the obligation to pay child support. Commonwealth ex rel. Marshall v. Marshall, 15 S.W.3d 396, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 26 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an imputed monthly child support obligation for a prior-born child that was considered as part of the mother’s income calculation created an extraordinary hardship on the father or the father’s after-born child, the court had authority to permit deviation from the guidelines, pursuant to KRS 403.211(2) and (3). Kimbrough v. Child Support Div. ex rel. Belmar, 215 S.W.3d 69, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 226 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in finding there was no legal justification for ordering an ex-husband to pay half the funeral expenses for his only son as it would offend equity and would be unjust not to have the ex-husband pay half of the funeral expenses after collecting death benefits based upon his son’s death. Jewell v. Jewell, 255 S.W.3d 522, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 162 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court found that the mandatory field trip costs were required for the child’s participation in class and that non-mandatory field trip costs were a special need of the child, and the court found no abuse of discretion or clear error; the trial court’s acceptance of the father’s testimony as more credible met the substantial evidence requirement for its ruling. Bjelland v. Bjelland, 408 S.W.3d 86, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 121 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

Therefore, a trial court erred by deviating from the guidelines in determining the child support obligation of a noncustodial mother based on the payments of such benefits to the children of a custodial father.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> “Income” means actual gross income of the parent if employed to full capacity or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> “Gross income” includes income from any source, except as excluded in this subsection, and includes but is not limited to income from salaries, wages, retirement and pension funds, commissions, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains, Social Security benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), gifts, prizes, and alimony or maintenance received. Specifically excluded are benefits received from means-tested public assistance programs, including but not limited to public assistance as defined under Title IV-A of the Federal Social Security Act, and food stamps.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> For income from self-employment, rent, royalties, proprietorship of a business, or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation, “gross income” means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation. Straight-line depreciation, using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines, shall be the only allowable method of calculating depreciation expense in determining gross income. Specifically excluded from ordinary and necessary expenses for purposes of this guideline shall be investment tax credits or any other business expenses inappropriate for determining gross income for purposes of calculating child support. Income and expenses from self-employment or operation of a business shall be carefully reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation. In most cases, this amount will differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes. Expense reimbursement or in-kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self-employment, or operation of a business or personal use of business property or payments of expenses by a business, shall be counted as income if they are significant and reduce personal living expenses such as a company or business car, free housing, reimbursed meals, or club dues.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> If a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support shall be calculated based on a determination of potential income, except that a determination of potential income shall not be made for a parent who is incarcerated, physically or mentally incapacitated, or is caring for a very young child, age three (3) or younger, for whom the parents owe a joint legal responsibility. Potential income shall be determined based upon employment potential and probable earnings level based on the obligor’s or obligee’s recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earnings levels in the community. A court may find a parent to be voluntarily unemployed or underemployed without finding that the parent intended to avoid or reduce the child support obligation.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A finding of bad faith is required under this section to find an individual to be voluntarily underemployed even though the statutory language makes no mention of a bad faith requirement. McKinney v. McKinney, 813 S.W.2d 828, 1991 Ky. App. LEXIS 115 (Ky. Ct. App. 1991).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Circuit Court erred in concluding that a father was entitled to a reduction of his child support obligation as a matter of law, notwithstanding that he was still employed on a full-time basis, where (1) for a considerable period prior to the parties’ separation, the father had a full-time job and a second part-time job, and (2) the father’s income decreased because he voluntarily quit his part-time job and because he was not working as much overtime as before at his primary job; on remand, the Circuit Court would be required to make explicit findings concerning the circumstances surrounding the father’s reduction in his income and to determine whether to impute income to him. Gossett v. Gossett, 32 S.W.3d 109, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 120 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the evidence might support a finding that the husband was voluntarily underemployed, the trial court erred in basing its finding that a husband was underemployed for purposes of determining child support under KRS 403.212(2)(d) on federal statistics where: (1) the certified public accountant frequently bartered accounting work in exchange for goods and services, (2) the husband purposely limited his accounting work during the marriage to spend more time with the children, (3) there was no evidence offered concerning comparable wages earned by similarly qualified individuals in the county or the region, and (4) tax records reflected that the husband’s primary income came from his gas wells. Polley v. Allen, 132 S.W.3d 223, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 83 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a trial court had the authority to impute income under KRS 403.212(2)(d), no findings were made that husband was voluntarily underemployed. Other than generally stating that the imputed income was derived from the law practice, rental properties and capital gains, the trial court provided no explanation as to how it reached the support figure; without adequate factual findings, as required by CR 52.01, the trial court decision could not be meaningfully reviewed. McKinney v. McKinney, 257 S.W.3d 130, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 187 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court should have granted a CR 52.02 motion for additional fact findings. Although the trial court was authorized to impute income under KRS 403.212(2)(d), a general statement that the imputation was derived from a part time law practice, rental properties and capital gains was not an explanation of how a child support figure was reached; fact findings were essential to the judgment, and the decision to impute income could not be meaningfully reviewed. McKinney v. McKinney, 257 S.W.3d 130, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 187 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 403.211(4) provides that the circumstances considered as extraordinary shall be determined by the court in its discretion and clearly the guidelines are not designed to cover all the possible scenarios in which divorcing parents find themselves; the legislature has not taken away the trial court’s broad discretion in ensuring that the needs of their children will continue to be met. Redmon v. Redmon, 823 S.W.2d 463, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 18 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where trial court sought to justify its decision by referring to the uncertain nature of father’s work, although that factor might properly have been taken into account in setting a schedule for payments (e.g. by having father make payments at one level when working and at another level when laid off, as was done by the trial court in a previous order), under the facts of this case, it was not an “extraordinary factor” justifying departure from the guidelines. Keplinger v. Keplinger, 839 S.W.2d 566, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 195 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> The Kentucky child support guidelines may be used by the parent, custodian, or agency substantially contributing to the support of the child as the basis for periodic updates of child support obligations and for modification of child support orders for health care. The provisions of any decree respecting child support may be modified only as to installments accruing subsequent to the filing of the motion for modification and only upon a showing of a material change in circumstances that is substantial and continuing.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Application of the Kentucky child support guidelines to the circumstances of the parties at the time of the filing of a motion or petition for modification of the child support order which results in equal to or greater than a fifteen percent (15%) change in the amount of support due per month shall be rebuttably presumed to be a material change in circumstances. Application which results in less than a fifteen percent (15%) change in the amount of support due per month shall be rebuttably presumed not to be a material change in circumstances. For the one (1) year period immediately following enactment of this statute, the presumption of material change shall be a twenty-five percent (25%) change in the amount of child support due rather than the fifteen percent (15%) stated above.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, provisions for the support of a child shall be terminated by emancipation of the child unless the child is a high school student when he reaches the age of eighteen (18). In cases where the child becomes emancipated because of age, but not due to marriage, while still a high school student, the court-ordered support shall continue while the child is a high school student, but not beyond completion of the school year during which the child reaches the age of nineteen (19) years. Provisions for the support of the child shall not be terminated by the death of a parent obligated to support the child. If a parent obligated to pay support dies, the amount of support may be modified, revoked, or commuted to a lump-sum payment, to the extent just and appropriate in the circumstances. Emancipation of the child shall not terminate the obligation of child support arrearages that accrued while the child was an unemancipated minor.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> The child support guidelines table shall be reviewed at least once every four (4) years by a commission consisting of the following persons:</p>

Clary v. Clary, 54 S.W.3d 568, 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 696 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jessamine Circuit Court erroneously granted the mother’s motion to compel discovery in the child support modification case, and the father was, therefore, granted a writ of prohibition under CR 76.36; before seeking discovery, the mother, under KRS 403.213(1), was required to make a showing of a material change of circumstances and to file a motion to modify child support, neither of which the mother had done.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not err in denying a mother’s motion to modify a father’s child support obligation because the mother failed to prove a material change in circumstances to justify an increase in the father’s support obligation under KRS 403.213. Although the mother claimed that she was forced to seek state assistance for the child’s medical needs, the family court found that the father had always provided insurance for the child and that the mother simply needed an updated insurance card; thus, the only evidence of any change in circumstances was readily refuted by the record.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Child support guidelines were inapplicable, KRS 403.211(3)(e) and (g), because the parties’ combined monthly gross income exceeded the uppermost level of the child support guidelines rendering application of the guidelines inappropriate, and the familial circumstances were of an extraordinary nature rendering application of the child support guidelines unjust; as the child support guidelines were inapplicable, the rebuttable presumption found in KRS 403.213(2) concerning modification of child support was inapplicable, and upon remand, the family court had to consider the father’s motions to modify child support in accordance with KRS 403.213(1). Dudgeon v. Dudgeon, 318 S.W.3d 106, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 136 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Husband made an insufficient demonstration of a change of circumstances after a divorce decree with the exception of filing for bankruptcy to warrant modification of child support; because other financial obligations were discharged, more of the husband’s income could presumably be applied to child support, and the husband’s ex-wife testified that the husband’s child support payments had become more regular since the bankruptcy discharge.

<p class="p6">The court from time to time after considering the financial resources of both parties may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this chapter and for attorney’s fees, including sums for legal services rendered and costs incurred prior to the commencement of the proceeding or after entry of judgment. The court may order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in his name.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The allocation of court costs and attorney’s fees are entirely within the discretion of the court. Wilhoit v. Wilhoit, 521 S.W.2d 512, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 156 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Allocation of court costs and award of attorney’s fees are entirely within the discretion of the trial court. Browning v. Browning, 551 S.W.2d 823, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 707 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial judge should determine if fees should be granted under his discretionary authority granted in this section, after he determines that fees are not mandatory under KRS 403.340(3). Dexter v. Spainhoward, 563 S.W.2d 474, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 478 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial judge labors under the misconception that he lacks authority to award attorneys’ fees, it cannot be said that he exercised his discretion. Adkins v. Adkins, 574 S.W.2d 898, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 631 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court has a broad latitude in determining whether to assess attorney fees in a dissolution of marriage and where the trial judge thoroughly considered the provisions of this section and the appropriate stan- dards for awarding such fees, it did not abuse its discretion in requiring each party to pay for his own attorney. Russell v. Russell, 605 S.W.2d 33, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 363 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3158, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1004, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 2764 (U.S. 1981).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The amount of an award of attorney’s fees is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court with good reason; that court is in the best position to observe conduct and tactics which waste the court’s and attorneys’ time and must be given wide latitude to sanction or discourage such conduct. Gentry v. Gentry, 798 S.W.2d 928, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The allocation of attorney’s fees is entirely within the discretion of the court and is not mandatory. In addition to $5,000.00 for attorney’s fees, the court awarded wife $3,500.00 for costs incurred in hiring expert witnesses. Furthermore, wife’s attorney’s fees totaling $17,000.00 were based on the cost of employing two attorneys. Considering this and the amount of property wife was awarded at trial, the Court of Appeals did not believe that the parties’ financial resources were such that the trial court abused its discretion. Underwood v. Underwood, 836 S.W.2d 439, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 164 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992), overruled in part, Neidlinger v. Neidlinger, 52 S.W.3d 513, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 141 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court’s refusal to order the husband to reimburse the wife for attorney’s fees she had paid did not abuse the trial court’s discretion, even where there was a financial disparity between the parties. Neidlinger v. Neidlinger, 52 S.W.3d 513, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 141 (Ky. 2001), overruled in part, Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an ex-wife instituted divorce proceedings, she was ineligible to receive extra compensation under an antenuptial agreement; however, despite the agreement, the trial court failed to use its discretion to consider the disparity in the parties’ financial resources in determining whether to award attorney’s fees and costs. Ford v. Blue, 106 S.W.3d 470, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 100 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was a vast discrepancy between the mother’s income and the father’s income, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 403.220 in awarding the mother $2,829 in attorney’s fees and costs in the child support modification proceeding that the mother instituted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finck v. Finck, 2005 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 908 (Ky. Ct. App. May 27, 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the wife clearly had greater financial resources than the husband, which definitively prevented her from receiving attorney’s fees, and it was clear that the trial court considered the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>conduct during the dissolution proceedings and the financial imbalance between them in ordering the wife to pay $30,000 of the husband’s attorney fees, there was no abuse of discretion. Smith v. Smith, 235 S.W.3d 1, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 36 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In divorce proceeding the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding allocation of liability for court costs to husband. Beaver v. Beaver, 551 S.W.2d 23, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 692 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In assessing costs, including attorneys’ fees, against husband in divorce action, the trial court found disparity in the financial resources of the parties, and under the statute, no more is required. Gentry v. Gentry, 798 S.W.2d 928, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 117 (Ky. 1990).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in awarding the wife attorney fees based on the fact that the husband had a hiring earning capacity. Lambe v. Weber, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 177 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2014 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1053 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In divorce action, allowance of an attorney’s fee is to be taxed as costs and is to be made pursuant to a motion for same. Such allowance in no way partakes of the qualities of a legal issue growing out of the clause of action, and mere fact that an attorney withdrew from case does not create such a legal issue. Buttermann v. Fox, 312 Ky. 652, 229 S.W.2d 160, 1950 Ky. LEXIS 715 (Ky. 1950) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Interest is allowable on an award of attorney’s fees in a divorce proceeding because such fees are part of the court costs. Sharp v. Sharp, 516 S.W.2d 875, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fees of out-of-state attorney for representing wife in divorce proceedings and taking out-of-state depositions were properly taxed as costs payable by husband. Sharp v. Sharp, 516 S.W.2d 875, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Allowance of $17,500 fee to wife’s attorney in divorce proceeding was not exorbitant and excessive since considering the extent of the litigation and the amount of property involved as reflected by the record, it appeared that adequate information was available to the chancellor to justify the allowance made. Sharp v. Sharp, 516 S.W.2d 875, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In connection with claim that attorney’s fee allowed wife’s attorney in divorce proceeding was excessive and exorbitant, action of trial court denying husband the opportunity to take deposition of the attorney for the purpose of ascertaining facts pertinent to the consideration of the amount of attorney’s fees to be allowed was improper, but where no prejudice resulted the award would not be disturbed. Sharp v. Sharp, 516 S.W.2d 875, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 185 (Ky. 1974).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where husband argued that since both parties have adequate financial resources it was a clear abuse of discretion to award an attorney’s fee to his former wife’s attorney against him, but husband did not name his former wife’s attorney a party to the appeal, such appeal must fail since the attorney must be made a party to the appeal whether the fee is adjudged to be paid directly to him or is allowed to one of the parties to the divorce in order to be included as a court-cost item. Beaver v. Beaver, 551 S.W.2d 23, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 692 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court assessed against a husband the attorney’s fees payable by the wife in a divorce action, it was error to attempt such an allowance without any evidence showing a need for it, since this section authorizes awards only when supported by an imbalance in the financial resources of the respective parties. Sullivan v. Levin, 555 S.W.2d 261, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 503 (Ky. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court’s authority to order payment of an attorney’s fee in a divorce action is strictly for the benefit of the client, not that of the attorney, and the power of the court to fix the fee payable by one of the parties to his own attorney is not conferred by this section so that the trial court exceeded its discretion in assessing attorney’s fees against both husband and wife at the request of the wife’s attorney. Sullivan v. Levin, 555 S.W.2d 261, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 503 (Ky. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the attorneys originally representing a wife in a divorce action were discharged by her prior to entry of judgment, the trial court had no authority to consider the amount of their fee or award a recovery for the attorneys against their own client. Oliver v. Yates, 555 S.W.2d 263, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 504 (Ky. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the sale or partitioning of real estate is merely incidental, and not primary, in an action for divorce, the court is precluded from awarding an attorney’s fee to be taxed as a part of the costs and paid out of the proceeds from the sale of the property as would occur in a partition suit pursuant to KRS 389A.030; rather, the remedy would be recovery from the husband pursuant to this section. Meredith v. Meredith, 619 S.W.2d 508, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 269 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the findings of the trial court or the record did not justify relief under the demanding standards of CR 60.02(f), there were sufficient findings to support the award of attorney’s fee pursuant to this section. Bishir v. Bishir, 698 S.W.2d 823, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 276 (Ky. 1985), overruled in part, Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it would have been better practice for affidavits or other evidence to be submitted in support of an award of attorney’s fees, there was no abuse of discretion in the court’s award of $1,500, given the extent of the record, the number of depositions taken, and numerous motions involved. Poe v. Poe, 711 S.W.2d 849, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1082 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court abused its discretion in ordering the husband to pay his former wife’s attorney fees of $2,500, in view of the court’s allowance of maintenance and equal division of the marital and nonmarital property, as well as the fact of the wife’s own employment. Drake v. Drake, 721 S.W.2d 728, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1480 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An allowance of attorney’s fees is authorized by this section only when it is supported by an imbalance in the financial resources of the respective parties. Lampton v. Lampton, 721 S.W.2d 736, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1496 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the resources of the parties were approximately equal, an award of attorney fees was an abuse of discretion. Lampton v. Lampton, 721 S.W.2d 736, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1496 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, which authorizes the court in certain divorce cases to order one party to pay a reasonable amount for attorney’s fees of the other party, is broad enough to authorize the payment of a fee to an attorney who has accepted representation of an indigent client under an express agreement that he would not charge his client any fee for his services. Hale v. Hale, 772 S.W.2d 628, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 62 (Ky. 1989), overruled in part, Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where husband earned only $4,550 more a year than wife, but that figure represented approximately 27% of what wife earned per year, there was a disparity in financial resources justifying an award of attorney fees to wife. Glidewell v. Glidewell, 859 S.W.2d 675, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 51 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The gross imbalance in the parties’ income, $45,000+ compared to $0, plus the wife’s lack of any income-producing property should have entitled her to an award of attorney fees pursuant to this section. Beckner v. Beckner, 903 S.W.2d 528, 1995 Ky. App. LEXIS 120 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory language is broad enough to authorize a trial court to require a party to advance prospective attorney’s fees necessary to enable the other party to obtain adequate representation. Neidlinger v. Neidlinger, 52 S.W.3d 513, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 141 (Ky. 2001), overruled in part, Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A wife’s attorney was not an indispensable party to her request that she be reimbursed by the husband for fees she had already paid the attorney, nor to her appeal of the trial court’s denial of her request. Neidlinger v. Neidlinger, 52 S.W.3d 513, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 141 (Ky. 2001), overruled in part, Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the family court made the findings required by KRS 403.200(1), (2) and 403.220, it properly awarded maintenance and attorney’s fees to the wife; as the husband had exclusive possession and use of the primary marital asset during the proceedings, retroactive judgment interest at 12 percent was proper under KRS 360.040. 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 182.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the record contained evidence that there was an imbalance in the financial resources of the husband and wife, which was in the husband’s favor, the trial court could justifiably award attorney fees to the wife. In particular, the husband continued to live “rent free” on a farm the husband had inherited before the marriage while the wife was leaving the marriage only with a small home that was fully encumbered. Jones v. Jones, 245 S.W.3d 815, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 24 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In light of the husband’s failure to seek a more specific finding from the trial court, and in light of the fact that a finding of disparity in the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>financial resources due to the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>respective incomes was supported by the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the wife 25% of her attorney fees and expert witness fees. Allison v. Allison, 246 S.W.3d 898, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 35 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though an issue relating to the reimbursement of attorney fees for an allegedly frivolous motion to set aside a divorce decree was not properly before an appellate court, the issue was still considered because the primary objective of appellate procedure was deciding cases on the merits, a cross-appellee made no objection himself, and no unfair prejudice resulted. At any rate, an argument that the trial court failed to make adequate findings of fact was rejected because a trial court judge exhaustively covered the division of marital assets post-judgment and was aware of the financial situation of the parties; it was not the province of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for the trial court’s decision with regard to attorney fee issues absent an abuse of discretion. Age v. Age, 340 S.W.3d 88, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 23 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a custody dispute between a father and maternal grandparents as part of a dissolution action in which the grandparents intervened, it was not necessary for the family court to conclude that the grandparents employed delay tactics to justify an award of attorney fees to the father. Rather, the only factor the family court was required to consider was the financial resources of the parties. The mere fact that litigation was lengthy and hotly contested, paired with consideration of the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>relative financial resources, was sufficient to permit an award of attorney fees under KRS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>403.220. Heltsley v. Frogge, 350 S.W.3d 807, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 100 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the father made approximately $450,000 while working in Abu Dhabi, and he would be making about $250,000 a year at his new job in Texas, while the mother was making approximately $46,000 a year at her job, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding some attorney fees to the mother due to the disparity of the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>incomes under KRS 403.220. McIntosh v. Landrum, 377 S.W.3d 574, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 160 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining a wife did not need any additional reimbursement for attorney’s fees because the wife used marital funds to pay her attorney, both parties’ total attorneys’ fees were roughly equal, and the wife already used marital assets to pay most of the fees she owed and had sufficient nonmarital assets to assist her in paying her fees. Normandin v. Normandin, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 176 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2018 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 960 (Ky. Ct. App. June 1, 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the trial court followed the dictates of the statute, it did not err in assessing attorney’s fees against a husband after considering the parties’ financial resources; the trial court was in the best position to observe the lack of candor and cooperation that led to the accrual of many of the fees in the case, which it noted in its order. Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court will no longer read a requirement into the statute that is not found within its plain language, and it overrules a line of cases insofar as they require a financial disparity in order for attorney’s fees to be awarded and return to the plain language of the statute; that language requires only that the trial court consider the financial resources of the parties before awarding attorney’s fees, not that a financial disparity exist. Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutory language is plain: after a trial court considers the parties’ financial resources, it may order one party to pay a reasonable amount of the other party’s attorney’s fees; the statute does not require that a financial disparity must exist in order for the trial court to do so, rather, that language is a creature of case law born out of the supreme court’s decisions. Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While financial disparity is no longer a threshold requirement which must be met in order for a trial court to award attorney’s fees, the financial disparity is still a viable factor for trial courts to consider in following the statute and looking at the parties’ total financial picture. Smith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 360 (Ky. 2018).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alleged father was incorrect in asserting that he had standing pursuant to KRS 430.270 to file a petition in the Family Court seeking custody and support regarding a child that was born to a wife of another. KRS 430.270 did not govern whether a court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine custody of children in cases such as the alleged father’s case that did not involve a dissolution of marriage. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 2008), overruled in part, J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a court is making its final and appealable custody decree, it must do so based on the best interests standard under KRS 403.270. Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the choice of custodian is between non-parents, Kentucky courts seek the result that is in the best interests of the child. Kentucky courts have not expressed a preference for relatives in non-parent custody cases; therefore, a grandparent does not have an automatic advantage over another blood relative. Miller v. Harris, 320 S.W.3d 138, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 152 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 403.270 and 403.320 address separate stages of a custody dispute: the initial custody determination and modification of visitation or timesharing. For each of these stages, a different standard is established. Under § 403.270, an initial determination of custody requires consideration of the best interests of the child, with a rebuttable presumption that joint custody and equal parenting time is in the child’s best interests. A modification of visitation or timesharing, governed by § 403.320, on the other hand, requires that the change be in the best interests of the child, unless the modification is less than reasonable, in which case the physical, mental, moral, or emotional health of the child must be seriously endangered. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky courts distinguish between an initial custody determination, which is governed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.270, and a modification of that decree, either under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 403.320 or 403.340. For example, when a final custody decree has been entered and a relocation motion arises, any post-decree determination made by the court is a modification, either of custody or timesharing/visitation. If a change in custody is sought, § 403.340 governs. If it is only timesharing/visitation for which modification is sought, then § 403.320 either applies directly or may be construed to do so. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Modification of visitation or timesharing is governed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.320, rather than the standard for an initial custody determination as set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.270. Accordingly, the recently added presumption of joint custody and equal parenting time in § 403.270 applies to custody determinations, but it does not apply to modifications of visitation or timesharing. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in reversing a family court’s finding that a minor child’s maternal grandfather and his girlfriend were de facto custodians of the child because they were not precluded from being the child’s de facto custodians simply because they were an unmarried couple where the child had been living with them since she was eight months old, the statutory language did not limit a minor’s de facto custodian to one person, and use of “de facto custodians” in the plural did not represent a departure where the statute expressly allowed the court to deviate from the legislative definition of “de facto custodian” if the context required otherwise. Krieger v. Garvin, 584 S.W.3d 727, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 377 (Ky. 2019).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred in finding that a maternal grandfather and his girlfriend qualified as de facto custodians of the subject child and awarding them permanent sole custody of her because the statutorily required period of the child’s residency with them, and dependency solely on the grandfather and his girlfriend for support, was not satisfied where there was never a continuous, untolled period of six months in which the child resided with the grandfather and his girlfriend that was not tolled by the mother’s efforts to regain custody, and he periods between the denials of the mother’s motions for custody and her renewals of those motions could not be aggregated to satisfy the six-month requirement. Garvin v. Krieger, 601 S.W.3d 481, 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 32 (Ky. Ct. App. 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The test for determining custody of an infant child is the “best interest” of the child, and not the most suitable person to have custody. Casale v. Casale, 549 S.W.2d 805, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 411 (Ky. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agreement between parents as to which of them should have custody of minor child is not binding on the court which is at all times primarily concerned with the welfare of the child and thereafter concerned for the parents. Atwood v. Atwood, 550 S.W.2d 465, 1976 Ky. LEXIS 153 (Ky. 1976).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In every custody proceeding the mental and physical health of all of the parties and whether the child is in an environment likely to endanger his physical, mental, moral or emotional health is of major importance. Atwood v. Atwood, 550 S.W.2d 465, 1976 Ky. LEXIS 153 (Ky. 1976).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether to issue an injunction against a mother’s seeking to change the name of her children from that of their natural father the court should use the “best interest” test of subsection (1) (now subsection (2)) of this section. Burke v. Hammonds, 586 S.W.2d 307, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 461 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only after a full hearing, at which all interested parties are given an opportunity to be heard, can the court determine if the mother’s proposed name change of her child is or is not in the best interest of the child; such a hearing is mandated by the requirements of due process. Burke v. Hammonds, 586 S.W.2d 307, 1979 Ky. App. LEXIS 461 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In child custody cases where the trial court conducts a nonjury trial pursuant to CR 52.01, the court must first consider all relevant factors, including those specifically enumerated under subsection (1) (now subsection (2)) of this section and then, as the ultimate or conclusory fact, determine the “best interests of the child”; it is mandatory that the facts be “specifically” found pursuant to CR 52.01. Stafford v. Stafford, 618 S.W.2d 578, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 256 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “best interests of the child” standard applies in determining custody of children born out of wedlock; gone is the preference for the mother of the illegitimate child.

Mennemeyer v. Mennemeyer, 887 S.W.2d 555, 1994 Ky. App. LEXIS 138 (Ky. Ct. App. 1994), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scheer v. Zeigler, 21 S.W.3d 807, 2000 Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application of equitable estoppel to paternity matters is in accord with the best interest test of KRS 403.270 applying to custody cases; it is in the best interest of children to prohibit fathers, who have previously represented that they were the children’s fathers, to disclaim fatherhood in order to avoid paying child support. S.R.D. v. T.L.B., 174 S.W.3d 502, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 220 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in finding four months to be an unreasonable time for the mother to move to set aside a custody order, CR 60.02, as there was no absolute cutoff for filing a motion, and the trial court erred in awarding custody to the father without receiving evidence in support of its decision, KRS 403.270(2). Kerr v. Osborne, 305 S.W.3d 455, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 52 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Paternal grandparents were properly awarded permanent custody of their grandson where a family court analyzed the factors under KRS 403.270, 620.023 and determined that the award was in the child’s best interest because the grandparents provided the grandson with a stable and secure environment and had worked with the school and counselors to ensure he was receiving proper treatment; a mother had not sought return of the child since 2003, she failed to stop abuse she was aware of, she failed to obtain a court-ordered evaluation, she failed to seek counseling, and she threatened another child in her care. L.D. v. J.H., 350 S.W.3d 828, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 258 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred in awarding custody of the mother’s children to their respective fathers because the family court failed to sufficiently consider and make findings related to the factors set forth in KRS 403.270(2). While the family court checked several boxes in its original form orders granting custody to the fathers addressing those factors, the family court did not include any additional findings upon which those rulings were based. N.L. v. W.F., 368 S.W.3d 136, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 80 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based on the history of the relationship of the parties, the fact that neither had an income and both parties relied on the charity and good will of other people to survive, their support systems, and their lack of ties to the county, under KRS 403.270, the child’s best interest would be served by allowing her to be relocated to Washington with her mother. Samson v. Samson, 377 S.W.3d 571, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 143 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court properly found it was in the child’s best interest to name the father as the residential parent because the mother tended to reject any challenge to the diagnosis of gender identity disorder for the child, dismissing medical opinions, and the record also reflected the mother’s history of seeking out diagnoses for the child from before she was even a year old. The court’s findings related both to the mother’s behavior, including her actions in dressing the child in boy clothing and giving her a boy haircut prior to visiting the first provider to diagnose her. Williams v. Frymire, 377 S.W.3d 579, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 161 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if the appellate court were to assume that appellee had unequivocally decided to relocate to Kansas (rather than Missouri) with the parties' minor children, the exhibits referenced by the family court were too generalized to support a finding that moving to Kansas would be in the best interest of these children, who had very special needs. There was no testimony that utilization of the services in Kansas would actually be more beneficial to the children. Agnich v. Tyler, 520 S.W.3d 394, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 119 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court failed to adequately address whether the parties' minor children's best interests would actually be served by relocating with appellee to another state.

App. LEXIS 119 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court fully considered all relevant evidence and the split custody determination was not an abuse of its discretion; the mother did not point to evidence casting doubt on the split custody arrangement, and while both parties had significant personal issues at the time of the filing of the divorce, they seemed to have resolved most of those issues when the final order was entered. Keith v. Keith, 556 S.W.3d 10, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 204 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> A party to a custody proceeding may move for a temporary custody order. The motion must be supported by an affidavit as provided in KRS 403.350. The court may award temporary custody under the standards of KRS 403.270 after a hearing, or, if there is no objection, solely on the basis of the affidavits. If the parents or a de facto custodian joined under subsection (9) of this section present a temporary custody agreement and mutually agreed plan for parenting time, and the court confirms that the agreement adequately provides for the welfare of the child, the agreement shall become the temporary custody order of the court.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Subject to KRS 403.315, in making an order for temporary custody, there shall be a presumption, rebuttable by preponderance of evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child for the parents or a de facto custodian joined under subsection (9) of this section to have temporary joint custody and share equally in parenting time.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> If a deviation from equal parenting time is warranted, the court shall construct a parenting time schedule which maximizes the time each parent or de facto custodian joined under subsection (9) of this section has with the child and is consistent with ensuring the child’s welfare.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> Each temporary custody order shall include specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, except when the court confirms the agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> Any temporary custody order shall address the circumstance in which physical possession of the child will be exchanged.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> Subject to KRS 403.320(4) and 403.340(5), modification of a temporary custody order may be sought when there is a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parents, de facto custodian, or child.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> If a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is dismissed, any temporary custody order is vacated unless a parent or the child’s custodian moves that the proceeding continue as a custody proceeding and the court finds, after a hearing, that the circumstances of the parents and the best interests of the child require that a custody decree be issued.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> If a custody proceeding commenced in the absence of a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation under KRS 403.822(1)(a) or (b) is dismissed, any temporary custody order is vacated.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> If a court determines by clear and convincing evidence that a person is a de facto custodian, the court shall join that person in the action, as a party needed for just adjudication under Rule 19 of the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a nonparent alleges an in loco parentis relationship has been established in a jurisdictionally viable custody action, the court should hold a hearing to determine whether the granting of visitation privileges to the nonparent would be in the best interest of the child.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Basis of Order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The visitation rights ordered by the trial court were not clearly erroneous and unreasonable, even though it was evident that the basis for such an order was the fact that the husband was living with a woman to whom he was not married. Richie v. Richie, 596 S.W.2d 32, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 403.270 and 403.320 address separate stages of a custody dispute: the initial custody determination and modification of visitation or timesharing. For each of these stages, a different standard is established. Under § 403.270, an initial determination of custody requires consideration of the best interests of the child, with a rebuttable presumption that joint custody and equal parenting time is in the child’s best interests. A modification of visitation or timesharing, governed by § 403.320, on the other hand, requires that the change be in the best interests of the child, unless the modification is less than reasonable, in which case the physical, mental, moral, or emotional health of the child must be seriously endangered. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky courts distinguish between an initial custody determination, which is governed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.270, and a modification of that decree, either under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 403.320 or 403.340. For example, when a final custody decree has been entered and a relocation motion arises, any post-decree determination made by the court is a modification, either of custody or timesharing/visitation. If a change in custody is sought, § 403.340 governs. If it is only timesharing/visitation for which modification is sought, then § 403.320 either applies directly or may be construed to do so. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Modification of visitation or timesharing is governed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.320, rather than the standard for an initial custody determination as set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.270. Accordingly, the recently added presumption of joint custody and equal parenting time in § 403.270 applies to custody determinations, but it does not apply to modifications of visitation or timesharing. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 403.320(3), the family court can modify the timesharing arrangement if it first finds that the modification was in the best interests of the children, or it could restrict timesharing (i.e., order a less than reasonable timesharing) if it first finds that the children’s physical, mental, moral or emotional health was seriously endangered. Layman v. Bohanon, 599 S.W.3d 423, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 71 (Ky. 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (1) of this section, the noncustodial parent has absolute entitlement to visitation unless there is a finding of serious endangerment of the child. No “best interests” standard is to be applied; denial of visitation is permitted only if the child is seriously endangered. Hornback v. Hornback, 636 S.W.2d 24, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 224 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Noncustodial parent’s status as an inmate in a penal institution alone did not make visitation with his child inappropriate where there was no finding that the child would be endangered in any manner by visiting her father in prison.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in amending a domestic violence order (DVO) to include the couple’s minor child because the trial court erred in precluding appellant from presenting a witness who would testify that she changed the minor child after appellant returned him and before the mother returned and that she did not observe any burns or other injuries to the child; the trial court should have considered that evidence before concluding that appellant committed an act of domestic violence against his child. Abdur-Rahman v. Peterson, 338 S.W.3d 823, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 79 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court abused its discretion by restricting a parent's visitation rights with the parent's teenage child because the evidence was insufficient to establish that the child's welfare was endangered, in that, while a hair follicle of the parent tested positive for low level marijuana use twelve to fourteen months preceding the test, there was no evidence that the parent was using illegal drugs in front of the child. Ryan v. Ryan, 473 S.W.3d 637, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 141 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).</p>

Oster, 444 S.W.3d 460, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 128 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the original decree dissolving her marriage temporarily excluded the natural mother from having any visitation with her children until she was certified to be mentally and emotionally stable at which time she could request that the court permit supervised visitation, and the mother did not appeal that judgment, a subsequent court order, which summarily modified the previous judgment in order to allow the mother to have visitation with her children, was improper in that since the previous order was unappealed, the court was bound to follow it as the law between the parties and not to consider a modification of visitation without a certification that the mother was mentally and emotionally stable. Hornback v. Hornback, 636 S.W.2d 24, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 224 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a decree granting or denying visitation may be modified, a trial court’s original finding that visitation was not in the best interest of the children at issue does not bar a later modification of that ruling. McNeeley v. McNeeley, 45 S.W.3d 876, 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 64 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Change in the primary residential custodian amounted to a modification of the joint custody arrangement (not visitation) because, under the new arrangement, the mother assumed the primary role in the minor day-to-day decisions concerning the children, was primarily responsible for providing a residence for the children, and assumed their normal routine care and control, and the Circuit Court’s order noted that the “parenting time” was “reversed” as was the child support obligation. Because it was a modification of custody, the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion since it was not supported by at least two (2) affidavits, as required by KRS 403.340(2). Crossfield v. Crossfield, 155 S.W.3d 743, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 4 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a decree permitted review only of the parents’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“time-sharing arrangement,” not of the joint custody award, when the mother moved more than 150 miles from the county where the decree was entered, the trial court reversibly erred by modifying custody. Robinson v. Robinson, 211 S.W.3d 63, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 354 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Practice of renaming visitation “shared time,” “time-sharing,” “parenting time,” or any other similar term, even as to joint custodians, will not affect the inherent nature of visitation nor the applicability of KRS 403.320 to modify it. Robinson v. Robinson, 211 S.W.3d 63, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 354 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a final custody decree has been entered and a relocation motion arises, any post-decree determination made by a court is a modification, either of custody or timesharing/visitation. If a change in custody is sought, KRS 403.340 governs, but if it is only timesharing/visitation for which modification is sought, then KRS 403.320 either applies directly or may be construed to do so. Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Visitation or time-sharing may be modified pursuant to KRS 403.320, and custody may be modified pursuant to KRS 403.340; the distinction between a visitation/time-sharing motion and a custody motion has been explained by the Kentucky Supreme Court in Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008). The obvious problem is that parties often ask for one thing when they are actually seeking the other, due to the unique nature of their shared (joint) custody or split (sole) custody, and courts have struggled ever since the concept of joint custody emerged with what part physical or residential possession of the child plays in each type of custody; the first question on a custody modification is whether the motion actually seeks modification of custody or visitation/timesharing. Kelsay v. Carson, 317 S.W.3d 595, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 124 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order modifying custody and visitation was properly reversed because, although adequate findings were made by the trial court from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge’s duty was not satisfied until the findings were reduced to writing; the father’s argument that the trial court was not obligated to make written findings of fact when it ruled upon the mother’s motion was rejected. Keifer v. Keifer, 354 S.W.3d 123, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 149 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 403.320, an order modifying parenting time in favor of the father was appropriate as the mother’s school and work schedules inhibited her ability to spend sufficient time with the children, while the father participated in school activities, met with teachers, transported the children to and from games, and helped them with homework. Burton v. Burton, 355 S.W.3d 489, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 231 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Simply because the father might be working during part of the time the children were in his custody did not justify replacing him as the primary residential custodian; thus, under KRS 403.270(2), 403.320(3), the trial court did not err in denying the mother’s motion to alter, amend or vacate the order designating the father as the primary residential custodian. Rice v. Rice, 372 S.W.3d 449, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 111 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court properly found it was in the child’s best interest to modify custody to the father because the mother tended to reject any challenge to the diagnosis of gender identity disorder for the child, dismissing medical opinions, and the record also reflected the mother’s history of seeking out diagnoses for the child from before she was even a year old. The court’s findings related both to the mother’s behavior, including her actions in dressing the child in boy clothing and giving her a boy haircut prior to visiting the first provider to diagnose her. Williams v. Frymire, 377 S.W.3d 579, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 161 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court's decision to modify the parties' visitation and timesharing with their children and to have the children primarily reside in the area with one parent and to prohibit the other parent from relocating to Mississippi with the parties' two minor children was not an abuse of the court's discretion because the court conducted a thorough analysis of the evidence presented, applied the requisite statutory factors, and reached a conclusion supported by the evidence. A. G. v. T. B., 452 S.W.3d 141, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 162 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not clearly err in declining to release the children's therapy records in the context of a father's motion to modify visitation where case law did not create an automatic waiver of the children's psychiatrist-patient privilege, none of the exceptions to the privilege applied, and the family court had followed the procedure established by the parties for reviewing the children's records. Williams v. Williams, 526 S.W.3d 108, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 393 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reduction in a father’s timesharing was not an abuse of discretion because the reduction did not cause the father to have less than reasonable visitation, so the father’s time was not “restricted” as used in the relevant statute. French v. French, 581 S.W.3d 45, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 117 (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (2) of this section, a “best interests” of the child standard is required when a judgment is sought to be modified.

Hornback v. Hornback, 636 S.W.2d 24, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 224 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although trial court’s order reducing father’s visitation privileges with his child did not “restrict” his visitation rights as that term is contemplated under subsection (3) of this section, the court’s modification was made without the requisite finding that the child’s best interest would be served by such a modification and was inappropriately used as punishment for his “piggy-backing” vacation time onto his regular weekend visitation; as a result, the trial court’s order was reversed and father’s original visitation restored. Kulas v. Kulas, 898 S.W.2d 529, 1995 Ky. App. LEXIS 97 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence supported a conclusion that placing the child with her mother was in the child’s best interests under KRS 403.320 because the father failed to supply the family court with assurances that his alcohol issues would not arise again after he had undergone repeated relapses in the last 18 months.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In every proceeding for the modification of a custody decree the mental and physical health of all the parties and whether the child is in an environment likely to endanger his physical, mental, moral or emotional health is of major importance. Atwood v. Atwood, 550 S.W.2d 465, 1976 Ky. LEXIS 153 (Ky. 1976).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The original award of care, custody and control of minors is subject to the control of the court and may be modified pursuant to this section upon a showing of a change of circumstances. Cherry v. Cherry, 634 S.W.2d 423, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 263 (Ky. 1982).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where father made a motion for modification of joint physical custody under this section prompted by mother’s decision to relocate with the child to another state, and where father failed to allege that there was an inability or bad faith refusal of the parties to cooperate, the best interests of the child controlled and court intervention must be based on factors enumerated in KRS 403.270.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Orders entered pursuant to KRS 403.280, such as pendente lite, interlocutory, or non-final orders, are temporary custody orders; the final decision about custody is the custody decree, and while it is immediately appealable, it is subject to modification at a later time under KRS 403.340. The decree is the one that is final or appealable, meaning that it is a final order under CR 54.01 adjudicating all the rights of all the parties in an action or proceeding, or a judgment made final under CR 54.02. Frances v. Frances, 266 S.W.3d 754, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 258 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Legislative Intent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both subsection (1) and (2) of this section require a situation that may “seriously endanger” the child, and both quite obviously express the legislative intent to stabilize the child’s condition and inhibit further litigation over his custody unless the child is in serious danger. Quisenberry v. Quisenberry, 785 S.W.2d 485, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Visitation or time-sharing may be modified pursuant to KRS 403.320, and custody may be modified pursuant to KRS 403.340; the distinction between a visitation/time-sharing motion and a custody motion has been explained by the Kentucky Supreme Court in Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008). The obvious problem is that parties often ask for one thing when they are actually seeking the other, due to the unique nature of their shared (joint) custody or split (sole) custody, and courts have struggled ever since the concept of joint custody emerged with what part physical or residential possession of the child plays in each type of custody; the first question on a custody modification is whether the motion actually seeks modification of custody or visitation/timesharing. Kelsay v. Carson, 317 S.W.3d 595, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 124 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When joint custody is awarded under subsection (3) (now subsection (5)) of KRS 403.270 and the parties subsequently disagree, neither this section nor KRS 403.350 applies, as these sections are applicable to modification of a sole custody award; instead, modification should be made anew under KRS 403.270 as if there had been no prior custody determination. Benassi v. Havens, 710 S.W.2d 867, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1081 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scheer v. Zeigler, 21 S.W.3d 807, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and KRS 403.350 are applicable only to a modification of a sole custody award. Erdman v. Clements, 780 S.W.2d 635, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 149 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there has been an award of joint custody under KRS 403.270, but parents are unable to cooperate, a hearing de novo should be held to determine custody as if no prior custody determination had been made. Erdman v. Clements, 780 S.W.2d 635, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 149 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 403.350 is not a substitute for subsection (2) (now subsection (3)) of this section, but is simply a procedural device establishing the method for bringing a motion for modification before the court. The existence of this procedure does not provide a vehicle to discard subdivision (2)(c) (now subsection (3)(c)) of this section and utilize the best interest rule as the sole standard for deciding a change of custody issue. Quisenberry v. Quisenberry, 785 S.W.2d 485, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The differences between subsections (1) and (2) (now (2) and (3)) of this section are procedural, and arise to accommodate circumstances inherent in the passage of time. Quisenberry v. Quisenberry, 785 S.W.2d 485, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not apply where a party moved to set aside a previous custody decree, rather than to modify it. Dull v. George, 982 S.W.2d 227, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 116 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Joint custody is an award of custody which is subject to the custody modification statutes set forth in this section and KRS 403.350, and there is no threshold requirement for modifying joint custody other than such requirements as may be imposed by the statutes. Scheer v. Zeigler, 21 S.W.3d 807, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After the enactment of KRS 403.340, a custodial parent’s decision to relocate with the parties’ children was presumptively permissible, and a custodial parent could relocate with the children without prior approval or modification of a joint custody award. After receiving notice from the residential custodian of his or her intent to relocate with the parties’ child, the burden was then upon any party objecting to file a custody modification motion within a reasonable time and after that, to satisfy the modification standard of KRS 403.340 in order to change the designation of primary residential custodian, and if no motion was filed within a reasonable time, the primary residential custodian could relocate with the parties’ child. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a relocation of the children of the parties to a divorce would, as a practical matter, impact a non-primary residential custodian’s ability to share physical custody of the children, the relocation did not extinguish the non-primary residential custodial parent’s rights with regard to shared physical custody, nor did the relocation affect the essential nature of the joint custody — i.e., the parents’ shared decision-making authority, so a non-primary residential custodian parent who objected to the relocation could only prevent the relocation by being named the sole or primary residential custodian, and to accomplish this re-designation required a modification of the prior custody award, and he or she had to therefore show that the child’s present environment endangered seriously his physical, mental, moral, or emotional health, and the harm likely to be caused by a change of environment was outweighed by its advantages. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a mother who had been designated as primary residential custodian in the parties’ joint custody arrangement wanted to relocate to pursue better educational opportunities out of state, and the father objected to the relocation, the father had to show that the proposed relocation seriously endangered the children’s physical, mental, moral, or emotional health, and that the harm likely to be caused by a change of their custody to the father would be outweighed by its advantages, and a prior order precluding the mother from relocating with the children without the father’s consent or a court order inappropriately placed the burden on the mother to justify the relocation despite the evidentiary burdens the father had to meet to prevent the relocation under KRS 403.340. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the General Assembly amended KRS 403.270 to authorize joint custody, the statutes that governed the modification of custody were already on the books, and, because the General Assembly took no steps to enact additional statutes governing modification of joint custody awards, the Legislature must have intended those prior provisions to apply equally to joint custody, and the General Assembly amended KRS 403.340 to expressly encompass joint custody modifications, KRS 403.340(1), and this subsequent enactment further supported the conclusion that joint custody modification was to be governed by the custody modification statutes. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Joint custody modification fell exclusively within the purview of KRS 403.340 and 403.350, and previous judicially-created “gateways” to joint custody modification were inapplicable, so joint custody was not subject to modification at the mere whim of a party or simply because the parties disagreed as to a child-rearing decision, nor was the lack of cooperation by one or both parties grounds for modification of joint custody unless it rose to the statutory level required for modification of custody under KRS 403.340. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a permanency order in a dependency action brought under Chapter 620 complies with KRS 403.270(2) and is based on the best interests of the child, it would qualify as a “custody decree” and the requirements of KRS 403.340 would have to be satisfied in order to amend it. Since the permanency order in question in this case was not a “custody decree” within the meaning of KRS Chapter 403, KRS 403.340 is inapplicable, and the Family Court was required to consider the petition for custody as if there had been no prior custody determination. London v. Collins, 242 S.W.3d 351, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 462 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial court’s order modifying child custody was proper because, pursuant to KRS 403.340, the “serious endangerment” standard was not the only standard for modifications occurring more than two years after rendition of the order sought to be modified, and the trial court explicitly applied the KRS 403.340 standards to the case; the trial court’s decision was not unreasonable or unfair, and the decision was not clearly erroneous and applied the proper law. Coffman v. Rankin, 260 S.W.3d 767, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a final custody decree has been entered and a relocation motion arises, any post-decree determination made by a court is a modification, either of custody or timesharing/visitation. If a change in custody is sought, KRS 403.340 governs, but if it is only timesharing/visitation for which modification is sought, then KRS 403.320 either applies directly or may be construed to do so. Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the stepfather’s de facto custodian status was the basis for the trial court’s award of joint custody, the stepfather’s standing to participate in the custody proceedings was derived from his status as a joint custodian, and there was no requirement under Kentucky law that a non-parent who was granted custodial rights due to his or her designation as a de facto custodian had to maintain the de facto custodian status in order to maintain standing as a joint custodian; the adoptive parents failed to present any evidence to suggest that the stepfather’s status as joint custodian was not in the child’s best interest, as required by KRS 403.340. Williams v. Bittel, 299 S.W.3d 284, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 241 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mother in a child custody modification case incorrectly claimed that the trial court failed to follow KRS 403.340(3) about finding that a change in circumstances had occurred, as the record showed that the trial court had made such findings. The trial court found that since the original custody order was entered in favor of the mother, the father had obtained increased visitation, that the younger daughter missed seeing an older daughter who had obtained the age of majority, and that the relationship between the mother and younger daughter had deteriorated, which not only showed changed circumstances existed, but supported a finding that the best interests of the youngest daughter, considering application of the relevant factors under KRS 403.340(3)(c), dictated that custody be changed from the mother to the father. Morgan v. Getter, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 43 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2013 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 517 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2013).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where mother sought relief from order awarding the father care, custody and control of infant son pursuant to CR 60.02 and no motion was ever made for such relief during the trial, mother was not entitled for such relief on her motion to redocket and motion to modify previous custody order. Crosier v. Hunt, 522 S.W.2d 453, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 137 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where record disclosed no semblance of compliance with this section which sets forth the only way in which a custody decree may be modified within two years after its date, and where there was no motion by either party that the original judgment be modified, order of trial court refusing to enforce it was erroneous. Chandler v. Chandler, 535 S.W.2d 71, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in dismissing a father’s motion to modify child custody without holding an evidentiary hearing; the trial court applied a version of the modification statute, KRS 403.340, and the new version required that the trial court consider and to permit a change of custody based on the factors enumerated in KRS 403.270(2), the statute used in making initial custody decisions, and thus the trial court applied an incorrect standard in dismissing the motion. Fowler v. Sowers, 151 S.W.3d 357, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 331 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Change in the primary residential custodian amounted to a modification of the joint custody arrangement (not visitation) because, under the new arrangement, the mother assumed the primary role in the minor day-to-day decisions concerning the children, was primarily responsible for providing a residence for the children, and assumed their normal routine care and control, and the Circuit Court’s order noted that the “parenting time” was “reversed” as was the child support obligation. Because it was a modification of custody, the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion since it was not supported by at least two (2) affidavits, as required by KRS 403.340(2). Crossfield v. Crossfield, 155 S.W.3d 743, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 4 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intent was for their child to return to the mother under their agreed order, the father was required to move for modification if he wanted a change; as the father did not move for modification of custody or file an affidavit as required by KRS 403.340 and 403.350, a trial court had no jurisdiction and improperly modified the custodial arrangement on its own motion. Crouch v. Crouch, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 191 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 2, 2005), aff'd, 201 S.W.3d 463, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 227 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error for the lower court to deny the wife’s request for a hearing on her request to modify the custody agreement because the agreement was less than two years old, the wife was not designated as the primary custodial parent but both parents had joint custody, and the wife had not established that the child was seriously endangered under the current custody arrangement. Brockman v. Craig, 205 S.W.3d 244, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006), overruled in part, Shafizadeh v. Bowles, 366 S.W.3d 373, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 127 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a father’s pursuit of custody modification occurred within two (2) years of the custody award, he had to file a motion under KRS 403.340(2) and file affidavits showing grounds for modification pursuant to KRS 403.350. Since he failed to do so, the trial court had no authority to modify custody, and the mother should have been permitted to relocate with the children. Robinson v. Robinson, 211 S.W.3d 63, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 354 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a motion to modify a child custody determination was obtained by filing a proper motion and affidavit.

Rankin, 260 S.W.3d 767, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no procedural vehicle to challenge a trial court’s determination that adequate cause for a hearing on a motion to modify custody was shown; such a determination was similar to an order overruling a motion for summary judgment, and any challenge was required to await the trial court’s final order.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When joint custody is awarded under subsection (3) of KRS 403.270 and the parties subsequently disagree, neither KRS 403.340 nor this section applies, as these sections are applicable to modification of a sole custody award; instead, modification should be made anew under KRS 403.270 as if there had been no prior custody determination. Benassi v. Havens, 710 S.W.2d 867, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1081 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scheer v. Zeigler, 21 S.W.3d 807, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and KRS 403.340 are applicable only to a modification of a sole custody award. Erdman v. Clements, 780 S.W.2d 635, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 149 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there has been an award of joint custody under KRS 403.270, but parents are unable to cooperate, a hearing de novo should be held to determine custody as if no prior custody determination had been made. Erdman v. Clements, 780 S.W.2d 635, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 149 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not a substitute for KRS 403.340(2) (now (3)), but is simply a procedural device establishing the method for bringing a motion for modification before the court. The existence of this procedure does not provide a vehicle to discard KRS 403.340(2)(c) (now (3)(c)) and utilize the best interest rule as the sole standard for deciding a change of custody issue. Quisenberry v. Quisenberry, 785 S.W.2d 485, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Joint custody is an award of custody which is subject to the custody modification statutes set forth in KRS 403.340 and this section, and there is no threshold requirement for modifying joint custody other than such requirements as may be imposed by the statutes. Scheer v. Zeigler, 21 S.W.3d 807, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 68 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Joint custody modification fell exclusively within the purview of KRS 403.340 and 403.350, and previous judicially-created “gateways” to joint custody modification were inapplicable, so joint custody was not subject to modification at the mere whim of a party or simply because the parties disagreed as to a child-rearing decision, nor was the lack of cooperation by one or both parties grounds for modification of joint custody unless it rose to the statutory level required for modification of custody under KRS 403.340. Fenwick v. Fenwick, 114 S.W.3d 767, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 2003), overruled in part, Pennington v. Marcum, 266 S.W.3d 759, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 235 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an agreed order to transfer custody of a child to the father was meant to be temporary and not a modification of the permanent custody order making the mother the primary custodian, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the permanent order and grant the father physical custody, as he did not file a motion to modify, along with a supporting affidavit, as required by KRS 403.350. Crouch v. Crouch, 201 S.W.3d 463, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 227 (Ky. 2006).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of KRS 403.340 and this section is to maximize the finality of a custody decree without jeopardizing the health and welfare of the child; moreover, KRS 403.340 creates a presumption that the present custodian is entitled to continue as the child’s custodian. West v. West, 664 S.W.2d 948, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 468 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires a party seeking a change in custody to submit an affidavit with his motion setting forth facts supporting the requested change; such facts must establish adequate cause for a hearing. Lacking such facts, the court is required to deny the motion without a hearing. West v. West, 664 S.W.2d 948, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 468 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given the trial court’s reluctance to change custody, the movant must present facts in his affidavit that compel the court’s attention; he cannot simply assert the statutory requirements for modification of the court’s custody decree. West v. West, 664 S.W.2d 948, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 468 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the affidavits submitted to change temporary custody contained no facts upon which the court could find cause for a hearing, but instead were vague and conclusory, it was an abuse of discretion for the court to entertain the father’s motion. Gladish v. Gladish, 741 S.W.2d 658, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 512 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only affidavits may be considered in determining adequate cause for a hearing on modification of custody. Betzer v. Betzer, 749 S.W.2d 694, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere allegations are not sufficient to establish adequate cause for a hearing on modification of custody. Betzer v. Betzer, 749 S.W.2d 694, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the father alleged in his affidavit that the two boys spent most of the time either at day care or with their maternal grandparents and spent very little time with the mother, that the maternal grandparents had a drinking problem, that the children participated in very few activities while with their mother, and that the youngest child had told him that his mother had struck him causing a black eye, the affidavit failed to indicate that the children’s physical, mental, emotional or moral health was endangered by their living conditions with the mother where the father offered no grounds for his accusation, he did not specify what activities the children were being deprived of, and the mother asserted that a police investigation of the child’s allegation produced no factual information to support it; therefore, no facts were established which would show that adequate cause for a hearing existed. Betzer v. Betzer, 749 S.W.2d 694, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 41 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that a mother’s relocation to Tennessee might affect the frequency of the father’s time-sharing with his children and the children’s contact with other persons was insufficient to support a finding that the proposed relocation created a likelihood of serious harm to the children.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where no affidavits or other documentary evidence were filed by father seeking to change children’s custody from mother to himself by a motion made less than a year after the final custody order, the court had no basis on which to find that adequate cause for a hearing had been established and thus the court was required to deny father’s motion to modify custody decree. Robbins v. King, 519 S.W.2d 839, 1975 Ky. LEXIS 184 (Ky. 1975).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Change in the primary residential custodian amounted to a modification of the joint custody arrangement (not visitation) because, under the new arrangement, the mother assumed the primary role in the minor day-to-day decisions concerning the children, was primarily responsible for providing a residence for the children, and assumed their normal routine care and control, and the Circuit Court’s order noted that the “parenting time” was “reversed” as was the child support obligation. Because it was a modification of custody, the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion since it was not supported by at least two (2) affidavits, as required by KRS 403.340(2). Crossfield v. Crossfield, 155 S.W.3d 743, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 4 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intent was for their child to return to the mother under their agreed order, the father was required to move for modification if he wanted a change; as the father did not move for modification of custody or file an affidavit as required by KRS 403.340 and 403.350, a trial court had no jurisdiction and improperly modified the custodial arrangement on its own motion. Crouch v. Crouch, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 191 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 2, 2005), aff'd, 201 S.W.3d 463, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 227 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a father’s pursuit of custody modification occurred within two (2) years of the custody award, he had to file a motion under KRS 403.340(2) and file affidavits showing grounds for modification pursuant to KRS 403.350. Since he failed to do so, the trial court had no authority to modify custody, and the mother should have been permitted to relocate with the children. Robinson v. Robinson, 211 S.W.3d 63, 2006 Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The show-cause order entered pursuant to this section does no more than give the custodial parent notice of the court’s decision to have a hearing on the motion to modify the custody decree and does not place the burden of proof on the custodial parent. Wilcher v. Wilcher, 566 S.W.2d 173, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 516 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section should not be construed to place the burden of proof upon the custodial parent at a hearing of a motion to modify a prior custody decree, since such a construction would defeat the obvious purpose of KRS 403.340 and this section to encourage stability in the custodial relationship. Wilcher v. Wilcher, 566 S.W.2d 173, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 516 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a father’s verified complaint seeking modification of custody was a written statement or declaration, signed by the father and sworn to before a notary public, the complaint technically fulfilled the requirements of CR 43.13.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error to grant a motion to modify child custody in the mother’s absence. Because the divorce had terminated the relationship between the mother and her attorney as a matter of law, and because the attorney’s filing of a notice of nonrepresentation put the trial court and opposing counsel on notice that she no longer represented the mother, a new hearing date should have been set and service of the motion and notice under KRS 403.350 made directly upon the mother under CR 5.02. Murphy v. Murphy, 272 S.W.3d 864, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 310 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court denied the father’s right to due process when it proceeded to hear the mother’s motion to change custody because her custody modification motion had not been scheduled to be heard under KRS 403.350 and the father had received no notice of such a hearing. Corns v. Corns, 343 S.W.3d 622, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 113 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Setting the father’s motion, which the trial court erroneously treated as a motion for a change in custody, for a hearing under KRS 403.350 did not satisfy the due process requirement that the father receive notice that the court was hearing the mother’s request for a change in custody. Corns v. Corns, 343 S.W.3d 622, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 113 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a family court had been granted jurisdiction by statute over cases seeking a modification of custody, an error with respect to affidavits did not divest it of subject matter jurisdiction; rather, it simply gave an aggrieved party the opportunity for relief. However, because a mother failed to raise the issue, she waived a challenge to the affidavit requirement. (Petrey v. Cain, 987 S.W.2d 786, 1999 Ky. LEXIS 28 (Ky. 1999), is overruled to the extent that it holds that a circuit court or a family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a motion to modify child custody simply because the motion was not compliant with the requirement for more than one affidavit.)

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if the father had intended to move for custody modification, the mother’s verified response would, at most, represent an opposing affidavit under KRS 403.350, and would not satisfy the strict statutory requirements necessary for the father’s motion to have conveyed subject matter jurisdiction to the trial court.

Conversely, if the accused has fled from the scene of the attack and the officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the accused intentionally or wantonly caused physical injury to the victim and still presents an immediate threat of danger, for example, because the accused may return to the victim’s dwelling or other location or because the accused may follow, menace, stalk, or otherwise stay in the vicinity of the victim; a warrantless arrest under KRS 431.005(2) would be justified.

Commonwealth v. Anderson, 934 S.W.2d 276, 1996 Ky. LEXIS 121 (Ky. 1996).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence did not support a finding that defendant had been a victim of domestic violence in that he did not offer proof that he had ever suffered physical injury or serious physical injury or that he had been sexually abused or assaulted as a result of his wife’s actions and although wife had threatened to harm him and burn down their house neither he nor other family members testified that they actually feared she would carry out her threats and defendant was not aware of her threats until after the shooting, the Circuit Court properly denied defendant’s motion for exemption from the restrictions of KRS 439.3401 and 533.060. Jacobs v. Commonwealth, 947 S.W.2d 416, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 7 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court properly issued a domestic violence order restraining a father, under KRS 403.750; the court did not consider hearsay evidence regarding comments a minor child allegedly made to a babysitter concerning sexual abuse of the child by the father, and the testimony of the mother and a social worker regarding their own actions and observations as to the child supported the trial court’s ruling. S.L.T. v. R.J.C., 196 S.W.3d 530, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 204 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Preponderance of the evidence supported the issuance of a domestic violence order against a husband based on a wife’s testimony, which included testimony that the husband had threatened the wife in the past and that she was fearful of him. Gomez v. Gomez, 254 S.W.3d 838, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was entitled to post-conviction relief under RCr 11.42 because the trial court committed clear error in determining that the domestic violence exception to the violent offender statute, KRS 439.3401(5), did not apply to defendant where defendant’s sister was involved in an ongoing relationship with a homicide victim that was frequently punctuated by domestic violence, where the homicide victim fled the sister’s apartment after one such violent episode and the sister was taken to the hospital for medical treatment, where defendant and other family members went to the apartment to repair a phone broken in the altercation and the homicide victim returned, where they ordered the homicide victim to leave but he refused, and where defendant, after the homicide victim advanced menacingly toward him, fired seven shots and killed the homicide victim. The exception applied because the facts showed that a family member of defendant — his sister — was a domestic violence victim as defined in KRS 403.720(2), that the homicide victim and defendant’s sister were members of an unmarried couple as defined in KRS 403.720(3), that the violence between the homicide victim and defendant’s sister satisfied the definition of domestic violence under KRS 403.720(1), and that a connection existed between the domestic violence and the victim’s death. Fuston v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 140 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2009 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1088 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2009), review denied, ordered not published, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 31 (Ky. Jan. 13, 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because appellant’s actions were more akin to unwanted touching, which standing alone would not meet the definition of domestic violence, under KRS 403.720(1), 403.750(1), the family court did not show that domestic violence and abuse had occurred and might occur again and erred in granting a domestic violence order to appellee. Telek v. Daugherty, 376 S.W.3d 623, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 154 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Entry of a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) against the former husband was improper under KRS 403.740 because, although the trial court did have jurisdiction to enter the DVO, it erred in entering the DVO since the record did not support by a preponderance of the evidence that domestic violence might occur again. The former wife’s monosyllabic responses to her attorney’s leading questions regarding verbal abuse and her fear of future abuse similar to the altercation between the parties was insufficient. Guenther v. Guenther, 379 S.W.3d 796, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 174 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inquiry was whether substantial evidence supported a finding that the ex-boyfriend inflicted upon his ex-girlfriend a fear of imminent physical injury or assault; she said she felt threatened and believed her ex-boyfriend was unable to control his emotions and his aggressive confrontations would escalate, and the trial court could have inferred that the ex-girlfriend feared imminent injury, such that the finding of domestic violence was not clearly erroneous, and the denial of the ex-boyfriend’s motion to vacate the order was proper. Hohman v. Dery, 371 S.W.3d 780, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 330 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in entering a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) as appellant made serious threats of domestic violence against appellee because appellant did not have the right to protect himself under the castle doctrine as appellant granted appellee permission to pick up their child's shoes from his house within 48 hours of the incident; appellant was not threatened or intimidated by appellee to the point that he felt he needed to use deadly force to protect himself; his text message that she had no right to be on his property and that he would shoot her if she ever came back constituted an imminent threat of domestic violence; and serious threats of physical violence were made and could continue to be made by appellant. Gibson v. Campbell-Marletta, 503 S.W.3d 186, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 185 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred in denying an incarcerated father visitation with his children because there was a statutory presumption that visitation was in the child's best interest, a maternal uncle could not act as the grandfather's “attorney-in-fact” inasmuch as such representation entailed the unauthorized practice of law, and his statements constituted inadmissible hearsay, and while domestic violence and abuse were alleged, the matter was not properly filed where there was no custody order in the paternity action, and should be filed where custody had been determined. Baldwin v. Mollette, 527 S.W.3d 830, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 467 (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s finding that the dispute between defendant and the boyfriend being over money somehow excluded it from also being an act of domestic violence was erroneous where the boyfriend’s taking defendant’s money was an act of domestic violence in the context of the extensive evidence about the couple’s relationship. Roberts v. Commonwealth, 599 S.W.3d 841, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 69 (Ky. 2020).</p>

Ireland v. Davis, 957 S.W.2d 310, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 131 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 403.720(2) was ambiguous in its method of determining kinship within the second degree, and since, in interpreting an ambiguous penal statute, doubt was to have been resolved in favor of the accused, the common law method for computing kinship was applied in interpreting KRS 403.720(2); use of the common law method for computing kinship brought defendant’s manslaughter case within the availability of the exception for victims of domestic violence, since the victim, defendant’s cousin, was related to defendant’s mother in the second degree, and defendant claimed that he shot the victim after the victim had attacked and choked defendant’s mother. Kirby v. Commonwealth, 132 S.W.3d 233, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 82 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 403.720(3) (now (4)) does not define “living together,” courts give substance to this language, and in doing so they should focus on the purpose of the statute rather than technicalities; the point of domestic violence legislation is to protect victims from harm caused by the persons whose intimate physical relationship to the victim increases the danger of harm, either because the parties live in physical proximity or because the relationship is one whose intimacy may disable the victim from seeking protection. Barnett v. Wiley, 103 S.W.3d 17, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 68 (Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Phrase “living together” in KRS 403.720(3) (now (4)) implies some sort of cohabitation; this is consistent with the dictionary definition of “cohabitation,” which means the fact or state of living together, especially as partners in life, usually with the suggestion of sexual relations.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellee first individual was not a “member of an unmarried couple” within the meaning of KRS 403.725, and therefore lacked standing to seek a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) against appellant second individual where the parties were not related; had no children together; and were not “living together” within the meaning of KRS 403.720(3) (now (4)) given that they had never shared living quarters, either on a temporary or permanent basis.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s issuance of a domestic violence order was clearly erroneous because it was not supported by substantial evidence; there was insufficient evidence that they were “living together” under KRS 403.720(3) (now (4)), since, while they dated for approximately 18 months, there was no evidence they had sexual relations while sharing living quarters, there was no evidence they shared living quarters, and there was no evidence they shared income or expenses, jointly owned or used any property, or presented themselves as husband and wife. Randall v. Stewart, 223 S.W.3d 121, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 64 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the parties did not share financial resources, own property jointly, or live in circumstances indicative of cohabitation, they were not “members of an unmarried couple” as defined in KRS 403.720; therefore, a domestic violence order could not be issued against the boyfriend pursuant to KRS 403.725. Rivers v. Howell, 276 S.W.3d 279, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 378 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant killed his sister’s abusive boyfriend, substantial evidence supported a conclusion that defendant’s sister and the boyfriend were members of an unmarried couple under subsection (3) (now (4)) for purposes of the domestic violence exception to the violent offender statute under KRS 439.3401(5) because the evidence established that the boyfriend resided in the sister’s apartment and help pay the bills. Further, a district court had previously determined that the boyfriend and defendant’s sister were members of an unmarried couple when it entered a domestic violence order under KRS 403.725, which clearly required that only a family member or member of an unmarried couple could obtain such an order. Fuston v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 140 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2009 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1088 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2009), review denied, ordered not published, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 31 (Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court issued erroneous jury instructions on a fleeing charge because no mention was made of the statutory term, “unmarried couple” in KRS 403.720; the instructions were at odds with KRS 520.095, which required the jury to find defendant was “fleeing immediately after committing an act of domestic violence.” The jury was not instructed to find that defendant and the complainant were members of an unmarried couple.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In regard to a protective order, the distinction between prohibitory and affirmative orders represents the fairest balance between protecting the due process rights of a nonresident defendant and the state’s clearly-articulated interest in protecting a spouse and a child against domestic violence. Spencer v. Spencer, 191 S.W.3d 14, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 115 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Girlfriend could have filed a petition on behalf of the boyfriend’s nephew but the girlfriend’s petition clearly was not filed on the nephew’s behalf; the girlfriend filed the petition on her own behalf, and thus, her petition could not justify entry of an order protecting the boyfriend, and that portion of the domestic violence order (DVO) prohibiting the boyfriend’s contact with his nephew had to be stricken from the DVO. Hunter v. Mena, 302 S.W.3d 93, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 4 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the purposes of the domestic violence statutes, two homosexual men living together in an intimate relationship are not family members but are members of an “unmarried couple who are living together” and, thus, may benefit from the protection of the domestic violence statutes by filing petitions for a domestic violence order and for a restraining order.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Six (6) Kellogg factors (i.e., sexual relations between the parties while sharing the same living quarters, sharing of income or expenses, joint use or ownership of property, whether the parties hold themselves out as husband and wife, the continuity of the relationship, and the length of the relationship) are relevant in determining whether two (2) people are “living together” within the meaning of KRS 403.720, but, under the plain language of that statute, there must be, at a minimum, proof that the petitioner seeking a Domestic Violence Order shares or has shared living quarters with the respondent before a finding can be made that the two are an “unmarried couple” under KRS 403.725. Barnett v. Wiley, 103 S.W.3d 17, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 68 (Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellee first individual was not a “member of an unmarried couple” within the meaning of KRS 403.725, and therefore lacked standing to seek a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) against appellant second individual where the parties were not related; had no children together; and were not “living together” within the meaning of KRS 403.720(3) given that they had never shared living quarters, either on a temporary or permanent basis. Accordingly, the trial court erred in issuing a DVO against the second individual. Barnett v. Wiley, 103 S.W.3d 17, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 68 (Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the plain language of the statute, there had to be, at a minimum, proof that the alleged victim shared or had shared living quarters with the alleged attacker before a finding could be made that the two were an “unmarried couple” under KRS 403.725. Randall v. Stewart, 223 S.W.3d 121, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 64 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining standing to seek a domestic violence order as a member of an unmarried couple, the court should consider whether there was evidence of: (1) sexual relations between the parties while sharing the same living quarters; (2) sharing of income or expenses; (3) joint use or ownership of property; (4) holding themselves out as husband and wife; (5) the continuity of the relationship; and (6) the length of the relationship.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the parties did not share financial resources, own property jointly, or live in circumstances indicative of cohabitation, they were not “members of an unmarried couple” as defined in KRS 403.720; therefore, the girlfriend lacked standing to pursue a domestic violence order against the boyfriend pursuant to KRS 403.725.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit Court properly denied a father’s petition for injunctive relief in which he sought an order prohibiting the Family Court from enforcing its domestic violence order, as the mother was entitled to seek protection against allegations that the father physically abused his children under KRS 403.725(1).

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over the husband, who was not a resident of Kentucky, insofar as the protective order prohibited him from breaking the law in Kentucky by approaching the wife and child, it comported with due process; in all other respects, it went beyond the permissible limits of Kentucky courts’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>jurisdiction.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unlike the residency requirements to establish home-state jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, KRS 403.800 et seq., there is no minimum time period under KRS 403.725 to establish residency for entry of a domestic violence order (DVO). As a mother had clearly re-established her residency in Kentucky, the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction to grant her a DVO. Bissell v. Baumgardner, 236 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a father, who was domiciled in Utah, made an alleged threat to kill their son’s mother in Kentucky, that state had personal jurisdiction over him in the mother’s action to obtain a domestic violence order.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family Court, as a division of the Circuit Court, had jurisdiction to enter a domestic violence order even though a District Court had denied an emergency protective order due to the fact that a dissolution proceeding involving the parties was pending within the Circuit Court. Gomez v. Gomez, 254 S.W.3d 838, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contrary to a husband’s arguments, the fact that a District Court declined to issue an emergency protective order did not leave a Family Court without jurisdiction to issue a domestic violence order subsequent to a hearing on a wife’s petition; under KRS 23A.100(3), the Family Court was the primary forum for cases involving domestic violence and abuse although the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction to enter protective orders under KRS 403.725. Gomez v. Gomez, 254 S.W.3d 838, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 145 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction where there was no evidence that it was the girlfriend’s intent to establish permanent residency in Indiana and abandon her Kentucky domicile; absent that intent, the girlfriend’s temporary residence out of the state, even for an indefinite period, would not constitute the party a non-resident.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (U.C.C.J.A.) (now Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, see KRS 403.800 et seq.), applied to all cases, regardless of whether the custody order originated with the court now asked to consider a change of custody, or originated elsewhere. By the terms of the act a court entering an original custody decree may be required to refuse jurisdiction of a subsequent motion to change custody because of a child’s present living arrangements and place of residence; thus, the U.C.C.J.A. was a threshold consideration in every case, and the prefatory reference to it in KRS 403.340(2) did no more than make clear that when a court is asked to entertain a change of custody case it shall not do so unless the circumstances covered by the U.C.C.J.A. are present. Quisenberry v. Quisenberry, 785 S.W.2d 485, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 29 (Ky. 1990) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a natural parent’s same-sex partner sought joint custody of a child they agreed to conceive through artificial insemination and parent together as a family, the partner had standing to seek custody of the child under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act where the partner claimed a right to legal custody of the child under both an agreed judgment of custody and pursuant to a waiver theory, satisfying the requirement of KRS 403.800(13)(b). Mullins v. Picklesimer, 317 S.W.3d 569, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 7 (Ky. 2010), limited, S.R.V. v. J.S.B., 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 127 (Ky. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2020).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that a family court applied the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, KRS 403.800 et seq., as a tool to resolve substantive factual questions upon which custody or visitation/timesharing determinations were based in parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>custody dispute, such was error; there were no jurisdictional issues before the court. N.B. v. C.H., 351 S.W.3d 214, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 250 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Couple, whose husband was a first cousin of the father’s minor twin children, lacked standing under KRS 403.822(1)(b) to seek custody of the minor twin children after their mother died and, thus, the trial court could not have awarded joint custody of the minor twin children as well as the father. Although the couple had KRS 403.800(14) physical custody of the minor twin children in the sense that the couple were their caretakers and physically supervised them, the couple did not qualify as KRS 403.800(13) persons acting as parents because their petition for custody had not been filed after they had the twins in their care for at least six months. Wethington v. Coffey, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 201 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2012), rev'd, 421 S.W.3d 394, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 12 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Proper Forum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where McCracken County had been the residence of both divorced spouses and their children for the last two years, evidence concerning custody of children could best be produced by witnesses living in that county and it was a convenient forum for the controversy, there was no statutory prohibition or inconsistency in allowing the case to be heard in McCracken County instead of Union County where the divorce decree and custody agreement were originally entered, since the enactment of KRS 403.110 et seq. and former KRS 403.400 et seq. has eroded the doctrine of exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the original court in custody cases, and where former law regarding jurisdiction in custody cases gave sufficient guidance and direction to establish the proper forum. Shumaker v. Paxton, 613 S.W.2d 130, 1981 Ky. LEXIS 219 (Ky. 1981), overruled in part, Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 2004 Ky. LEXIS 196 (Ky. 2004) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where young child had lived his entire life in Ohio, and was brought by father, in a surreptitious manner, to Kentucky two days prior to the filing of marriage dissolution action, and there was no evidence in the record to show that it would be in the best interest of the child for Kentucky to exercise jurisdiction, but to the contrary, the record showed that the best interest of this small child would be served by leaving his future to the authorities in Ohio, who cared for him, supervised him and provided for him since his birth, Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to award custody in action filed by father and a writ of prohibition was the appropriate remedy. Wood v. Graham, 633 S.W.2d 404, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 251 (Ky. 1982) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Full Faith and Credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Portions of a Texas decree pertaining to child support and custody should not have been given full faith and credit, since the decree was from a state that had not adopted the uniform act and therefore was not entitled to full faith and credit in Kentucky courts, and since the father made no appearance in the Texas courts. Green v. Bruenning, 690 S.W.2d 770, 1985 Ky. App. LEXIS 582 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The primary responsibility in child support and visitation issues under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act lies on counsel for the “home state” party, who should make sure that the record shows that the sister state has lost jurisdiction or declined to exercise it. If the sister state refuses to give up its jurisdiction, and if a party disagrees with the assumption of continuing jurisdiction by that other state, the appropriate remedy should be by appeal through the appellate courts of that state and then, if necessary, to the United States Supreme Court. The courts of this Commonwealth, however, should not be acting as appellate courts with respect to decisions by courts of other states. Cann v. Howard, 850 S.W.2d 57, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 20 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A clear difference exists between enforcement jurisdiction and modification jurisdiction with respect to child custody disputes; this difference works no change in existing Kentucky law related to the requirements for jurisdiction over original decree or modification disputes that do fall within the purview of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) or the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brighty v. Brighty, 883 S.W.2d 494, 1994 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1994) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once Texas assumed jurisdiction of the right to visitation of two (2) children and modified the visitation order, there no longer existed an enforceable Kentucky visitation order for the father to attempt to enforce through a motion for contempt; accordingly, the Kentucky court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a visitation order that had been superceded by the order from the Texas court and was no longer valid. Scott v. Summers, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 99 (Ky. Ct. App. May 9, 2003), aff'd, 2005 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 204 (Ky. June 16, 2005) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a mother argued that a trial court lacked personal jurisdiction to modify visitation under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, since the trial court retained jurisdiction for matters of custody from January 14, 2004, until March 10, 2004 and the trial court exercised jurisdiction over such matters on February 25, 2004, and there was no additional order prior to or on March 10, 2004, the period of time over which the trial court retained jurisdiction had passed, and the mother had failed to identify any relief that could be granted. Gibson v. Gibson, 211 S.W.3d 601, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 390 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither Texas nor Florida were proper forum to adjudicate child custody where Texas was place of birth of the child but none of the parties involved had any recent contact with Texas, and Florida was initially the child’s home state, as defined in this section, only because father took her there in violation of previous custody order and kept her whereabouts concealed from mother for more than two (2) years; Kentucky was properly considered as the child’s home state as a result of a two and one-half (21/2) year stay consented to by father. Pike v. Aigner, 828 S.W.2d 674, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 78 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky court had jurisdiction over custody dispute between birth parents and adoptive parents pursuant to former KRS 403.420(1) because the action filed by birth parents for immediate entitlement and custody was a “custody proceeding” under former KRS 403.410(3); although Kentucky was not the child’s home state pursuant to former KRS 403.410(5) when the action was commenced, and although Ohio, where the child resided with the adoptive parents, could have qualified as the child’s home state, Kentucky had been the child’s home state within six (6) months before commencement of the proceeding, Ohio had previously yielded to Kentucky and declined to exercise jurisdiction, and Ohio had recognized that Kentucky was the proper forum in which to assert jurisdiction over the matter. Moore v. Asente, 110 S.W.3d 336, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 149 (Ky. 2003), rehearing denied, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 2003), rehearing denied, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 2003) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unlike the residency requirements to establish home-state jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, KRS 403.800 et seq., there is no minimum time period under KRS 403.725 to establish residency for entry of a domestic violence order (DVO). As a mother had clearly re-established her residency in Kentucky, the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction to grant her a DVO. Bissell v. Baumgardner, 236 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 304 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mother resided in Utah for 11 months prior to returning to Kentucky, and at the time of her domestic violence order hearing, she had been in Kentucky for less than six months, and since there was a pending dissolution and custody proceeding in Utah, Utah remained the child’s home state under KRS 403.800(7). Therefore, the child custody determination was subject to the Utah courts under KRS 403.822(1)(a). Bissell v. Baumgardner, 236 S.W.3d 24, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 304 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a grandfather's custody petition because (1) the children lived with the grandfather for over six months, and (2) the grandfather was a “person acting as a parent,” due to having physical custody and being awarded temporary custody.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lambert v. Lambert, 475 S.W.3d 646, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 155 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in finding Colorado did not have jurisdiction in a child custody matter because, accepting a mother’s statement of facts as true due to a father’s failure to file an appellate brief, the children’s absence from Colorado and presence in Kentucky was temporary, as that was the parties’ intent and agreement, and, thus, the temporary absence was included in finding the children had resided in Colorado for more than six months, making Colorado the children’s home state and depriving the trial court of jurisdiction. Dellapenta v. Goldy, 575 S.W.3d 697, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 256 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>6. Physical Custody.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Physical custody” under former KRS 403.410(8) for the purposes of establishing standing in a custody dispute required more than “actual possession and control of a child” at the time a custody action is commenced because it required a showing that a parent has somehow voluntarily and indefinitely relinquished custody of the child; under that standard, adoptive parents had standing under former KRS 403.420(4)(b) to pursue custody of a child where the birth parents had filed an action to terminate their parental rights and to transfer the child’s custody to the adoptive parents and where the birth parents did not file the action to regain custody until almost six (6) months after they had placed the child with adoptive parents. Moore v. Asente, 110 S.W.3d 336, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 149 (Ky. 2003), rehearing denied, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 2003), rehearing denied, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 2003) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mother's former partner was not a “person acting as a parent” who would have standing to pursue custody, as the former partner and the child had not lived together during the relevant period of time. W.R.L. v. A.H., 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 52 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2015 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 668 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2015).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Issue of standing turned on whether the couple fell within the category of a person acting as a parent as required by the statute, as there was no dispute that they met the other requirements. Coffey v. Wethington, 421 S.W.3d 394, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 12 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of a person acting as a parent, the six-month requirement does not apply to those currently in physical custody of the child, as the couple clearly was at the commencement of this action; if the legislature had intended that the six-month requirement apply to those currently having custody of the child, then it would have indicated that by using “and” instead of “or,” and the court concluded that the couple had standing. Coffey v. Wethington, 421 S.W.3d 394, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 12 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Grandmother had standing to bring a petition for custody and/or visitation because she was a person acting as a parent based on the fact that she helped the 15-year-old mother with the child after its birth; however, she was not a de facto custodian because her care did not supplant that of the mother's. Inter alia, the mother sought and received government benefits for the child, entered custody agreements, and held herself out as the child's custodian throughout several court proceedings. Chadwick v. Flora, 488 S.W.3d 640, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 67 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At common law, grandparents had no legal right to visitation; however, the General Assembly determined that, in modern day society, it was essential that some semblance of family and generational contact be preserved. If a grandparent is physically, mentally and morally fit, then a grandchild will ordinarily benefit from contact with the grandparent. That grandparents and grandchildren normally have a special bond cannot be denied. Each benefits from contact with the other. These considerations by the state do not go too far in intruding into the fundamental rights of the parents. Thus, the Supreme Court found that this section is constitutional. King v. King, 828 S.W.2d 630, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 44 (Ky.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 941, 113 S. Ct. 378, 121 L. Ed. 2d 289, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 6648 (U.S. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in determining that subsections (b) and (c) of the grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional because it did not analyze the facts of the case upon the standard of a constitutional presumption that a fit parent acted in the child’s best interest, and that the presumption was a starting point for analysis, the requirements required as a prerequisite that the grandparent seeking visitation must prove he or she had a “pre-existing significant and viable relationship with the child.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robison v. Pinto, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 169 (September 27, 2019).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case in which the maternal grandparents sought visitation, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 405.021(1)(b) and (c), on their face, ran afoul of a parent’s fundamental constitutional right to the care and custody of his or her child under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutory scheme failed to accord the requisite “special weight” to the parent’s determination regarding his or her child; and it did not comply with the presumption in favor of the parent as it stated that, if a grandparent could prove the existence of a significant and viable relationship with the child merely by a preponderance of the evidence, the grandparent was then entitled to a presumption in his or her favor. Pinto v. Robison, 607 S.W.3d 669, 2020 Ky. LEXIS 301 (Ky. 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The overriding considerations expressed through the termination and adoption statutes for cutting, finally and irrevocably, all connections to the biological parent and his family where there has been a final order terminating parental rights and where there has been an adoption introducing the child into a new family, simply do not apply where there has been only a stepparent adoption with no prior legal severance of the bond to the grandparents. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As amended, this section provides that visitation rights granted to grandparents are not affected by termination of their child’s parental rights unless the court finds that it is in the best interest of the grandchild to do so. The amendment is remedial, so applies to cases decided prior, as well as subsequent, to its July 1996 enactment. Dotson v. Rowe, 957 S.W.2d 269, 1997 Ky. App. LEXIS 72 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Grandmother’s statutory right to grandparent visitation under KRS 405.021 was foreclosed by the termination of her daughter’s parental rights to the children since the grandmother was not previously granted visitation by the Circuit Court; the fact that an order in the dependency action referred to grandparent visitation did not change the result, since that order was issued by the District Court and not the Circuit Court. E.D. v. Commonwealth, 152 S.W.3d 261, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 337 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in awarding grandparents additional visitation since they had not petitioned for such relief under KRS 405.021, the trial court did not find that additional visitation would be in the children’s best interest, and the trial court did not consider the factors set out in <i>Vibbert v. Vibbert,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> 144 S.W.3d 292, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 246 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).VanWinkle v. Petry, 217 S.W.3d 252, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 18 (Ky. Ct.

But as the grandparents had been granted visitation pursuant to KRS 405.021, they remained parties to the dissolution action to that extent; therefore, they could not be dismissed from that action. VanWinkle v. Petry, 217 S.W.3d 252, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 18 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court erred in ordering grandparent visitation because the grandmother engaged in extraordinary acts of hostility toward the children’s mother and father, there was extreme acrimony between the grandmother and the mother, and the grandmother stated that she wished her son would divorce the mother. Grayson v. Grayson, 319 S.W.3d 426, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 127 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly determined that KRS 405.021(1), rather than KRS 405.021(3), was applicable to a grandmother’s request for visitation with a mother’s child following the death of the child’s father, as the grandmother did not indicate any intention to seek noncustodial parental visitation, which was for a greater amount. Walker v. Blair, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 179 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 982 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No matter how well-intended, a grandparent’s petition for visitation beyond a parent’s consent is an attack upon that parent’s superior and fundamental right to make her own determination of her child’s best interest.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Grandparents sought visitation pursuant to the statute, but the court failed to make the required finding that grandparents met the criterion of assuming the financial obligation of child support, and there was no order imposing upon the grandparents the child support obligation of their son, and reversal was required.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court properly denied the motions by a maternal grandfather and step-grandmother (jointly, the grandparents) to intervene and to hold the termination proceedings in abeyance because they did not have a statutory or tangible interest in the underlying action, they did not include a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention was sought, they had other means to achieve relief, they did not show how the termination of parental rights petition against the subject child’s father would affect any petition they would file for grandparent visitation or future motions for custody or visitation, and they did not raise any arguments regarding the denial of the motion to hold the termination proceedings in abeyance.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court must assume that the 1976 grandparents’ visitation rights statute was written with the language of the termination and adoption statutes in KRS Chapter 199 in mind.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In 1984 the General Assembly expanded this section by deleting its limitation to the situation where the “parent is deceased,” but it did not change the basic premise that it was subject to the overriding importance of the termination and adoption statutes to the welfare of children.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in dismissing appellant’s action for grandparent visitation, because she failed to seek visitation when she still had a right to do so under KRS ch. 405 before her daughter’s parental rights were terminated.

Since such visitation was in the best interests of the two children, the maternal grandmother was entitled to the reasonable visitation with them as awarded by the trial court. Grant v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a grandparent visitation case, a trial court erred in applying the heightened clear and convincing standard because the child at issue was in the custody of his aunt and uncle by marriage; they did not have the same fundamental liberty interests as parents simply due to the fact that they received custody. A rehearing was necessary on the best interest standard alone, with no presumptions or preferences given as to the nonparental custodians. Navy v. Massie, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 120 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2015 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 860 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>12. Burden of Proof.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute has not been interpreted to require a grandparent to clearly show that visitation is in a child's best interest against anyone besides a parent; the text of the statute does not contain an express requirement that the clear and convincing standard always applies when a grandparent petitions for custody. Moreover, a lesser preponderance of the evidence standard has been acknowledged. Navy v. Massie, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 120 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2015 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 860 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2015).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did err by terminating the grandmother's petition for custody and visitation without determining whether she, as a non-de facto custodian, could have demonstrated that the parents were unfit custodians, or whether they waived their superior right to custodial status. Moreover, the grandmother was required to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the parents were acting in the child's best interests, and she had to prove that visitation with the grandmother was in the child's best interests. Chadwick v. Flora, 488 S.W.3d 640, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 67 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a grandparent seeks the intervention of the courts to compel visitation, the decision of the parent must prevail absent a clear and convincing showing by the grandparent in favor of such visitation; anything less would elevate the grandparent to equal status with a custodial parent. Goodlett v. Brittain, 544 S.W.3d 656, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 92 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Without a fundamental constitutional right at issue, there is no authority for imposing the clear and convincing standard on the best interest of the child analysis. Unless the legislature provides otherwise, the nonparent custodian and a grandparent are on equal footing under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 405.021(1)(a) and the preponderance of the evidence standard for determining whether grandparent visitation is in the child’s best interest is fundamentally fair and proper. Morton v. Tipton, 569 S.W.3d 388, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2019).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Going forward, trial courts must use the preponderance of the evidence standard when considering grandparent visitation if someone other than a parent, including another grandparent, is the grandchild’s custodian. Morton v. Tipton, 569 S.W.3d 388, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2019).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a trial court did not explicitly identify the standard of proof, its statement about the parents’ rights, whose whereabouts were unknown, strongly suggested that it correctly employed the typical preponderance of the evidence standard.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> When a parent presents himself to the cabinet for the voluntary establishment of paternity and clear evidence of parentage is not present, the cabinet shall pay when administratively ordered the cost of genetic testing to establish paternity, subject to recoupment from the alleged father when paternity is established.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> The cabinet shall obtain additional testing in any case if an original test is contested, upon request and advance payment by the contestant.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> In a contested paternity case, the child, the mother, and the putative father shall submit to genetic testing upon a request of any of the parties, unless the person or guardian of the person who is requested to submit to genetic testing shows good cause, taking into account the best interests of the child, why the genetic tests cannot be performed. The request shall be supported by a sworn statement of the party, requesting that the test be performed, which shall include the information required by 42 U.S.C. sec. 666(a)(5)(B)(i) or (ii).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> When a parent who fails to support a child is not obligated to provide child support by court order, the cabinet may administratively establish a child support obligation based upon a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity as set forth in KRS Chapter 406, the parent’s minimum monthly child support obligation and proportionate share of child care costs incurred due to employment or job search of either parent, or incurred while receiving elementary or secondary education, or higher education or vocational training which will lead to employment. The monthly child support obligation shall be determined pursuant to the Kentucky child support guidelines set forth in KRS 403.212. The actual cost of child care shall be reasonable and shall be allocated between the parents in the same proportion as each parent’s gross income, as determined under the guidelines, bears to the total family gross income.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> The cabinet shall recognize a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity as a basis for seeking a support order, irrespective of the alleged father’s willingness to consent to a support order.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> When in the best interest of the child, the cabinet may review and adjust a parent’s child support obligation or child care obligation as established by the cabinet, upon a request of the cabinet when an assignment has been made, or upon either parent’s petition if the amount of the child support awarded under the order differs from the amount that would be awarded in accordance with KRS 403.212. The cabinet shall notify parents at least once every three (3) years of the right to a review.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> In establishing or modifying a parent’s monthly child support obligation, the cabinet may use automated methods to identify orders eligible for review, conduct the review, identify orders eligible for adjustment, and apply the adjustment to eligible orders in accordance with KRS 403.212. The cabinet shall utilize information, including financial records, about the parent and child which it has good reason to believe is reliable and may require the parents to provide income verification.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> In cases in which past-due support is owed for a child receiving public assistance under Title IV-A of the Federal Social Security Act, the cabinet shall issue an administrative order, or seek a judicial order, requiring the obligated parent to participate in work activities, or educational or vocational training activities for at least twenty (20) hours per week, unless the parent is incapacitated as defined by 42 U.S.C. sec. 607.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> The cabinet may disclose financial records only for the purpose of establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support obligation of an individual. A financial institution shall not be liable to any individual for disclosing any financial record of the individual to the cabinet attempting to establish, modify, or enforce a child support obligation.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(10)</b> The cabinet may issue both intrastate and interstate administrative subpoenas to any individual or entity for financial or other information or documents which are needed to establish, modify, or enforce a child support obligation pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. secs. 651 et seq. An administrative subpoena lawfully issued in another state to an individual or entity residing in this state shall be honored and enforced in the Circuit Court of the county in which the individual or entity resides.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(11)</b> In any case where a person or entity fails to respond to a subpoena within the specified time frame, the cabinet shall impose a penalty.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(12)</b> No person shall knowingly make, present, or cause to be made or presented to an employee or officer of the cabinet any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement, representation, or entry in any application, report, document, or financial record used in determining child support or child care obligations.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(13)</b> If a person knowingly or by reason of negligence discloses a financial record of an individual, that individual may pursue civil action for damages in a federal District Court or appropriate state court. No liability shall arise with respect to any disclosure which results from a good faith, but erroneous, interpretation. In any civil action brought for reason of negligence of disclosure of financial records, upon finding of liability on the part of the defendant, the defendant shall be liable to the plaintiff in an amount equal to:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The sum of the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each act of unauthorized disclosure of financial records; or</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(14)</b> The cabinet shall issue an administrative order or seek a judicial order requiring a parent with a delinquent child support obligation, as defined by administrative regulation promulgated under KRS 15.055, to participate in the program described in KRS 205.732 to help low-income, noncustodial parents find and keep employment unless the parent is incapacitated as defined by 42 U.S.C. sec. 607.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> All support orders issued by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, including those issued pursuant to Part D, Title IV of the Federal Social Security Act, shall provide for immediate withholding of earnings of the parent or parents obligated to pay child support and medical support as is necessary to pay the child support obligation, except where one (1) of the parties demonstrates, and the court or administrative order finds that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or a written agreement is reached by both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> In any case in which a support order was issued in the state and in which a parent is required to pay court-ordered or administratively determined child support, medical support, maintenance, and medical support insurance, and wage withholding is not in effect, and an arrearage accrues that is equal to the amount of support payment for one (1) month, upon request of the absent parent, request of the custodial parent, or upon administrative determination, the secretary shall issue an order for withholding of earnings of the parent as is necessary to comply with the order plus interest at the legal rate on the arrearage, if any, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> If a court-ordered arrearage repayment amount does not exist and an arrearage accrues that is equal to the amount of support payable for one (1) month, an arrearage repayment amount may be determined administratively. The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations establishing the guidelines for arrearage payments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> In any case in which a parent is required either by court order or administrative order to provide medical insurance coverage for the child and the parent has failed to make application to obtain coverage for the child, the secretary shall issue an order for withholding of the employee’s share, if any, of premiums for health coverage and to pay the share of premiums to the insurer, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> The cabinet shall advise the obligated parent that a wage withholding has commenced by sending a copy of the order to withhold at the same time that the order is sent to the employer. The only basis for contesting the withholding shall be a mistake of fact or law. If the parent contests the withholding, the cabinet shall give the obligor an opportunity to present his or her case at an administrative hearing conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B and decide if the withholding will continue.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> The cabinet shall combine any administrative or judicial wage withholding order, or multiple administrative or judicial orders for child support and medical support into a single wage withholding order when payable through the cabinet to a single family or to multiple family units.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> The cabinet shall serve the order to withhold earnings or notice of multiple wage withholding orders specifying wage withholding requirements on the employer of an obligor by certified mail, return receipt requested. The order shall state the amount to be withheld, or the requirement to enroll the child under the health insurance coverage, including amounts to be applied to arrearages, plus interest at the legal rate on the arrearage, if any, and the date the withholding is to begin. The total amount to be withheld, including current support and payment on arrearages plus interest, and medical insurance coverage may not exceed the limit permitted under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act at 15 U.S.C. sec. 1673(b).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> If there is more than one (1) notice for child support withholding against a single absent parent, the cabinet shall allocate amounts available for withholding, giving priority to current child support, up to the limits imposed under Section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act at 15 U.S.C. sec. 1673(b). The allocation by the cabinet shall not result in a withholding for one (1) of the support obligations not being implemented. Amounts resulting from wage withholding shall be allocated on a proportionate basis between multiple family units. Any custodial parent adversely affected by the provisions of this subsection shall have standing to challenge any proportionate allocations and, for good cause shown, a District Court, Circuit Court, or family court of competent jurisdiction may set aside the cabinet’s proportional allocations as to the custodial parent.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> If the amounts to be withheld preclude collection of the total amount of combined child support and medical support due to the limits of the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act at 15 U.S.C. sec. 1673(b), the actual amount received shall be applied first to the current monthly child support obligation amount. Any payment exceeding the current monthly child support obligation shall then be applied by the cabinet to the administratively ordered or judicially ordered medical support obligation.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(10)</b> The employer shall forward to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services that portion of salary or wages of the parent due and to be due in the future as will be sufficient to pay the child support amount ordered.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(11)</b> The employer shall be held liable to the cabinet for any amount which the employer fails to withhold from earnings due an obligor following receipt of an order to withhold earnings.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(12)</b> Any order to withhold earnings under this section shall have priority as against any attachment, execution, or other assignment, notwithstanding any state statute or administrative regulation to the contrary.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(13)</b> No withholding under this section shall be grounds for discharging from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against any obligor subject to withholding required by this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(14)</b> The remedies provided for in this section shall also be available for applicable support orders issued in other states.</p>

<p class="p6">The father of a child which is or may be born out of wedlock is liable to the same extent as the father of a child born in wedlock, whether or not the child is born alive, for the reasonable expense of the mother’s pregnancy and confinement and for the education, necessary support and funeral expenses of the child. A child born during lawful wedlock, or within ten (10) months thereafter, is presumed to be the child of the husband and wife. However, a child born out of wedlock includes a child born to a married woman by a man other than her husband where evidence shows that the marital relationship between the husband and wife ceased ten (10) months prior to the birth of the child.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the spouses’ marital relationship did not fall into the category of having ceased ten months prior to child’s birth, it is uncontroverted that the husband was found in an earlier Circuit Court proceeding to not be the child’s father; that being so, the trial court certainly did not err by concluding that the presumption of legitimacy had been overcome by evidence so clear, distinct and convincing as to remove the question from the realm of reasonable doubt.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred by equitably estopping the father from denying his paternity because the child was not born during the marriage so there existed no presumption of paternity under KRS 406.011, the child knew that appellant was not her biological or natural father and, while he might have acted as the child’s natural father, the child, as well as he and the mother, knew that he was not, and, as such, he made no material misrepresentation to the child.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 406.011 set forth standing requirements for a third party to assert paternity of a child born during the lawful wedlock of a husband and wife; the mother did not challenge the biological father’s right to bring the action for nearly two years after he brought the paternity petition, and the mother waived any objection to the father’s standing to assert paternity.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mother was estopped from arguing that KRS 406.180 limited jurisdiction to children born “out of wedlock.” The mother and her husband judicially admitted that another man was the father of a child born during the marriage, and diagnostic testing confirmed the other man’s paternity; the mother’s judicial admissions were sufficient to rebut the presumption that her husband was the father of the child. S.B. v. M.C., 352 S.W.3d 345, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 151 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly required genetic testing under KRS 406.081, .091(2) because the man with whom the mother had an affair presented sufficient evidence of access to the mother to make him the child’s father under KRS 406.011, .021; the court properly entered an order of contempt against the mother for refusing to submit to testing because the court gave the mother four opportunities to submit to testing.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 406.051 provided a District Court with subject matter jurisdiction over an action to establish support for children born out of wedlock, that statutory provision did not apply in a case where the alleged father petitioned the Family Court for custody and support of child born to a wife of another. Kentucky paternity statutes did not apply and, thus, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction, because no evidence was presented to show that the child was born out of wedlock, which would have required a showing that the husband and wife’s marital relationship had ceased 10 months before the child’s birth, as set forth in KRS 406.011. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 2008), overruled in part, J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court had jurisdiction over an action to establish paternity to a child that was conceived while the married couple was legally separated and pursuing a divorce; the presumption of paternity applied under KRS 406.011, because the couple remarried the day before the child was born. Given the unusual facts of this case and the inherent rights of biological parents, the grant of joint custody to appellant former husband could not prevent appellee alleged biological father from pursuing his paternity action under the Uniform Act on Paternity, KRS ch. 406; the allegations and evidence of separation satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of KRS 406.011.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the putative father’s paternity action, not under KRS 406.011 because that statute did not define “child born out of wedlock,” but under KRS 406.051 and KRS 406.180 because the putative father’s action was one to determine the paternity of a child whose alleged biological parents were not married to each other as “marriage” was defined under Kentucky law. The putative father himself had standing to file the paternity action because the allegations contained in the putative father’s paternity complaint were sufficient to confer standing on the putative father under KRS 426.021, which allowed putative father’s to file a complaint to determine paternity.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a child was born after the effective date of the uniform act on paternity, a bastardy action may not be maintained in Kentucky unless the child was born in the state and was born out of wedlock to an unmarried woman. OAG 64-794.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering this chapter as a whole and noting that KRS 406.051 provides in part that all remedies under KRS Ch. 407 are available for enforcement of duties of support under this chapter, the county court has a continuing jurisdiction over paternity actions for the purpose of the child’s support as well as the future education of the child and thus the court can modify the original judgment as it pertains to the education of the child. OAG 73-354.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the husband has been in prison for two and one-half years without physical access to his wife and where the wife was pregnant on the filing of the divorce petition the court should continue the action and not terminate it as provided by subsection (7) of KRS 403.150 since the wife anticipated having a baby of a man extrinsic to the subject marital relationship while the husband is in prison goes a long way toward establishing the “irretrievable breakdown” proposition provided for in KRS 403.170 and since this section permits the court to make a determination of whether the evidence shows that the marital relationship between the husband and wife ceased at least ten months prior to the medically expected birth of the child. OAG 76-465.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a paternity judgment of a county is a personal judgment, unless the defendant is personally served in Kentucky in the precise manner indicated in CR 4.04 or unless the defendant enters a voluntary appearance in the action, the judgment would be void for lack of jurisdiction. OAG 77-229.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Essentially a bastardy proceeding is a civil proceeding, and the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure govern. OAG 79-635.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of whether the defendant is the actual father constitutes a condition precedent in judicially applying the remedy set out in KRS 406.011 et seq., i.e., in imposing a financial obligation on the alleged father, defendant.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no explicit provision as relates to subject costs in this chapter. OAG 79-654.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a surrogate parenting contract would be illegal and unenforceable in Kentucky, certain noncontractual remedies exist including a custody proceeding by the natural father under KRS 403.270 or, if the natural father and his wife decided that they did not want custody or to adopt the child, the surrogate mother could institute a paternity action under KRS 406.021, and if the presumption under this section, that the child was born to the natural father and his wife, is overcome, the surrogate mother could have liability for certain expenses imposed upon the father. OAG 81-18.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of contractual provisions between a natural father and a surrogate mother in a surrogate parenting contract providing that the surrogate and her husband agree to assume all risks, including death, incident to the pregnancy and the natural father provides term life insurance and medical insurance for the surrogate, a natural father would not be liable for injuries done to the surrogate mother because of her pregnancy, unless the surrogate establishes his paternity and he becomes liable for the reasonable expense of the surrogate’s pregnancy and confinement under this section.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Uniform Paternity Act vests the county juvenile court with exclusive jurisdiction to determine paternity actions. Sweat v. Turner, 547 S.W.2d 435, 1976 Ky. LEXIS 146 (Ky. 1976).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because jurisdiction over paternity determinations was exclusively with the District Court, the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to render a paternity judgment. Boone v. Ballinger, 228 S.W.3d 1, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 133 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite the fact that KRS 406.021 stated that a paternity complaint may be filed by a “putative father,” the Family Court did not obtain jurisdiction over the alleged father’s petition for custody and support in a case where the alleged father asserted bioloigical father status regarding a child born to a wife of another. Kentucky paternity statutes did not apply where no showing was made that the marital relationship ceased to exist 10 months before the child was born, as set forth in KRS 406.011. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 2008), overruled in part, J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the county attorney did not have the possibility of obtaining a child support order from the putative father’s estate, he lacked standing to bring a paternity action. Commonwealth ex rel. Walker v. Estate of Sullivan, 997 S.W.2d 499, 1999 Ky. App. LEXIS 92 (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the estate of a decedent filed a complaint for determination of paternity of a child allegedly fathered by the decedent, although the Family Court did not have jurisdiction over a paternity action under KRS 406.021 or KRS 406.180, as the estate was not the proper party to file such a suit, and neither the child nor mother ever lived in the United States, the court had jurisdiction under KRS 418.040 to enter a declaratory judgment as to the child’s paternity. Uninsured Employers' Fund v. Bradley, 244 S.W.3d 741, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 403 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When, in a divorce, a trial court entered an order determining a subject child’s paternity, based on an acknowledgment of paternity submitted by the person found to be the child’s father and the child’s mother, and DNA tests subsequently showed this person was not the child’s father, it was error to conclude that the father committed fraud by alleging paternity because (1) the father’s knowledge of a “remote possibility” that the father was not the child’s father was insufficient to show fraud, and (2) any concealment of non-paternity did not bar others involved in a neglect case concerning the child from fully presenting those parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sides of the case, since those parties were not parties to the divorce. Ipock v. Ipock, 403 S.W.3d 580, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 100 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior paternity action is not required to petition the circuit court for custody of a child where father can produce reliable evidence that he is the father and that the best interest of the child would result. Sweat v. Turner, 547 S.W.2d 435, 1976 Ky. LEXIS 146 (Ky. 1976).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the putative father’s paternity action, not under KRS 406.011 because that statute did not define “child born out of wedlock,” but under KRS 406.051 and KRS 406.180 because the putative father’s action was one to determine the paternity of a child whose alleged biological parents were not married to each other as “marriage” was defined under Kentucky law. The putative father himself had standing to file the paternity action because the allegations contained in the putative father’s paternity complaint were sufficient to confer standing on the putative father under KRS 426.021, which allowed putative father’s to file a complaint to determine paternity. J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When, in a divorce, a trial court entered an order determining a subject child’s paternity, based on an acknowledgment of paternity submitted by the person found to be the child’s father and the child’s mother, and DNA tests subsequently showed this person was not the child’s father, it was not error to amend the order because the conclusive paternity tests were a circumstance rendering the order subject to amendment.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prosecutor from one county in a multi-county judicial district could bring an action pursuant to this section to determine the paternity of children from another county in the same judicial district, since paternity actions may be brought by and prosecuted by the mother, child, person or agency substantially contributing to the support of the child, through an attorney of their choosing, with the county attorney only entering the case when requested to do so by the complainant, and because, in this case, the Department for Human Resources contracted with the county attorney to represent the complainant pursuant to KRS 407.190 and subsection (3) of KRS 407.250. Commonwealth ex rel. Stumbo v. Wilson, 622 S.W.2d 912, 1981 Ky. LEXIS 281 (Ky. 1981).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly required genetic testing under KRS 406.081, .091(2) because the man with whom the mother had an affair presented sufficient evidence of access to the mother to make him the child’s father under KRS 406.011; the court properly entered an order of contempt against the mother for refusing to submit to testing because the court gave the mother four opportunities to submit to testing. J. K. v. N.J.A., 397 S.W.3d 916, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The invalidation of KRS 406.031 leaves this commonwealth without a statute of limitations in paternity actions; therefore, as a paternity action is a cause of action created by statute, in the absence of any other time limit fixed by statute, the five-year time limit set out in subdivision (2) of KRS 413.120 shall apply to actions brought pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the county attorney’s duty to prepare the complaint, the clerk’s duty to prepare the summons, and the sheriff’s duty to serve same upon the alleged father, the defendant. OAG 65-472.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment by default may be entered in a proceeding under this chapter. OAG 66-762.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment for child support may be entered in a paternity action, even when a default has been entered against the putative father only after the court hears evidence on which to base an award. OAG 66-762.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is within the discretion of the court in which the paternity action is pending to decline to take the issue of paternity as admitted by default and to require proof on behalf of plaintiff on that issue. OAG 66-762.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court may, if the defendant in the paternity action is within the subpoena power of the court, subpoena him in as a witness at the hearing in spite of his failure to answer the complaint. OAG 66-762.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statutory basis for the county attorney’s getting any fee for his services in filing such an action either before or after the action is begun. OAG 71-90.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The act of filing a paternity action is not discretionary with the county attorney. OAG 71-426.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney may not refuse to file a paternity action on the grounds he thinks it is unfounded if the other conditions of this chapter are met. OAG 71-426.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney is the proper person to initiate paternity actions upon the request of a proper party, but the county attorney is vested with the discretion to not prosecute such an action if he believes there is no chance of success. OAG 74-63.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a paternity judgment of a county is a personal judgment, unless the defendant is personally served in Kentucky in the precise manner indicated in CR 4.04 or unless the defendant enters a voluntary appearance in the action, the judgment would be void for lack of jurisdiction. OAG 77-229.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in this section authorizing the county court to consider paternity cases in juvenile session of county court. OAG 78-104.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a surrogate parenting contract would be illegal and unenforceable in Kentucky, certain noncontractual remedies exist including a custody proceeding by the natural father under KRS 403.270 or, if the natural father and his wife decided that they did not want custody or to adopt the child, the surrogate mother could institute a paternity action under this section, and if the presumption under KRS 406.011, that the child was born to the natural father and his wife, is overcome, the surrogate mother could have liability for certain expenses imposed upon the father.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering this chapter as a whole and noting that this section provides in part that all remedies under KRS Ch. 407 are available for enforcement of duties of support under this chapter, the county court has a continuing jurisdiction over paternity actions for the purposes of the child’s support as well as the future education of the child and thus the court can modify the original judgment as it pertains to the education of the child.

Therefore, if paternity has been established under this chapter and a custody and visitation order had been entered pursuant to that finding, a copy of which is received by the putative father, then KRS 509.070 should be applicable to a father who violates that visitation order.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who knowingly violates a properly established custody and visitation order entered pursuant to this chapter should be subject to prosecution under KRS 509.070; to differentiate between those visitation orders entered under this chapter from those entered under Chapter 403 or other chapters would establish an improper distinction between the children whom these orders cover.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not offend the Equal Protection Clause of 14th Amendment; in summary, it does for the defendant what CR 35.01 formerly did, and still does, for the mother, child and other complainant. When harmonized by being construed together with CR 35.01, this section avoids discrimination and does not create it; together they grant equal rights for the obtaining of blood test evidence to mother, child, and alleged father. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Alternative Method of Test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In paternity actions the necessity for the blood test evidence and its unavailability from another source permit the showing of “good cause” to be routinely made and accordingly, an order under CR 35.01 is virtually as automatically obtainable as one under this section. Since the frequency of use of CR 35.01 is not limited (CR 26.01), additional examinations may be secured under it as under KRS 406.091. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since evidence of equal probative value cannot be obtained from another source and since in a paternity proceeding the characteristics of blood are a physical condition in controversy, the additional requirements of “good cause” and “physical condition<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. . . . .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in controversy” found in CR 35.01 and not in this section do not make them inconsistent procedures” within the meaning of CR 1(2). In these respects this section places no additional burden upon mother and child than was on them before such statute was passed. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instead of being “inconsistent procedures” within the meaning of CR 1(2), CR 35.01 and this section are consistent in that each provides a method for obtaining blood tests from mother, child and alleged father. Blood tests of all three are essential for this evidence in a paternity case to have value. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the general assembly enacted this section in 1964, it had a reasonable basis for finding that existing law in the form of CR 35.01 was inadequate in itself to cover all of the blood-testing situations in paternity proceedings and that it therefore was desirable to supplement it in order to plug any possible gaps; in this section it insured to the defendant the same right to require blood tests of the mother and child as existing law (CR 35.01) granted to them through the county attorney to require of him. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section in providing a method for obtaining blood tests by a defendant, does not purport to preclude mother, child, or other complainant from obtaining them of a defendant by using CR 35.01. To hold otherwise would subject this section to a charge of unlawful discrimination which cannot be assumed the general assembly intended. Perry v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 655, 1983 Ky.

The implication of KRS 406.091(3) was that genetic testing alone was insufficient to establish paternity if the father raised a legally sufficient reason as to why paternity should not be entered against him.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the estate of a decedent filed a complaint for determination of paternity of a child allegedly fathered by the decedent, although the family court did not have jurisdiction over a paternity action under KRS 406.021 or KRS 406.180, as the estate was not the proper party to file such a suit, and neither the child nor mother ever lived in the United States, the court had jurisdiction under KRS 418.040 to enter a declaratory judgment as to the child’s paternity. Uninsured Employers' Fund v. Bradley, 244 S.W.3d 741, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 403 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 406.180 stated that the Kentucky chapter on paternity applied to all cases of birth out of wedlock where the birth occurred in Kentucky, the Family Court did not acquire jurisdiction over the alleged father’s petition for custody and support over the child born to a wife of another. The Kentucky paternity statutes did not apply where no evidence was presented that the child was born within 10 months of the marital relationship ceasing, as set forth in KRS 406.011. J.N.R. v. O'Reilly, 264 S.W.3d 587, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 2008), overruled in part, J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court had jurisdiction under KRS 23A.100(2)(b) over an action to establish paternity to a child that was conceived while a married couple was legally separated and pursuing a divorce; given the unusual facts of this case and the inherent rights of biological parents, the grant of joint custody to appellant former husband could not prevent appellee alleged biological father from pursuing his paternity action under the Uniform Act on Paternity, KRS ch. 406. The family court had jurisdiction to make the proper balancing of the parties’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rights and determine the best interests of the child. Smith v. Garber, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 142 (Ky.), sub. op., 2010 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 115 (Ky. June 17, 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the putative father’s paternity action, not under KRS 406.011 because that statute did not define “child born out of wedlock,” but under KRS 406.051 and KRS 406.180 because the putative father’s action was one to determine the paternity of a child whose alleged biological parents were not married to each other as “marriage” was defined under Kentucky law. The putative father himself had standing to file the paternity action because the allegations contained in the putative father’s paternity complaint were sufficient to confer standing on the putative father under KRS 426.021, which allowed putative father’s to file a complaint to determine paternity. J.A.S. v. Bushelman, 342 S.W.3d 850, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mother was estopped from arguing that KRS 406.180 limited jurisdiction to children born “out of wedlock.” The mother and her husband judicially admitted that another man was the father of a child born during the marriage, and diagnostic testing confirmed the other man’s paternity; the mother’s judicial admissions were sufficient to rebut the presumption that her husband was the father of the child. S.B. v. M.C., 352 S.W.3d 345, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 151 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Genetic Testing Required.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly required genetic testing under KRS 406.081, .091(2) because the man with whom the mother had an affair presented sufficient evidence of access to the mother to make him the child’s father under KRS 406.011; the court properly entered an order of contempt against the mother for refusing to submit to testing because the court gave the mother four opportunities to submit to testing. J. K. v. N.J.A., 397 S.W.3d 916, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

Further, KRS 407.5205(1)(b) did not apply because the parties did not file a written consent for another state to assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of child support. Gibson v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based on the definitions of child support order under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the child support order referred to in the statute would include a temporary support order; there was no question that the decree in this case entered on June 11, 2018 changed child support as it was ordered in the temporary child support order, and thus, it would appear that the trial court’s entry of the supplemental decree on June 11, 2018 was a modification of a child support order.
