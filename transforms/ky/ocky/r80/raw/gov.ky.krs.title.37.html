<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Arbitrator exceeded his powers in modifying an arbitration award where there were no grounds for modification because while the arbitrator determined that the original award was improperly determined, that was not a permitted reason to modify the award per statute, and by the arbitrator exceeding the enumerated statutory powers, a trial court erred in so confirming the modification of the original award. Moreover, while the arbitrator stated that no new evidence was considered, the modification was one that could only have been made by a reconsideration of the evidence, which was not allowed.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plain meaning of this section is that the agreement,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wherever made, must provide for the arbitration itself to be in the Commonwealth<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in order to confer subject matter jurisdiction on a Kentucky court; at that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>point, one looks to Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to order a limited liability company and its sole member to arbitrate their dispute with a seller, owner, and condominium council as described in a “Home Owners Limited Warranty” (HOLW) because the HOLW did not constitute the making of an agreement described in the Act, KRS 417.050, which was a predicate for jurisdiction under KRS 417.200. When the HOLW limited the effect of the member’s signature to a mere acknowledgment of receipt and not an assent to the terms thereof, the parties need not suffer the expense and delay of the arbitration hearing, only to find that the award is unenforceable, and when the issue arises prior to the arbitration hearing, and the agreement upon which arbitration is sought fails to comply with the literal provisions of KRS 417.200, the courts of Kentucky are without jurisdiction to enforce the agreement to arbitrate.

The elements of estoppel were not met where it was clear that a power of attorney given to the patient’s son was limited to criminal charges, there was no language of durability, and preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act was not shown based on KRS 417.200 where subject matter jurisdiction was not an issue in the case.
