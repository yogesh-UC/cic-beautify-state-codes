<p class="p6">The General Assembly finds that activities involving the use and exhibition of farm animals are engaged in by a large number of citizens of Kentucky and that these activities also attract to Kentucky a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Kentucky. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in working with, exhibiting, and using farm animals which should be understood by participants in farm animal activities and which are essentially impossible for owners of farm animals or sponsors of farm animal activities to eliminate, it is the purpose of KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 to define the areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall be responsible, to specify risks of injury for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall not be responsible, and to specify areas of responsibilities of farm animal participants. Therefore, the General Assembly determines that to preserve and promote the long Kentucky tradition of activities involving farm animals and the health and safety of the citizens of Kentucky and visitors to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 are necessary to instruct persons voluntarily engaging in farm animal activities of the potential risks inherent in the activities.</p>

<p class="p6">KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 are intended to aid courts and juries in defining the duties of persons responsible for farm animals to others who have chosen to participate in farm animal activities. KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 also establish the policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that persons do not have a duty to eliminate risks inherent in farm animal activities which are beyond their immediate control if those risks are or should be reasonably obvious, expected, or necessary to participants engaged in farm animal activities. Furthermore, KRS 247.401 to 247.4029 establish the policy that the sponsor, instructor, or other professional engaged in farm animal activities who breaches a duty to a farm animal activity participant and causes foreseeable injury to the participant shall be responsible for the injury in accordance with other applicable law.</p>

Further, while manufacturing methamphetamine required that the defendant acted in the past, proving that the defendant possessed the anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine in the future required proving how the defendant was going to act; thus, the two crimes did not constitute a “continuing course of conduct” and did not violate double jeopardy.

Furthermore, the fact that a manufacturing process was ongoing at the time of the search and that numerous other chemicals and items of equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were found nearby, created a reasonable inference that defendant intended to use the anhydrous ammonia to manufacture methamphetamine.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 250.991(2) refers to an enhanced penalty for a “subsequent offense” without defining it. In that circumstance, the Supreme Court of Kentucky has always interpreted such language to require a conviction-to-offense sequence, i.e., the second offense must occur after conviction of the first offense. The rationale behind this interpretation is that after punishment is imposed for the commission of a crime, the double penalty is held in terrorem over the criminal, for the purpose of effecting his reformation, and preventing further and subsequent offenses by him; the Supreme Court of Kentucky adopts this interpretation for subsequent offenses prosecuted under KRS 250.991(2).

The books and records shall clearly indicate the producer assessment and shall be open for inspection by the board or the department.

If the board receives notification the fund is less than three million dollars ($3,000,000), then the board shall within sixty (60) days reinstate the assessment fee of .0025 times the gross value of the fund-covered grain purchased.

Acts ch. 106, sec. 1, has been changed in codification to the “Kentucky Horse Racing Commission” to reflect the reorganization of certain parts of the Executive Branch, as set forth in Executive Order 2009-535 and confirmed by the General Assembly in 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24. This change was made by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24, sec. 1938.</p>

<p class="p7">(7/15/2010). The proposed Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 398, which became 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106, attached the text of Senate Bill 105/HCS to HB 398 and made several changes to the existing provisions, including the addition of paragraph (c) to subsection (9) of this statute. As drafted, paragraph (c) contained the phrase, “commission authorized under this Act.” After examination of the materials in the bill folder and consultation with the drafter, “this Act” was changed to “this chapter” during codification, as all sections of 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106 are located in KRS Chapter 257. This substitution was made by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(f).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the state imposes a license fee on dogs pursuant to this section, there is nothing under the state dog act prohibiting a city from also imposing a license fee and from regulating dogs. In fact, KRS 258.365 provides, in effect, that nothing under the act shall be construed to prohibit or limit the right of any city to pass or enforce any ordinance regulating dogs, the provisions of which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. OAG 71-160.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section and KRS 258.195, a county dog warden paid by the fiscal court a salary of $1,200 per year is entitled to retain the sum of 25¢ for each dog license issued and, in addition, if he operates the county dog pound at his own expense, he is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses actually so incurred in addition to his salary and the 25¢ fees he is entitled to retain. OAG 73-557.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An operator of a pet store who sells dogs under a permit from a city must also comply with state requirements pertaining to the licensing of dogs by obtaining from the dog warden a license under this section for each dog six (6) months old or over owned or kept by him or he must obtain a kennel license from the dog warden pursuant to former KRS 258.165 (now repealed) for the dogs required to be licensed under this section. OAG 74-699.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The department of agriculture, with the approval of the Governor, could authorize members of 4-H clubs throughout the state to act as agents of the department for the purpose of selling dog licenses and receive for such services a 25¢ fee for each license sold.

<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Upon reclaiming an impounded dog, cat, or ferret, the owner shall show proof of a valid rabies vaccination. If proof of the vaccination cannot be provided, the owner shall purchase a vaccination voucher from the animal shelter. The voucher shall be valid for ten (10) days from the date of issuance and shall be used in the prescribed time period. The animal shelter shall reimburse the veterinarian for the amount of the voucher upon presentation to the shelter by the administering veterinarian.</p>

It was supplemental to, rather than inconsistent with, KRS ch. 258, which banned vicious dogs generally, since it did not limit the statute’s application but instead provided a more comprehensive plan of protection.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The Southern Dairy Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="p5">History</p>
<p class="p6"><b>History.</b> <br>
Enact. Acts 1998, ch. 471, § 1, effective upon contingency.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE I STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND DECLARATION OF POLICY</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Section 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy.</p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.</p>
<p class="p6">The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.</p>
<p class="p6">The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the region’s rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.</p>
<p class="p6">By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.</p>
<p class="p6">Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.</p>
<p class="p6">In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual, state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="p6">In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.</p>
<p class="p6">Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal orders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION</b></p>
<p class="p6">Section 2. Definitions.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> “Compact” means this interstate compact.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> “Compact over-order price” means a minimum price required to be paid to producers for Class I milk established by the commission in regulations adopted pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of this compact, which is above the price established in federal marketing orders or by state farm price regulation in the regulated area.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> This compact shall be construed liberally in order to achieve the purposes and intent enunciated in Section 1 of this compact. It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation, and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are associated with market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined in this compact, but the commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>ARTICLE III COMMISSION ESTABLISHED</b></p>

<p class="p6">The purpose of a soil and water conservation district is to conserve and develop all renewable natural resources within the district. In so doing, the district is authorized to undertake, sponsor, or participate in projects and activities which promote the conservation, development, maintenance and use of the land, water, trees and other renewable natural resources of the district. Such projects and activities shall include but not be limited to conservation practices on agricultural lands, the control of soil erosion, retardation of water runoff, the construction of flood prevention and control reservoirs, the maintenance of flood plains, the promotion of projects to assure an adequate municipal, industrial and agricultural supply of water, watershed stabilization, the avoidance and abatement of sedimentation and pollution in streams and other bodies of water, forestation and reforestation, the establishment of parks and outdoor recreation areas, the protection of open space, greenbelt areas and scenery, the preservation of wilderness areas, the protection of fish and wildlife, working for the location of highways, industries, housing developments, airports and other structures as are consistent with the district’s objectives and will offer the least possible interference with the conservation and best multiple use of the renewable natural resources, and all other activities consistent with the total natural resources development of the district.</p>
