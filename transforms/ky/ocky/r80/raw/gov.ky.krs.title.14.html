The agreements shall specify the rights, duties, and obligations of both the local public library, or other governing body, and the department. The department shall promulgate administrative regulations to establish the application process, criteria for selecting projects for assistance, a minimum level of local participation, and the process to be followed in the construction of facilities. The department shall report assistance awards to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue within thirty (30) days of execution of any memorandum of agreement.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The salary payment of not less than $50.00 nor more than $100 per month for a librarian is mandatory. OAG 67-369.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Circuit Court Clerk as ex officio librarian of the county law library can receive the salary stipulated in this section in addition to his compensation as clerk which cannot exceed $15,667.20 per annum. OAG 75-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The circuit clerk is ex officio the librarian of the county law library, his duties as librarian may not be delegated to an outsider but may be performed by a regular deputy circuit clerk, and his salary as librarian is official income and must be counted as a part of his fees in considering his maximum statutory compensation. OAG 75-573.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On and after January 2, 1978, the law librarian’s salary will have to be paid out of the county treasury, and if the librarian’s salary, when considered as a part of the circuit clerk’s total compensation, exceeds the rubber dollar maximum for circuit clerks, the excess money will have to be turned over to the Department for Finance and Administration (now Finance and Administration Cabinet). OAG 77-270.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The consumer price index formula adjustment of the circuit clerk’s compensation is only applied against the monetary level set forth in the state Constitution and does not operate on any statutory fees, salaries or statutory limits.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plan whereby a county law library would be housed in a university library 300 yards from the county courthouse, where the Circuit Court Clerk would receive new books, keep records of books received, take inventory, and deliver books to the library to be stored in the reference section to be available to all, but checked out only by officials and attorneys, is in substantial compliance with this section. OAG 79-270.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The duties of the county law librarian generally cannot be delegated to others, however, since under KRS 61.035 a deputy clerk may perform any act permitted to be done by the principal ministerial officer, the circuit clerk may designate one or more of his deputy clerks to assist in the librarian function, where necessary. OAG 80-423.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the circuit clerk has the positive duty to serve as the county law librarian, he is implicitly required to provide any personnel necessary to assist him in performing properly the function of county law librarian; this statutory responsibility really falls on the office of circuit clerk, regardless of who is clerk and thus the office staff (the clerk through use of his deputies) are held responsible for the librarian function. OAG 80-517.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The librarian’s salary is not subject to indexing under the Consumer Price Index, since this section makes no provisions for indexing. OAG 82-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The payment of the librarian’s salary is mandatory since this section says “shall receive.” OAG 82-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no constitutional problem with subsection (1) of this section, which makes the circuit clerk the ex officio law librarian, except that the county law librarian function must not interfere with the clerk’s court functions as envisioned in Const., § 114 and KRS 30A.010; the circuit clerk is entitled to receive a salary from the county treasury, as a properly budgeted item under KRS Ch. 68, for actually serving as the ex officio librarian of the county law library and the salary provisions of KRS 64.055 (repealed) relate solely to the work of the clerk as Circuit and District Court Clerk. OAG 82-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where two successive circuit clerks performed the duties of county law librarian without compensation, the fiscal court might be required by a court to make up those payments, under the salary established pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, but within the five-year statute of limitation, pursuant to KRS 413.120(2). OAG 82-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the maximum salary, as set forth in Const., § 246 and indexed under the consumer price index concept, must apply to the same person for public services, regardless of whether such services are rendered in one position or more than one, the circuit clerk can accept the salary as law librarian, provided that the regular clerk’s salary and the library salary in the aggregate do not exceed the rubber dollar maximum for the particular year. OAG 82-177.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The monthly salary of the clerk as ex officio librarian must be fixed by the fiscal court, payable out of the county treasury. OAG 83-75.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The compensation for the librarian function, when added to what the circuit clerk receives as circuit clerk, cannot exceed the rubber dollar limit for each particular year. OAG 83-75.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Salary paid to a Circuit Court clerk by a county fiscal court, for such officer’s services as ex officio county law librarian, cannot be lawfully credited in relation to a clerk’s Kentucky Employees Retirement System account, as such salary is not “creditable compensation” within that system.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit Court Clerk, as a part-time worker as ex officio county law librarian, was not eligible to have the salary for part-time work credited in relation to the County Employees Retirement System (CERS). OAG 94-45.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payment to the Circuit Court Clerk for part-time work as ex officio county law librarian did not constitute “creditable compensation” within the meaning of applicable statutes; moreover, there is no provision authorizing purchase of credit for part-time service as ex officio county law librarian.

The rent received in any year from any real property belonging to the board of trustees shall be first applied to the payment of interest on bonds for such year, and next to the sinking fund requirements of the bond issue for such year, and the balance may be used for current operating expenses of the board of trustees.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The fiscal court of any county containing a population of over two hundred thousand (200,000) and a city of the first class, may contract with the board of trustees of the free public library of any such city for the purpose of granting to the residents and schools of such county the same privileges afforded by such library to residents and schools in the city.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Notwithstanding any provisions of Kentucky Revised Statutes to the contrary, when the fiscal court of any county containing a population of over two hundred thousand (200,000) and a city of the first class have in effect a compact under KRS 79.310 to 79.330, the city and county shall by joint action create a joint city/county department for the purpose of providing a free public library. In such event, the board of trustees shall be dissolved as a corporate entity, and all assets and liabilities of the board of trustees shall be transferred to the joint department. An advisory board may be established by joint agreement of such city and county. Upon the establishment of a consolidated local government in a county where a city of the first class and a county containing that city have had in effect a cooperative compact pursuant to KRS 79.310 to 79.330, the joint department shall become a department of the consolidated local government and all assets and liabilities of the joint department shall be transferred to the consolidated local government.

<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The county judge/executive shall make the appointments authorized by subsection (3) of this section in the following manner. On March 31 of 1978 and March 31 of 1980, he or she shall appoint persons to fill two (2) of the vacancies which occur. On March 31 of 1979 and March 31 of 1981, he or she shall appoint a person to fill one (1) vacancy which occurs. He or she shall continue to make the appointments to these positions when a vacancy occurs or a term expires, subject to subsection (5) of this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> If the contract between the fiscal court and a free public library terminates or ceases to be in effect, the county judge/executive shall no longer have the authority to appoint persons as trustees to the board of the free public library and the mayor may terminate the appointment of trustees appointed by the county judge/executive and appoint persons to fill their unexpired terms.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where libraries were established under this section, prior to the 1965 rollback legislation, the city or county which established such libraries must reduce its respective library tax to the applicable compensating tax rate, or restricted budget, regardless of whether that rate or revenue would be less than five cents on the hundred. OAG 69-590.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Attorney General Opinions 68-84 and 70-327 may be distinguished although both are construing subsection (2) of this section, as the voters of Barren County in 1954 voted to establish not only a library service but also a concomitant tax levy which should be made in addition to the regular county general tax levy, while the 1956 Allen County vote was only an acknowledgment of the voters’ desire for library services so that any library appropriation must necessarily come out of the general county tax levy.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The revenue sharing fund belonging to the city and county may be spent for the categories selected by the board, as necessity demands. OAG 73-400.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the library was created under this section or KRS 173.450, it would come within the term “other municipality” of Const., § 165, a member of the board of trustees would be a municipal officer, and under KRS 61.260 (repealed), there would be a conflict of interest if a law firm accepted employment from the library board where a member of the law firm was a member of the library board of trustees when the contract was made and such member might receive benefit as a result of the contract.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The management and control of a library shall be vested in a board of trustees. In cities and counties, the board shall consist of five (5) members except that in cities with populations equal to or greater than twenty thousand (20,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census, it shall consist of seven (7) members. In the event a contract for library service is made pursuant to subsection (4) of KRS 173.310, the board may consist of equal representation from the contracting parties with the total membership not to exceed twelve (12).

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Within thirty (30) days after the establishment of a library has been authorized by any of the methods authorized by KRS 173.310, a library board shall be appointed. In cities the trustees shall be appointed by the mayor and in counties they shall be appointed by the county judge/executive. There shall be established a board of trustees in each regional library district for purposes of coordinating library programs and effecting economies and efficiencies of the member county library systems. In each regional library district, the trustees shall be appointed by the joint action of the judges/executive of the respective counties or as may be agreed upon by contract. In any region in which there are four (4) or less counties, provision shall be made in the contract for rotation of members and an equitable adjustment of terms. If a region consists of an even number of counties, the trustees appointed by the judges/executive of the respective counties shall appoint an additional trustee whose term of office shall be four (4) years and whose successor shall be appointed by the trustees in office at the time of expiration of such term. Trustees shall be appointed from the governmental unit at large with special reference to their fitness for such office. Upon initial establishment of the board, members of the board shall be appointed to terms as follows: two (2) members for two (2) years, one (1) member for three (3) years, and two (2) members for four (4) years respectively, and thereafter trustees shall be appointed to serve terms of four (4) years. Trustees may serve for two (2) consecutive terms after which they shall not succeed themselves. They may be reappointed no earlier than twelve (12) months following the end of their last service. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms as soon as possible in the same manner as the original appointments. In the event that vacancies have existed for a period of at least six (6) months, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, upon the recommendation of the state librarian, may make such necessary appointments. After absence of a trustee from four (4) regular monthly meetings of the board during any one (1) year of the trustee’s term, the trustee shall be considered to have automatically resigned from the board. An advisory board may be appointed and serve as specified in bylaws of the public library board of trustees.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Library trustees shall not receive a salary or other compensation for their services, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties, upon approval by the board. Before entering upon the duties of his office, a trustee shall take oath that he will faithfully discharge his duties. No board shall employ as a member of its library staff any member of the board or any person related closer than a second cousin to any member of the board. No person is eligible to this office who is directly or indirectly interested in the sale to the library of books, magazines, supplies, equipment, materials, insurance or services for which library funds are expended.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> After the legislative body of a governmental unit has made provisions for library service according to any of the methods set forth in KRS 173.310, the legislative body shall appropriate money annually to furnish such service. In library regions it shall not be less than three cents ($0.03), nor more than ten cents ($0.10) on each one hundred dollars ($100) worth of property assessed for local taxation. In counties containing a city of the first class it shall be not more than fifteen cents ($0.15) on each one hundred dollars ($100) worth of property assessed for local taxation. In all other governmental units it shall be not less than five cents ($0.05) nor more than fifteen cents ($0.15) on each one hundred dollars ($100) worth of property assessed for local taxation. In those instances where county library service has been established on the initiative of the fiscal court and when an appropriation of less than the minimum amount required by this subsection is proposed, the minimum amount of support for county library service may be determined annually through a mutual agreement of the county library board, the county fiscal court, and the state Department for Libraries and Archives. This agreement shall be reflected in the records of the legislative body of the governmental unit making the appropriation.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> All funds for the library shall be deposited monthly to the credit of the library board. These funds shall not be used for any but library purposes. The treasurer of the library board shall be required to execute bond with good and sufficient surety thereon for the faithful performance of his duties, the amount of the bond to be fixed by the board. If the bond has a corporate surety the premium shall be paid from the library fund. The board shall have exclusive control of expenditures, subject to an examination of accounts as may be required by the legislative body, and money shall be paid only upon vouchers approved by the board. The board shall not make expenditures or incur indebtedness in any year in excess of the amount of money appropriated and available for library purposes, except where a library board is the owner of real estate not used for library purposes, in which case they may borrow money secured solely by that property. Principal and interest on indebtedness on real estate owned by a library board not used for library purposes is not chargeable to the library funds derived from taxation.</p>

OAG 68-259.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A library created under KRS 173.310 is not a separate taxing district. The library tax must be included in the city’s general tax levy and the city’s legislative body establishes the library tax, under this section, at a rate which cannot be lower than five cents, subject to the rollback provisions of KRS 132.027. OAG 68-320.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county fiscal court is mandatorily required to levy a tax of not less than five cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for taxation by the county, for the county library. OAG 70-327.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a library district has been established under KRS 173.310, the fiscal court is required to appropriate money annually to furnish such library service, and the amount shall be not less than five cents nor more than 15 cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for local taxation, subject to the limitations of KRS 68.245. OAG 70-706.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After a library is established, the legislative body may appropriate moneys from the general tax revenues or the question of a tax rate may be submitted to the voters as a special levy in addition to the existing property tax; thus, where it appeared that a city had made an appropriation, the appropriation had to come from the general tax revenues of the city.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The entire principal indebtedness would govern and not the amount of principal to be paid each year in measuring an obligation of the library district against the requirements of Ky. Const., § 157. OAG 71-34.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a proposed library building would exceed the debt limitations of the library district, a holding company could be used to borrow the necessary funds and lease the library building to the library district. OAG 71-34.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The members of the fiscal court would not be liable for the nonexpenditure of library funds collected and turned over to the library board under subsection (4) (now (2)) of KRS 173.720, because the library board and its treasurer, and not the members of the fiscal court, are responsible for the expenditure of funds in accordance with this section and KRS 173.755. OAG 81-257.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reading KRS 173.725 and this section in pari materia it must be concluded that KRS 173.725 implicitly provides that library district board members must, as a minimal qualification, be willing to accept the mandates of this section as to doing all things necessary to provide efficient library service. OAG 82-202.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A library district can qualify to issue revenue bonds under KRS Ch. 58, since it is a special taxing district under Ky. Const., § 157 and is a “governmental agency” under KRS 58.010(3); if it issues revenue bonds for a proposed project, the library district board can exercise the power to condemn real estate pursuant to KRS 58.140. However, a library district which planned to use mortgage financing for library improvements had no power to condemn the real estate needed. OAG 82-343.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 173.520(1) and subsection (1) of this section provide that the library district board shall “do all things necessary to provide efficient library service,” that language does not standing alone grant the power of condemnation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the literal provisions of subdivision (2)(b) of this section, the library board’s authority to borrow money for the district operation is clearly limited to the anticipation of the revenue to be derived form taxes levied by the district for the fiscal year in which the money is borrowed; thus, the board could not borrow money in March of 1984 as a loan against tax revenues to be received during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1984.
