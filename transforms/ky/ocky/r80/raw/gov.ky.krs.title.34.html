<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">If the title to any property to which KRS 391.210 to 391.260 applies was held by the decedent at the time of death, title of the surviving spouse may be perfected by an order of the probate court or by execution of an instrument by the personal representative or the heirs or devisees of the decedent with the approval of the probate court. Neither the personal representative nor the court in which the decedent’s estate is being administered has a duty to discover or attempt to discover whether property held by the decedent is property to which KRS 391.210 to 391.260 applies, unless a written demand is made by the surviving spouse or the spouse’s successor in interest.</p>

<p class="p6">If a surviving spouse has apparent title to property to which KRS 391.210 to 391.260 applies, a purchaser for value or a lender taking a security interest in the property takes his interest in the property free of any rights of the personal representative or an heir or devisee of the decedent.

A purchaser for value or a lender need not inquire whether a vendor or borrower acted properly. The proceeds of a sale or creation of a security interest shall be treated in the same manner as the property transferred to the purchaser for value or a lender.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> A “multiple-party account” is any of the following types of account: (i) a joint account, (ii) a P.O.D. account, or (iii) a trust account. It does not include accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture, or other association for business purposes, or accounts controlled by one (1) or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, charitable or civic organization or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> “Net contribution” of a party to a joint account as of any given time is the sum of all deposits thereto made by or for him, less all withdrawals made by or for him which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. The term includes, in addition, any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> “Party” means a person who, by the terms of the account, has subject to request, a present right, exercisable alone or jointly with one (1) or more other parties, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to him by reason of his surviving the original payee or trustee. Unless the context otherwise requires, it includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative, or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. It also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account for another whether or not a beneficiary is named, but it does not include any named beneficiary unless he has a present right of withdrawal;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(13)</b> “Sums on deposit” means the balance payable on a multiple-party account including interest, dividends, and in addition any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party;</p>

A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust or a trust agreement which has significance apart from the account, or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relation such as attorney-client;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(15)</b> “Withdrawal” includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party;</p>

If there are two or more surviving parties their respective ownerships during lifetime shall be in proportion to their previous ownership interests under KRS 391.310 augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before his death; and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.</p>

The transfer or release of those joint account funds has no bearing on the actual rights of ownership of the funds as between the surviving party or parties to the account and the dower or curtesy interest of any surviving spouse. The transfer or release by a financial institution or third party in accordance with this section shall constitute a full release and discharge of the financial institution or third party from all claims relating to ownership.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If the account is a P.O.D. account, on death of the original payee or of the survivor of two or more original payees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the original payee; if two or more P.O.D. payees survive, there is no right of survivorship in event of death of a P.O.D. payee thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If the account is a trust account, on death of the trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the trustee, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent; if two or more beneficiaries survive, there is no right of survivorship in event of death of any beneficiary thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> In other cases, the death of any party to a multiple-party account has no effect on beneficial ownership of the account other than to transfer the rights of the decedent as part of his estate.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> A right of survivorship arising from the express terms of the account or under this section, a beneficiary designation in a trust account, or a P.O.D. payee designation, cannot be changed by will.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The interest of a widow can be neither increased nor diminished by the will and a widow who renounces the will of her deceased husband has no right to have land, directed by the will to be sold and the proceeds of the sale distributed, treated as personalty, and distributed. Barnett's Adm'r v. Barnett's Adm'r, 58 Ky. 254, 1858 Ky. LEXIS 45 (Ky. 1858) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A widow is not entitled to her dower rights unless she renounces her deceased husband’s will even though the amount she would receive under the will would not be equal to the value of her dower and distributable share.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a widow renounces her husband’s will she is in the same position as if the will had never been executed and probated and she cannot appeal from an order probating the will having no further interest in the will.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the condition of the deceased husband’s estate is such that the widow cannot make an intelligent choice as to whether to take under the will or to renounce its provisions, the chancellor should postpone the election to such time as will permit her to make an intelligent choice, even beyond the 12-month (now six-month) period.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court did not err in allowing widow an extension of time within which to elect whether she would take under her husband’s will since she was a party defendant in a suit asking for settlement of her husband’s estate and the condition of estate was such that an intelligent choice could not be made within the prescribed time. Brewer's Ex'r v. Smith, 242 Ky. 175, 45 S.W.2d 1036, 1932 Ky. LEXIS 234 (Ky. 1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A widow’s failure to renounce will within 12-month (now six-month) statutory period after probation was equivalent to a declaration of election to take under the will and was as binding as a renunciation would have been, if made.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a husband failed to make a timely renunciation of a decedent’s will in the manner required by KRS 392.080(1), the Circuit Court correctly ruled that the husband’s claim to a surviving spouse’s elective share of the decedent’s estate was barred.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Unclaimed sums delivered to the Kentucky State Treasurer pursuant to KRS 393.080(3) shall be placed in a special expendable trust fund established by the Kentucky Workers’ Compensation Funding Commission. The Kentucky Workers’ Compensation Funding Commission shall establish a separate trust account with respect to each final determination or order providing for a refund that the Attorney General determines to have a reasonable relationship to the workers’ compensation liability of a bankrupt employer.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims shall be the administrator of the resulting trust fund established pursuant to this section. The commissioner or his or her designee shall be authorized to determine the value of all workers’ compensation claims against the bankrupt employer and to prepare a comprehensive distribution plan. Eligible claimants may elect to participate in a comprehensive distribution plan in exchange for the release of all related claims against the Commonwealth and all of its cabinets, departments, offices, bureaus, agencies, officers, agents, and employees, with the exception of the special fund in the Labor Cabinet. A claimant shall agree as part of a release under this section not to file any future motions to reopen the named workers’ compensation claim or claims, and not to file new claims with respect to the same injury or occupational disease.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> A comprehensive distribution plan for unclaimed utility refunds placed in a trust account pursuant to this section shall consist of the full payment of workers’ compensation income benefits for eligible claimants until the fund is exhausted, subject to the exceptions noted in KRS 393.080 and this section, and may include lump-sum settlements in addition to biweekly payment plans. An initial distribution shall be made to eligible claimants after the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims, or the commissioner’s designee, has made an initial determination of the number of eligible claimants, the amount of income benefits due, and the amount to be retained as a reserve for pending claims. The initial distribution shall include payment of all past due income benefits, without interest, for eligible claimants.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Neither the special fund nor the uninsured employers’ fund shall be considered to be claimants for the purposes of this section. Medical and related benefits shall not be considered in the valuation of the claims unless the amount available in the trust fund clearly exceeds the estimated value of income benefits for all claims. If a workers’ compensation surety bond, letter of credit, or other form of security for the payment of the workers’ compensation liabilities of a bankrupt employer has been collected by the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims or the Workers’ Compensation Board for distribution to claimants in a manner to be determined by court order, it may be assumed in the valuation of the claims in a comprehensive distribution plan that the security will be distributed by the court on a pro rata basis and an appropriate deduction may be taken.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> In preparing the valuation of claims for inclusion in a comprehensive distribution plan, the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee shall deduct special fund payments. Settlement of a workers’ compensation claim as part of a comprehensive distribution plan under this section shall not accelerate the date on which the special fund’s liability becomes due.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If the bankrupt employer ceased business operations at least three (3) years prior to establishment of a trust account pursuant to this section, only claimants who file workers’ compensation claims within sixty (60) days of the establishment of the trust account or before shall be eligible to receive payments from the trust fund.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> All claimants shall cooperate with information requests from the Department of Workers’ Claims concerning prior payments of workers’ compensation benefits. The commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims or his or her designee may subpoena witnesses, including present or past managers and officers of the bankrupt employer, and may conduct evidentiary hearings under oath relating to the past and present workers’ compensation liabilities of the bankrupt employer or information relevant to unpaid workers’ compensation benefits. Administrative subpoenas issued under the authority of the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims for this purpose may be enforced in the Franklin Circuit Court.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> The Attorney General shall provide representation of the comprehensive distribution plan as a named defendant in the event the establishment of the trust fund is challenged.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> The provisions of KRS 393.080(3) or this section shall not be construed to constitute an admission of the validity of any workers’ compensation claims, nor shall these provisions be interpreted in a manner that would transfer or create liability on behalf of the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims, any agency, or employee, beyond that expressly set forth in a comprehensive distribution plan.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(10)</b> The special fund shall issue trust fund checks in the amounts and to the claimants or claimants’ representatives as directed by the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(11)</b> The personnel and other costs of administering a trust fund established pursuant to this section shall be paid out of the investment income of the trust fund.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(12)</b> Attorney fees shall be subject to the limitations and maximum amounts for the payment of attorney’s fees established by KRS 342.320, as well as the approval of the commissioner or his or her designee.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(13)</b> If a workers’ compensation claimant elects not to participate in a comprehensive distribution plan proposed by the commissioner of the Department of Workers’ Claims or the commissioner’s designee, that claimant shall not be entitled to any portion of the utility refund for the payment of the workers’ compensation benefits. A claimant shall have sixty (60) days following issuance of a comprehensive distribution plan in which to make an election to participate or not.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There must be, in addition to the act of revocation, the intent to revoke, and both must concur in order for there to be legal revocation of a will. Sanders' Adm'r v. Babbitt, 106 Ky. 646, 51 S.W. 163 (Ky. 1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that the wife, who was the sole devisee, told the testator that his will had been destroyed, and thereby prevented him from destroying the same as was his desire, is not sufficient to show a revocation of the will.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because KRS 394.090 governed the revocation of wills at the time the decedent executed his will and remarried, and that statute unambiguously provided that marriage revoked the will, the fact that the statute was revised in 1998 did not change the result; hence, as the decedent never revived that will which had been revoked by operation of law, said will was void.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where original will created trust in specified amounts for brothers of testatrix, with remainder to niece, codicil enlarging amounts to be held in trust for brothers did not have effect of revoking remainder provision of original will, although remaining clause was not repeated in codicil.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the testator’s remarriage to the former spouse.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Upon the sworn application of any fiduciary, that the fiduciary is the sole beneficiary of any estate, the court may dispense with the requirements of this chapter regarding periodic or final settlement of fiduciaries’ accounts and may dispense with the requirements of a surety for the fiduciary and shall accept from the fiduciary an informal settlement. The informal settlement shall be made, under oath, by the fiduciary and shall state that the estate was solvent; that all legal claims and debts have been paid, or if not paid, the manner in which the claims and debts have been provided for; that, for final settlement, the requirements of the inheritance, estate or similar death statutes have been met and the tax paid, if due and payable; that all court costs have been paid; the name of the attorney(s), if any, representing the fiduciary, and the amount of the attorney’s fee, and that the beneficiary has received his or her share. An informal settlement may be filed at any time after expiration of six (6) months from the fiduciary’s appointment. Upon the filing of the informal final settlement, the court may enter an order discharging the fiduciary, and his or her surety, if any. When a settlement is effected in the informal manner, no notice to any person shall be required nor shall the court be compelled to inquire into detailed items of income or disbursements.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If a proposed periodic or final settlement of a fiduciary is accompanied by a verified waiver executed by all of the beneficiaries of an estate, and none of the beneficiaries is under a disability, the court shall accept from the fiduciary an informal settlement which meets the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. Said beneficiaries may request an accounting of the assets of the estate prior to execution of the waiver. No verified waiver need be obtained from a nonresiduary legatee who has received and receipted for his or her legacy, the canceled check or signed receipt attached to the proposed settlement being sufficient evidence of satisfaction. The court may require the fiduciary to execute bond with or without surety to insure the application of the estate assets to the debts of the decedent.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> In the event that one (1) or more of the beneficiaries of the estate is under a disability, the court may allow the filing of an informal settlement if the court is of the opinion that the best interests of the person under the disability would be served.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Niece argued that heirs’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>claims were time-barred under KRS 396.011 because they were not brought within six months; however, the time provisions of that statute apply only to claims that arose before the death of the decedent, and in this case, the claim did not arise until the sister died, and thus the statute was inapplicable. Hoskins v. Beatty, 343 S.W.3d 639, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 165 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Letter from an attorney who was a decedent’s ex-son-in-law was a proper notice of disallowance because it clearly and unequivocally disputed, rejected, and disallowed a claim brought by the decedent’s former spouse, and because it substantially complied with KRS 396.055(1), as the attorney was acting as an agent on the behalf of the estate’s personal representative. However, the former spouse’s claim was not barred because the notice of disallowance failed to include the warning language mandated by KRS 396.055(1), and because the former spouse filed her petition in the circuit court within a reasonable time. Blackwell v. Blackwell, 372 S.W.3d 874, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 114 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action filed against the personal representative of an estate under KRS 396.055 disputing the disallowance of a claim is timely filed if brought within the original six-month presentation period set forth in KRS 396.011(1). Blackwell v. Blackwell, 372 S.W.3d 874, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 114 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the mother of a disabled child sued the estate of the child’s father regarding various statutory violations in the handling of the estate which allegedly resulted in denying the child the opportunity to present a child support claim against the estate, the time limitations in KRS 396.011 for filing a claim against an estate did not apply because those limitations only applied when probate was properly filed. Thompson v. Porter, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 248 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2012), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2013 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 418 (Ky. Ct. App. May 24, 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in affirming a circuit court’s dismissal of a creditor’s claim against a decedent’s heirs because the creditor was a creditor of the decedent and his estate where he filed his tort action prior to the decedent’s death, timely revived the action against the estate administrator, proceeded to obtain a judgment in that action, and filed a judgment lien, which established his status as a creditor of the decedent’s estate and entitlement to a remedy. Gregory v. Hardgrove, 562 S.W.3d 911, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 523 (Ky. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> As to claims presented in the manner described in KRS 396.015 within the time limit prescribed in KRS 396.011, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been allowed or disallowed. If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes his decision concerning the claim, he shall notify the claimant. The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to commence an action on the claim has run and the claim has been barred. Every claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant commences an action against the personal representative not later than sixty (60) days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar. Failure of the personal representative to mail notice to a claimant of action on his claim for sixty (60) days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance, except that upon petition of the personal representative and upon notice to the claimant, the court at any time before payment of such claim may for cause shown permit the personal representative to disallow such claim.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Letter from an attorney who was a decedent’s ex-son-in-law was a proper notice of disallowance because it clearly and unequivocally disputed, rejected, and disallowed a claim brought by the decedent’s former spouse, and because it substantially complied with KRS 396.055(1), as the attorney was acting as an agent on the behalf of the estate’s personal representative. However, the former spouse’s claim was not barred because the notice of disallowance failed to include the warning language mandated by KRS 396.055(1), and because the former spouse filed her petition in the circuit court within a reasonable time.
