<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The Department for Local Government shall examine each capital project selected by the area development districts, and when it finds that a proposed project conforms to the requirements of KRS 42.350 to 42.370; that the estimated costs of the project are reasonable; that the costs proposed to be paid from the fund are within the amount available; and that the proposed beneficiary agency will be reasonably able to finance the operation and maintain the capital project during its estimated useful life, the commissioner of the Department for Local Government shall approve it. If the Department for Local Government determines that a capital project proposal does not conform to the requirements of KRS 42.350 to 42.370, that the estimated costs of the project are excessive or unreasonable in light of the public benefit to be derived from the project, or the unencumbered balance in the fund available for expenditure in the area development district is insufficient to pay the costs of the project, or the part thereof proposed to be paid out of the fund, or the beneficiary agency cannot reasonably finance the operation of or maintain the capital project during its estimated useful life, the project proposal shall be disapproved by the Department for Local Government. The final decision to either approve or disapprove any project proposal shall be made no later than forty-five (45) days following official submittal of a complete proposal by the area development district, and the area development district shall be accordingly notified at that time.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The commissioner of the Department for Local Government may make direct grants-in-aid of money out of the fund to any beneficiary agency for the construction or acquisition of any approved capital project. When a direct grant-in-aid has been made to a beneficiary agency, all contracts awarded for the purchase of materials, supplies, equipment, or services, except professional and technical services, required for the construction or acquisition of the project shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder in the discretion of the beneficiary agency after public advertisement as required by KRS Chapter 424 or other applicable law. All contracts awarded under this section for the construction, reconstruction, or renovation of a building or other improvement to real estate shall be deemed contracts for public works within the meaning of KRS 341.317 and KRS Chapter 376 and other applicable statutes. All beneficiary agencies receiving a direct grant-in-aid under this subsection shall keep and maintain complete and accurate records of accounts of all expenditures of the grant moneys which shall be subject to audit by the Commonwealth for a period of five (5) years after completion of the capital project. Beneficiary agencies shall complete approved capital projects within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Department for Local Government. Upon completion of capital projects, beneficiary agencies shall submit project completion reports to the Department for Local Government as prescribed by the Department for Local Government and containing documents and information as may be necessary to determine compliance with KRS 42.350 to 42.360 and other applicable statutes and administrative regulations. Beneficiary agencies shall be liable to repay to the fund any granted funds for failure to submit full project completion reports within a reasonable period of time or for expenditure of granted funds in violation of statutes and regulations. No additional area development funds may be approved until compliance, except at the discretion of the commissioner of the Department for Local Government. Any grant moneys not required after all of the costs of the capital project have been paid by the beneficiary agency shall be promptly returned to the Commonwealth for reallocation for expenditure for other capital projects in the area development district to which the funds had been originally allocated.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> No capital project shall be constructed under KRS 42.350 to 42.370 except upon land to which (a) the Commonwealth, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, or the beneficiary agency of the capital project has a good and marketable title, free of encumbrances, or (b) the beneficiary agency of the project has the right to the uninterrupted use, occupancy, and possession for a period longer than the estimated useful life of the capital project; provided nothing herein shall prohibit the construction or renovation of public buildings on land with an existing encumbrance to secure payment of funds obtained for the acquisition or improvement of said land. Each beneficiary agency shall execute and deliver to the Commonwealth its written assurances, which shall be binding on the agencies’ successors and assigns, guaranteeing that during its estimated useful life, the capital project shall be operated and maintained for public purposes and pledging that no mortgage or other encumbrances shall be placed against any capital project wholly financed out of the fund, except industrial development projects, for the breach of which assurances the Commonwealth shall have right of entry to the capital project and the beneficiary agency, or its successors and assigns, shall forthwith convey the title to the capital project to the Commonwealth. Similar assurances shall be executed and delivered to the Commonwealth by the beneficiary agencies of capital projects financed in part out of the fund and in part from other sources, except that when additional funding is derived from the issuance and sale of revenue bonds or under other statutorily authorized financing methods, to secure the repayment of which funds a statutory mortgage lien is granted in favor of any person or group of persons, the capital project may be encumbered to the extent authorized or required by the law under which the financing method was undertaken; nor shall anything in this section prohibit the encumbrance of any real property located within an industrial park or constituting an industrial site, developed or improved as a capital project under KRS 42.350 and this section, by any person, firm, company, partnership, or corporation to which the property has been conveyed, to obtain financing for the construction upon the property of industrial and commercial buildings. The written assurances provided by beneficiary agencies under this section shall be lodged for recording and recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the proposed project shall be located.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a county receiving moneys from the Economic Assistance Fund established under KRS 42.450 would appear to have statutory authorization to make expenditures from the fund to such nonprofit organizations as little league baseball pursuant to the language of subsection (2) of this section and 67.083(3)(f) which allow expenditures for “recreation”, such an appropriation would violate the prohibition of Ky. Const., § 179 against appropriations for corporations since the baseball program is not a county operation or function and is not under the basic operative control or management of the fiscal court. OAG 81-381.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Future receipts of county coal severance funds could not be obligated by a fiscal court beyond its present term of office for the future construction of a high school pursuant to subsection (1)(f) of this section; a fiscal court cannot, due to the restrictions of Ky.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court in a county affected by the local government economic assistance program has no authority to enact an ordinance requiring all coal transporters to file the form TD 59-100 (Coal Severor and/or Route and Tonnage Report) with the transportation cabinet, or an ordinance requiring similar reports to be filed with the fiscal court. There is no statute expressly granting counties the authority to enact ordinances in this kind of situation, neither is there any necessary implication of such authority; moreover, the nature of the state legislation is such that it can be seen clearly as a state-preempted financial program of assistance to local governments.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Investment Commission may, under the implied authority of this section, upon the establishment of a basic policy (voted on by a majority of the commission) to be applied under the specific major categories of investment permitted in the statute, have the legal authority to delegate the day-to-day administration of investments to a qualified committee or employee of state government, and by such a policy under the statute, the commission would not thereby be delegating its basic power of discretion or judgment, since by the established policy it would be specifically retaining its discretionary authority.

OAG 82-29.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Purchases under subsection (2) of KRS 41.380 (now subsection (8) of this section) may include “repurchase agreements,” involving United States Treasury Bills which would involve the state’s purchase of the United States Treasury Bills from a financial institution with an agreement that the financial institution would repurchase the Treasury Bills at some definite, future date, not to exceed one year from date of investment; however, such investments must be carefully tailored to meet precisely normal payment schedules of state obligations. OAG 82-209.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since proposed “reverse repurchase agreements,” by which the state would sell an investment that it held (such as Treasury Bills) for a specified number of days with the condition that the state repurchase the security at the end of that time, contemplated the use of “excess” funds (in excess of that amount required to meet current state expenditures under normal payment schedules) within the time limits of KRS 41.380(2) (now subsection (8) of this section), such agreements would be valid and permissible on the part of the State Investment Commission.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Auditor has the authority to audit only the accounts of state agencies and county officers and there is no state auditing agency in existence that can audit the records of a city. OAG 74-90.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (2) of this section refers only to payment of the State Auditor for audits and does no apply to a private CPA hired in lieu of the State Auditor. OAG 74-449.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sheriff is responsible for preparing and submitting his report of settlement to the fiscal court and the reasonable cost of preparing it may be considered an official expense of his office and paid out of his fees, even though the report may not be a formal or technical audit although a formal audit is the most desirable approach from the public viewpoint, since an accountant can accurately and competently determine the existence or nonexistence of excess fees. OAG 75-33.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Auditor is required to audit annually the funds contained in the county budget and the accounts of all county clerks, circuit clerks, county judges (now county judges/executive), county attorneys, sheriffs, jailers, coroners, constables and justices of the peace exercising criminal jurisdiction unless the elected official notifies the state auditor that he has employed a CPA to audit his official account prior to the beginning of the State Auditor’s audit. OAG 75-44.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county attorney, who submitted to a 1973 audit in early 1974 and made settlement with the fiscal court for the deficiency in May, 1974, properly refused to submit to a duplicate audit by the State Auditor’s office in 1975 and there was no violation of KRS 43.990(3) since the intent of this section is to avoid unnecessary and duplicate audits. OAG 75-112.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So long as the $20.00, representing advance costs, remains in the trustee account in the custody of the clerk during the pendency of the suit, and prior to the termination of the suit and the taxing and paying of all costs, the auditor of public accounts has the responsibility of including such “receipts,” though technically not “fees” at that stage, in the auditing of such circuit clerk’s accounts, based upon the provisions in this section and KRS 64.810 that the “books, accounts, and papers” of circuit clerks shall be audited and the advance cost is revenue of the clerk’s office even in the custodial stage. OAG 75-233.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of KRS 64.340, where a misdemeanor defendant is not convicted, or the case does not proceed to judgment, a sheriff has no statutory means for collecting his fees and, since such fees are uncollectible, he is not accountable for them. OAG 75-393.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a misdemeanor defendant is convicted but never pays the costs, including the sheriff’s fees, the sheriff, as a fee officer, is accountable in his audit for such uncollected fees unless he shows to the Auditor that he took all reasonable and practical means to collect such fees, although the statutes do not make the sheriff an insurer of the collection of fees legally due and payable. OAG 75-393.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The controlling factor in determining whether the county pays the entire cost of a state audit, as this section provides by the amendment thereto effective June 21, 1974, is the date the audit is conducted, not the calendar year of the accounts audited. OAG 75-620.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As there is nothing in the 1974 amendment to this section prohibiting retroactive application, such is permissible where the amendment is merely being applied to audits conducted after the amendment’s effective date though involving an account year prior to 1974. OAG 75-653.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the new system of uniform accounting and standard bookkeeping procedures for all counties and county officials was to be established by January, 1975, pursuant to KRS 68.210, the installation of the new system of auditing of county officials called for by this section and KRS 64.810 was mandatorily required as of January, 1975, and not before. OAG 76-51.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Auditor has the primary responsibility for sending a written audit report of county officials and the letter of transmittal to a newspaper having general circulation in the county examined, and if the audit concerns the county’s budget then the Auditor’s office will have to pay one-half of the publication. OAG 76-204.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All of the revenue for the 1976-78 biennium provided for in the 1976-78 biennial budget for the Auditor of Public Accounts can be utilized by such office for expenditure to carry out the necessary constitutional functions of such office which functions are determined to be necessary constitutional functions of government. OAG 76-558.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Auditor should bill the counties for the entire cost of the “state” audit as well as the county fee officers audit. OAG 77-50.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Audits of the county auditor’s office should cover each calendar year during the term of the county attorney. OAG 78-359.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of audit, under this section, and for the purpose of determining the sheriff’s aggregate rubber dollar income under Ky. Const., § 246, payments made by the Army Corps of Engineers to county sheriffs under contracts to provide law enforcement to designated civil works water resource projects are to financially assist the sheriffs to step up law enforcement activities in such projects during peak visitation periods, are impressed with a public fee character, accrue to the office, and count toward the aggregate rubber dollar limit for that year. OAG 79-454.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the United States Department of the Army Corps of Engineers has contracted with various fiscal courts and sheriffs for increased law enforcement at civil works water resource projects, the federal financial assistance paid to the fiscal court or the sheriff is construed, for audit purposes of the affected county and sheriff’s income, as included in the audit of the county treasurer, if paid to him, and as county sheriff’s fee income, if paid to him. OAG 79-454.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where jailer is carrying on a commissary operation in the jail, he should maintain commissary records in order to provide an adequate basis for determining whether he is operating at a profit to himself or not; such records take on the nature of public records since there is no logical way to disassociate the commissary activity of this public officer from his functions as jailer, and would be a part of the total official records as concerns any auditing of the books. OAG 80-525.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The audit by the Auditor of Public Accounts apparently carries with it a presumption of the financial status or of correctness as to the county clerk’s account for the year, unless such presumption is overturned or overcome in some way in an appropriate law suit; the exception to this would arise where the account involves “unliquidated claims,” and in which case the fiscal court acting in good faith could work out a compromise with the clerk as to any unliquidated claims. OAG 80-618.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorneys of Kentucky are not required to publish a financial statement pursuant to KRS 424.220 since the auditing of the county attorney’s books pursuant to this section and KRS 64.810 is ample to disclose the specifics of his official operation. OAG 81-168.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Auditor of Public Accounts is an administrative officer, not a legal officer, and must observe the inherent limitations of KRS 43.050, 43.075, 43.090 and this section. OAG 82-333.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statute which authorizes a county to charge interest on money owed from any fee officer after his audit has been completed for that year. OAG 82-489.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Auditor’s duty under KRS 43.070 et seq. requires audit reports of each officer, rather than one report for both the elected officer and the appointed successor, because without separate reports the Auditor’s findings would not reflect the separate liabilities, if any, of the person having responsibility for the public funds. OAG 91-227.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 64.810, a fiscal court, county clerk, or sheriff has authority to employ a certified public accountant to perform to audit called for by this section, only if the Auditor of Public Accounts declines to perform such audit, or has failed to respond within 30 days to a written notice of intent to employ a certified accountant for such purpose.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“When due” within the meaning of this section includes the requirement that the services have been rendered. OAG 79-448.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The advance payment of money to the Brussels office of the European economic development office of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the purpose of paying certain operational expenses is constitutional under Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 171 and meets precisely the requirements of this section that claims against the state treasury be paid only when due since the final and effective disbursement of the operational money is only effected after the persons or corporations have actually performed the services. OAG 79-532.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any practice of making full or partial payments on state personal service contracts in advance of the actual and full performance of the contract is unconstitutional. OAG 80-38.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutory law and Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 171 mandate the payment of state money only after the services have been rendered or performed. OAG 82-281.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where it is contemplated that state money must be turned over or advanced to private or corporate contractors before contractual services are actually rendered, and the state officials engaging in the contracts determine in good faith that such advancements are necessary in point of time and the ultimate rendering of the services sought, such advancements may be constitutional under these conditions: (1) the contract must expressly provide that the responsible contractor will not make final effective disbursement of the advanced state funds until the contractual services have in fact been rendered; (2) in order to protect the State Treasury, the contractor must execute a suitable bond or procure an insurance contract providing for full repayment to the state where advanced money has been disbursed without reflecting the concomitant contractual services to be rendered. OAG 82-281.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state’s money remains in the hands of officials or employes of state government and the money is not finally and effectively paid out until the services are performed, such an arrangement is valid under Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 171. OAG 82-281.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action for negligence pursuant to this section appears to be the only potential way recovery may be had from the Commonwealth for damages caused by wild deer if, indeed, recovery may be had at all. OAG 90-70.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There being no legislative waiver of the Commonwealth’s immunity from suit for damage by wild deer, and there being no legal duty of the Commonwealth to prevent wild deer from damaging persons or property such as would give rise to a Board of Claims action sounding in negligence, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, incurs no legal liability as a result of wild deer injuring persons or damaging property. OAG 90-70.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the limited circumstance where federal law preempts state law that would otherwise govern, the State Treasurer may authorize, without a completed “warrant” at the time the authorization is given, the financial agent of the U.S. Treasury to debit the bank account of the Commonwealth for the amount the Commonwealth owes in federal tax deposits.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs maintained that under this section an award of attorney fees against the Commonwealth could only be reviewed by the Franklin Circuit Court. However, the case was unique in that the Franklin Circuit Court was the court which ordered the award of attorneys fees against the Commonwealth and since statutes must be given a practical construction, and will not be given strict or literal reading where this would lead to an absurd or unreasonable conclusion, it would be unreasonable for the Franklin Circuit Court to review its own decision. Giving the statute a practical construction in light of the special circumstances and the fact that all parties were entitled as a matter of right to one appeal under Ky. Const., § 115, the Court of Appeals held that its jurisdiction over the appeal in this case was proper. Revenue Cabinet v. Barbour, 836 S.W.2d 418, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 14 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims of the Circuit Court clerk for fees in lunacy cases presided over by the county judge (now county judge/executive) may be approved by said judge at the time of the inquest, otherwise they must be approved by the Circuit Judge. OAG 65-457.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although subsection (2) of this section provides that an order of a court allowing fees, etc., shall not be treated as a “judgment,” the Legislature intended to say that such judgments for claims shall not be “final judgments,” since the Executive Department for Finance and Administration (now Finance and Administration Cabinet) may contest a particular claim in Franklin Circuit Court, which has exclusive jurisdiction of such matters. OAG 78-249.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section concerns only claims against the state allowed by courts, the inclusion of the “county court clerk” is a misnomer since there is no county court and is meaningless in that context. OAG 78-249.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “claims payable out of the state treasury,” as it appears in this section, means claims, arising out of court actions, for which there are statutory provisions or appropriations and would include statutory fees earned by local officials in court actions, which fees must be taxed as costs and included in the judgment. OAG 78-249.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fee based on the sheriff’s fee schedule contained in KRS 64.090 and paid to the sheriff for services in summoning grand and petit jurors and performing his duties under KRS Chapter 29A is payable out of the State Treasury; and since such claims would arise out of court actions, this section would apply. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 64.348 (now KRS 64.092), which involves fees for officers attending court and litigation, is silent as to who pays the fees, the strongest implication is that it must be borne by the state, for whom the services are rendered, thus this section would apply. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 421.250 which provides for procuring prosecuting witnesses from other states but does not cover defense witnesses, involves court action and thus this section applies. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 62.155, the premium on the sheriff’s general revenue bond and his faithful performance bond must be paid by the state; thus, in counties of 75,000 population or more, the chief circuit judge and Circuit Court, or fiscal court, as the case may be under KRS 64.345(2), may permit the sheriff to take the subject premium out of the sheriff’s “75% account” where the state has not otherwise paid the premium; however, this section does not apply. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Special bailiff compensation which is dealt with in KRS 421.135 involves a “felony case” and thus this section applies. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 29A.180(1), the sheriff, city police or city marshal, as appropriate, shall be initially responsible for meals, housing, and other incidental needs of grand jurors and petit jurors in circuit and district court when the jurors are kept overnight or otherwise sequestered, when ordered to do so by the judge of the court for which the jurors were summoned and, since the officer who had to pay for such services initially will be reimbursed by the Finance Department (now Finance and Administration Cabinet), this section is not involved. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jailer fees enumerated in KRS 64.150 (now repealed), including the prisoner dieting fee and court attendance fee, must be paid by the government whose law the prisoner is charged with violating; thus, if the prisoner is charged with violating a state statute, the state must pay the jailer fees and this section, involving court approval of the fees, applies. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section applies to KRS 421.015 which pertains to a mileage allowance for Kentucky witnesses in Circuit and District Courts. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section applies to KRS 421.030, which relates to nonresident prosecutorial witness expenses in felony cases. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not apply to KRS 441.010 (now KRS 441.045), under which the state must pay for nonpostponable medical care extended to an indigent prisoner in the county jail, provided the prisoner is charged with violating a state statute and is not a prisoner of the United States. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not apply to the payment of the jury commissioners or jurors, both of which must be effected by each circuit clerk out of one or two imprest funds of the clerk established by the state treasurer and the Department of Finance (now Finance and Administration Cabinet) pursuant to KRS 30A.110. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section may be read together and applied with KRS 64.070(2), (4), KRS 441.030 (now KRS 441.520), and KRS 441.040 (now KRS 441.530), relating to the transfer of prisoners to a secure jail or to the penitentiary, and the court order directing the transfer and awarding the sheriff compensation therefor, and KRS 441.050 (now KRS 441.540) relating to the transfer of a prisoner to the penitentiary when violence is threatened and the court approval of fees for the sheriff. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section which provides the procedure for paying claims out of the state treasury would not apply to KRS 440.090, since the return of a fugitive or extradition under KRS 440.090 is effected through the Governor of Kentucky and the fugitive is brought back and placed in the jail of the county designated in the proclamation and thus, the extradition is accomplished outside the frame of litigation. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A court has no authority to direct the Finance and Administration Cabinet to make direct payments for deputy sheriff court attendance to the deputy sheriff so attending court since such fees are in legal reality the fees of the sheriff’s office; thus the payments should go directly to the sheriff. OAG 83-19.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the increased mileage allowance would not directly apply to a circuit clerk since he is a county official, it shows a legislative intent that a credit of ten cents per mile for official travel of a circuit clerk would not be unreasonable.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A regular and well-publicized schedule of trips by the clerk or his deputy to outlying areas in which a sizable demand for this service exists and is used would qualify for travel reimbursement if properly documented to show the purpose and official necessity of each trip and the distance traveled on each trip. OAG 68-231.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When this section is read together with KRS 45.180 (now repealed) it appears that it was the intent of the Legislature that state employees stationed in a city who must proceed regularly by vehicle from place to place within the city boundaries in the actual and necessary performance of their duties should be reimbursed for such travel expenses.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State department heads have no authority to establish a maximum level for reimbursements for official state travel involving motor vehicle, food, lodging, expenses, etc., which levels would constitute less than ten cents per mile for a privately owned motor vehicle and less than the actual expenses for food and lodging (and other expenses) presently reimbursable under the administrative regulations and statute.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 421.015 refers narrowly to a mileage allowance for witnesses in court, under the doctrine of in pari materia, i.e., reading related statutes together, witnesses who must travel to another county for appearance in Circuit Court would be entitled to the mileage allowance given state employees, and would be entitled to reimbursement for their necessary food and lodging costs as authorized in KRS 44.060, 45.101 and 45.180 (now repealed).

<p class="p6">(7/15/94). This section was amended by 1994 Ky. Acts chs. 7, 31, and 486. Where these Acts are not in conflict they have been codified together. Where a conflict exists between Acts chs. 7 and 31, Acts ch. 31, which was last enacted by the General Assembly, prevails under KRS 446.250.</p>
<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The original enactment of this section (SB 44, Chapter 4, Section 1, 1979 Ex. Sess.) is unconstitutional under Ky. Const., § 51 because the definition of a “major item of equipment” in subsection (1)(d) of this section included movable equipment coming under the term “capital construction” and coming under “noncapital construction equipment” and, therefore, the enactment violated the prohibition against a law relating to more than one subject. OAG 80-217.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The renovation of a fairgrounds stadium, to prepare it for use of a professional baseball team, if accomplished by a private nonprofit corporation using private capital, need not comply with the provisions of the Capital Construction and Equipment Financing Act which regulates the expenditure of certain funds appropriated by the General Assembly. OAG 81-341.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (2) of this section, the equipment used in state road planning, mapping, preparing roadway plans, acquisition of rights-of-way, etc., is equipment used in connection with the construction and maintenance of roads and the purchase of such equipment is explicitly exempt from the statutes (KRS 45.750 to 45.800) governing capital construction and equipment financing. OAG 82-589.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Capital Construction Financing Act does not apply to the financing of a building’s construction by a private corporation such as the University of Kentucky Alumni Association. OAG 94-63.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bid protestor was entitled to seek judicial review of the award of the contract for statewide genetic testing services for the 2004 fiscal year, which was made to another vendor, even though the contract had expired, as a protestor has standing to seek judicial review as such a matter presents a case and controversy despite the contract ending. However, judgment in favor of the various Commonwealth of Kentucky agencies and the winning bid maker was upheld on appeal, because the substance of the protestor’s complaint alleged alternative interpretation of the bid terms, which was a discretion afforded to the Commonwealth as a contracting officer in a negotiated procurement, and the protestor provided no valid reason, such as fraud, in challenging the award to the winning bid maker. Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Rudolph, 184 S.W.3d 68, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 169 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bid protestor has standing to challenge a contract award and an actual case or controversy exists in spite of the underlying contract’s expiration.

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motor vehicle dealers in states other than Kentucky are eligible to respond to invitations to bid on new motor vehicles and subsequently sell the vehicles to Kentucky upon proper award even though they are not licensed as dealers under KRS 190.010, since the statutes KRS Chapter 190 and the Model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A are not in pari materia and do not have to be construed together; thus, the necessity for the state to purchase at the lowest possible cost under KRS 45.360 (now repealed) and this section and the policy against restraint of trade under KRS 367.175 combine to allow the state to purchase motor vehicles from out-of-state dealers who are not licensed in Kentucky. OAG 81-89.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The necessity for the state to purchase at the lowest possible cost under KRS 45.360 (now repealed) and this section and the policy against restraint of trade reflected in KRS 367.175 combine to allow the state to purchase motor vehicles from out-of-state dealers who are not licensed in Kentucky. OAG 81-89.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court of a county may lease a portion of the tobacco base owned by the county to individuals, since the power of the court under KRS 67.080 to sell real property includes the power to lease, and the lease of county property does not come under the competitive bidding requirements of KRS 424.260 and the Model Procurement Code (KRS 45A.010 to 45A.460, 45A.990) since the bidding principle applies only to governmental acquisitions, not situations where the government is the lessor; however, the lease must contain the precise consideration given, since the fiscal court must make full public disclosure of its transactions. OAG 81-107.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Center for the Arts Corporation is not subject to the terms, provisions and requirements of the Model Procurement Code as it relates to procurement by the state since the corporation does not and will not expend public funds of the Commonwealth, is not a budget unit of the Commonwealth and receives operating revenues from external sources. OAG 81-129.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Model Procurement Code would not apply to a nonprofit corporation organized to raise money to provide a city facility suitable for a professional baseball team nor to the renovation contracts entered into by the corporation since the corporation is not a public agency within the meaning of the Code and because the Code only applies where the agency is a purchaser, buyer or lessee, not where, as here, the corporation would be a lessor. OAG 81-341.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plain reading of KRS 45A.420(2) shows that the General Assembly intended for that section to be an exception to the usual bidding requirements. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Construing KRS 45A.420(2) as an exception to the usual bidding requirements is not contrary to the underlying policies of the code. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Model Procurement Code allows local public agencies to be flexible in order to take advantage of discounts or cost savings available by means of noncompetitive negotiations if competitive negotiations would not yield greater savings in a given circumstance. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The whole thrust of the Model Procurement Code is to encourage and insist that local public agencies purchase services and supplies only after competitive sealed bidding unless good reason is shown why competitive sealed bidding is inappropriate. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A Labor Agreement between a local Board of Education and a Labor Union in a school construction project is not prohibited provided the terms of the labor agreement do not offend or violate the Kentucky Model Procurement Code (KRS Chapter 45A) or the public school construction statute found at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 162.070.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>OAG 10-006.</p>

OAG 79-255.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A governmental unit has, in connection with competitive sealed bidding, one of two choices: (1) The invitation for bids shall be let on the basis of the lowest bid price; or (2) the invitation for bids shall be let on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid price, and only one basis can be used, not both, because the prospective bidders must be allowed to bid on the same thing and using the identical method. OAG 80-311.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no statute making bids which have been opened on a public project exempt from the Open Records Law requirement; on the contrary, even without the Open Records Law, under subsection (4) of this section bidding documents are open to public inspection after the bids have been opened. OAG 80-327.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The emergency clause of Acts 1982, ch. 282 related solely to § 3 of the act which amended KRS 45A.335 to exclude members of state boards and commissions from the term “officer or employe,” as used in the conflict of interest statute, KRS 45A.340(5); it not only did not relate to the other sections of the bill, which were separable, but it gave no reason to justify that an emergency existed with respect to these sections. In view of the fact that Ky. Const., § 55 requires an act to express in plain language what the emergency is in order for it to be effective, only § 3 became effective on April 2, 1982, upon the passage of the act and approval of the Governor, and the remaining sections of the act became effective as ordinary legislation on July 15, 1982.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Governor owned a controlling interest in a hotel, and the state was the primary user of the hotel, the use of the facilities by Commonwealth employees and agencies would exceed $25 each and would not involve competitive bidding; therefore, these transactions would involve an illegal conflict of interest in violation of subsection (5) of KRS 45A.340 and this section.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Competitive sealed bidding and competitive negotiation are two separate procurement processes that do not overlap; a public disclosure of bid documents associated with a competitive sealed bid cannot be delayed until a determination is made as to whether the contracting agency will move to competitive negotiation.

The opinion of the agency contract administrator shall be made in writing or electronically, set forth the reasons for his or her opinion regarding compliance or noncompliance, and be signed by the agency contract administrator. This opinion may have an electronic signature. The using agency head shall, after consideration of the performance audits, the final performance review, and the opinion of the agency contract administrator regarding compliance or noncompliance, determine whether to recommend to the purchasing agency that the performance bond be released or whether a claim should be made against the performance bond. This determination of the using agency head shall be in writing, signed by the using agency head, and forwarded to the purchasing agency. This determination may have an electronic signature and be transmitted electronically. If the recommendation of the using agency is not followed by the purchasing agency, the purchasing agency shall place a statement in the file explaining why it is not followed.</p>

All-American Movers, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 552 S.W.2d 679, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 732 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of appeals properly affirmed the order denying a university immunity against a professor's lawsuit; the legislature has waived immunity for all claims arising out of lawfully authorized written contracts with the Commonwealth and its agencies. Univ. of Louisville v. Rothstein, 2017 Ky. LEXIS 449 (Nov. 2, 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute clearly intends a waiver of the defense of governmental immunity, and there is no other “reasonable construction” of the statute; the legislature clearly stated that the defense of governmental immunity was not preserved for the Commonwealth on these contract claims. Univ. of Louisville v. Rothstein, 2017 Ky. LEXIS 449 (Nov. 2, 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1) waives the defense of governmental immunity in all claims based upon lawfully authorized written contracts, and the legislature chose to utilize this language, without restriction or limitation; there is no reason, therefore, to impose a constraint unintended or unexpressed by the General Assembly, and clearly, the legislature has waived governmental immunity on all claims brought by all persons on all lawfully authorized written contracts with the Commonwealth. Univ. of Louisville v. Rothstein, 2017 Ky. LEXIS 449 (Nov. 2, 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a university’s challenge to prejudgment interest awarded to a construction company in a breach of contract claim, KRS 45A.245 waived sovereign immunity in contract actions against the state with a cap on damages of twice the original contract price. Because the cap was the only limiting factor on damages, the trial court was correct in awarding prejudgment interest. Univ. of Louisville v. RAM Eng'g &amp; Constr., Inc., 199 S.W.3d 746, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 244 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That the legislature waived the Commonwealth’s immunity in some statutes under certain instances was evidenced by statutes like KRS 45A.245. That statute allowed a party to bring an action against the Commonwealth to recover for breach of contract or the enforcement of a contract, and indicated that the retirement system members suing the Commonwealth due to a suspension of their retirement benefits while they came back to work for a public employer did not have to always be thwarted by the Commonwealth’s claim of sovereign immunity.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims by a Chapter 7 Trustee against the State for fraud in the inducement, breach of contract, and unenforceable penalty were dismissed. While the State waived its immunity for claims on written contracts under KRS 45A.245(1), it did so only for actions brought in Franklin County Circuit Court; Even if the court could consider KRS 45A.245(1) a waiver to proceed in federal court, that waiver applied only to actions on the contract, the claim for fraudulent inducement was not “on the contract” and was a tort-like claim for which the State did not waive its sovereign immunity. Lawrence v. Kentucky Transp. Cabinet (In re Shelbyville Rd. Shoppes, LLC), 486 B.R. 848, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 648 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No language in the Kentucky Model Procurement Code (KMPC), KRS 45A.245(1), stated that the Commonwealth’s immunity for claims that it violated the KMPC was waived, and the subcontractor’s claims for monetary damages not based on a written contract were precluded by sovereign immunity. Louisville Arena Auth., Inc. v. Ram Eng'g &amp; Constr., Inc., 415 S.W.3d 671, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 132 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a dispute involving Medicaid reimbursements, the Kentucky Legislature waived the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ immunity from a breach of contract claim by operation of this section; however, the hospital was only entitled to seek a declaration of its rights under a Medicaid provider services agreement since a direct recovery of contractual damages was outside the scope of declaratory relief. Commonwealth v. Samaritan Alliance, LLC, 439 S.W.3d 757, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 27 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Commonwealth and its agencies no longer enjoy immunity for the breach of a written contract entered into with a private citizen; therefore, a State university was not immune from a former employee's lawsuit alleging breach of a written employment contract because the waiver of immunity for actions brought on written contracts applied to employment contracts.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff student-athlete could not maintain a claim for breach of contract under Kentucky law against defendant university premised on a student athlete handbook because the state sovereign immunity doctrine barred suit with respect to the claim, and the immunity could not be waived in federal district court by any action of defendant’s own volition, such as the creation or adoption of any written document that may purport or appear to bind the university, its employees or both. Even assuming that any such contract or agreement between defendant and plaintiff existed and that any waiver was permitted, it would have been of a limited nature, and plaintiff would have needed to proceed on any written contract as set forth in KRS 45A.245(1) in a suit against the commonwealth in state court.

<p class="p7">The purpose of KRS 45A.330 to 45A.340 is to prescribe specific standards to guide public officers and employees in the conduct of their offices or employment, and to proscribe improper conduct to the extent to which such conduct may be sufficiently described to enable statutory prohibitions against it to be properly enforced. It is at the same time recognized that under a free government it is both necessary and desirable that all citizens should have certain specific interests in the decisions of government, and that the activities and conduct of public officers and employees should not be unduly circumscribed.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The emergency clause of Acts 1982, ch. 282 related solely to § 3 of the act which amended this section to exclude members of state boards and commissions from the term “officer or employee,” as used in the conflict of interest statute, KRS 45A.340(5); it not only did not relate to the other sections of the bill, which were separable, but it gave no reason to justify that an emergency existed with respect to these sections. In view of the fact that Ky. Const., § 55 requires an act to express in plain language what the emergency is in order for it to be effective only § 3 became effective on April 2, 1982, upon the passage of the act and approval of the Governor, and the remaining sections of the act became effective as ordinary legislation on July 15, 1982.

It is presumed that the General Assembly intended the act with the emergency clause to prevail; thus the adoption of the Model Procurement Code by any local public agency is optional.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 45A.425 does not make it mandatory that the agency follow the other sections of Chapter 45A in disposing or selling of its property, since it provides that it “may” sell in accordance with the code and, by virtue of subdivision (10) of this section, “may” means permissive. Ohio River Conversions, Inc. v. Owensboro, 663 S.W.2d 759, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 444 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).</p>
<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A city electric plant board, operating under KRS 96.550 to 96.900, is a board or agency of that city, itself a subdivision of the state. OAG 79-618.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of “local public agency” in subsection (9) of this section clearly includes any agency of a city and its boards or commissions. OAG 79-618.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The electric plant board of the city of Paducah, operating under KRS 96.550 to 96.900, is required to abide by the terms of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code. OAG 79-618. But see OAG 80-279.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fire protection district is a special district within the definition of a local public agency in subdivision (9) of this section; therefore, the model procurement code, KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460, applies to fire protection districts. OAG 79-647; 80-12. But see OAG 80-279.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Model Procurement Code is sufficiently flexible to permit the designation of more than one specific individual as a procurement or purchasing agent or officer. OAG 80-21.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Model Procurement Act, which became effective for local public agencies as of January 1, 1980, applies to the purchasing procedures of a municipally owned electric distribution system operating under the Little TVA Act. OAG 80-63. But see OAG 80-279.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As of January 1, 1980, riverport authorities must look to the applicable provisions of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code in connection with their procurement programs. OAG 80-71.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “authority,” as used in this section, includes a riverport authority. OAG 80-71.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A, does not govern any transaction unless there will be an expenditure of a local public agency’s funds for either services, supplies or construction; where no school funds, either general account or activity account, are expended in the purchasing of graduation rings, graduation invitations or caps and gowns, the provisions of the Model Procurement Code have no application. OAG 80-108.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A local air board is a local public agency as defined in subsection (9) of this section, subject to those sections of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code dealing with procurement by a local public agency, KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460; if the air board is the lessor, the code does not have to be applied but if the air board is the lessee, the code does apply and must be utilized. OAG 80-117. But see OAG 80-279.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the literal language of subsection (9) of this section, a county hospital commission is a local public agency, since it is a commission and subunit of a political subdivision, i.e., of a county. OAG 80-128.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a city has established a separate independent agency to administer the Urban Renewal Act pursuant to KRS 99.350, that urban renewal agency would constitute a “local public agency” as defined in subsection (9) of this section and, therefore, the agency would have to follow the requirements of the Model Procurement Code. OAG 80-169.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The enumerated county constitutional officers listed as subunits of a county in subsection (8) (now subsection (9)) of this section must generally integrate their procurement contracts with the fiscal court’s procurement program. OAG 80-180.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A volunteer fire protection district, established under KRS Chapter 75, is a “local public agency,” as defined in subsection (9) of this section since it is a “special district” and a “political subdivision”, thus the volunteer fire department district would come under the Model Procurement Code (KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460), provided that the district so chooses to come under the code. OAG 80-301.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county metropolitan server district may, whether operating under KRS 424.260, the bidding statute, or this section, the model procurement code, adopt a “Buy American” clause, which requires a contractor or supplier to furnish only goods manufactured in America, as a standard procurement policy, included in all purchasing contracts and bid specifications. OAG 81-34.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a fiscal court has specifically adopted the Kentucky Model Procurement Code under KRS 45A.350 (now repealed) it must under subdivision (23) of this section purchase insurance under a competitive bidding system, even though KRS 424.260 excepts professional services such as insurance from competitive bidding. OAG 81-109.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statutory requirement of advertisement for bids is “jurisdictional,” and a fiscal court is without power to enter into a contract without such advertisement, where the purchase requires bidding. Further, a party deals with a public agency at its peril if it contracts with one and fails to inquire into the power of the agency to execute it. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The matter of letting out for bids the gasoline and oil needed for the county road department is left to the good business judgment of the fiscal court in terms of the period of consumption, price fluctuations, availability of the commodity for a definite period, etc. However, a fiscal court should not deliberately buy the needed commodities in “dribbles and dabs” merely to circumvent advertised bidding. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The number of months’ supply of any needed commodity which must be considered for bidding purposes is a matter, because of its nature, that must be left to the sound administrative discretion of the fiscal court. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The three important benefits of the bidding process are: (a) an offering to the public, (b) an opportunity for competition and (c) a basis for an exact comparison of bids. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a county is under KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460, KRS 45A.365, relating to the major policy of competitive sealed bidding, would apply to purchase of its gasoline, petroleum, and other supplies used by the county road department, except as otherwise provided by KRS 45A.370 to 45A.385. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a school district has chosen to operate under the Model Procurement Code, competitive bidding for general liability insurance on buildings and vehicles, etc., is required absent a legitimate, written determination by the local public agency to the contrary; this conclusion is based on the fact that in subdivision (23) of this section, the term “supplies” is defined to include insurance, and that KRS 45A.380(10) authorizes an exemption from competitive bidding by written determination if the “contract is for group life insurance, group health and accident insurance, group professional liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and unemployment insurance,” an exemption which does not include general liability insurance. OAG 82-170.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no conflict between KRS 424.260 and the Model Procurement Code, KRS Ch. 45A, concerning the necessity of school boards taking competitive bids for general liability insurance, since local school districts, as local public agencies, have a choice as to whether to operate with respect to their procurement needs under either the local Model Procurement Code or KRS 424.260. OAG 82-170.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts 1982, ch. 282, which amended KRS 45A.080, 45A.100 and 45A.335, had no effect upon fiscal courts which had adopted KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460. OAG 82-324.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any fiscal court adopting KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460 may, under KRS 45A.385, effect purchases not exceeding $5,000 (now $7,500) without formal bidding procedures, while those fiscal courts, under current law, which have not adopted such sections, are governed by KRS 424.260. OAG 82-324.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county sheriff is not required to follow the purchasing procedures of the urban county government and may or may not adopt KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460 of the Model Procurement Code. OAG 83-249.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Should a fee officer have to purchase items of equipment or personal property that are not consumable but will have a reasonable life span, such as motor vehicles, the title would be taken in the name of the county and the purchases would be subject to the county’s handling of the purchases and applicable provisions relating to bidding law under KRS 424.260 or KRS Chapter 45A (where the fiscal court has adopted the provisions of KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460). Where the county clerk or sheriff has adopted KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460, such officer could handle the purchase under the applicable bidding law in KRS Chapter 45A, but only with the approval of the fiscal court; and the title to the nonconsumable property or property of any reasonable life span would be in the name of the county. OAG 83-448.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though a riverport authority is created jointly by a city and county, the created authority is still a body politic and corporate, it is still a special district and, thus, the district, i.e., the riverport authority, is subject to the bidding principle under KRS 424.260, or the Model Procurement Code if adopted by the authority. OAG 84-196.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bidding statute, KRS 424.260, applies to a riverport authority created pursuant to KRS 65.510 et seq., unless the authority has specifically adopted the Model Procurement Code (KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460), in which latter case the Model Procurement Code, with its bidding requirements, applies to the riverport authority. OAG 84-196.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fire protection district is a local public agency under subsection (9) of this section. OAG 85-65.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 45A.420(2) allows a public agency to contract, without bidding, with a vendor who is on the current state contract list but is offering the agency a price lower than on the state price list, provided the local agency has adopted the provisions of this section through KRS 45A.460 as authorized under KRS 45A.343. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Model Procurement Code allows local public agencies to be flexible in order to take advantage of discounts or cost savings available by means of noncompetitive negotiations if competitive negotiations would not yield greater savings in a given circumstance. OAG 90-75.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirements of KRS 45A.380 concerning “noncompetitive negotiation,” as that term is defined by subdivision (12) of this section, allow a local public agency to enter into contracts by noncompetitive negotiations and without bidding, if it simply makes a written determination that competitive negotiation is not feasible and the contract is for a sale of supplies at reduced prices that will afford a purchase at savings to the local public agency.

<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The local public agency shall utilize the request for proposal process to enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract. The local public agency may, at its discretion, utilize a request for qualifications, provided that the local public agency solicits qualification statements from multiple potentially qualified providers.

The public notice shall be made at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. After reviewing the proposals, a local public agency may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider if it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation measures recommended in the proposal would not exceed the amount to be saved in either energy or operational costs plus capital cost avoidance within the term of the contract from the date of installation, if the recommendations in the proposal are followed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> The guaranteed energy savings contract shall include a written guarantee of the qualified provider that either the energy or operational costs savings plus capital cost avoidance will meet or exceed the costs of the energy conservation measures within the term of the contract. The qualified provider shall, on an annual basis, reimburse the local public agency for any shortfall in guaranteed energy savings projected in the contract. A qualified provider shall provide a sufficient bond to the local public agency for the installation and the faithful performance of all the measures included in the contract. The guaranteed energy savings contract may provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed the term of the contract.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The qualified provider shall provide the local public agency with an annual reconciliation statement. The statement shall disclose any shortfalls or surplus between guaranteed energy and operational savings specified in the guaranteed energy savings contract and actual energy and operational savings incurred during a given guarantee year. The guarantee year shall consist of a twelve (12) month term commencing from the time that the energy conservation measures became fully operational. The qualified provider shall pay the local public agency any short fall in the guaranteed energy and operation savings within thirty (30) days after the total year savings have been determined. If there is a surplus in the actual guaranteed energy and operational savings in a given year, that surplus savings may be carried forward and applied against any possible savings shortfall in the following guarantee year, except that the surplus carried forward is limited to a period not to exceed one (1) year. If the qualified provider pays the local public agency for a short fall in energy or operational savings incurred during a given guarantee year and there is a surplus in energy or operational savings in future guarantee years, the qualified provider shall bill the local public agency for an amount not to exceed the amount of the short fall in the given guarantee year.</p>

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an original price contract on printing equipment and supplies to be used by the state was established with a company after invitations to bid were sent out, and then that contract was converted into a lease-purchase agreement without further bidding, the lease-purchase agreement was not validly executed since the original bidders were not given an opportunity to bid on the conversion conditions, and the piggybacking of another company’s equipment, by the contracting supplier, into and onto the lease-purchase agreement was illegal. OAG 80-189.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county fiscal court, which plans to renovate a building to be used as the county court facility, may not restrict and apply the invitations to bid only to general contractors with home offices in that county, since the Model Procurement Code applies to fiscal courts and there is nothing in the applicable sections of KRS Chapter 45A that would support such a restriction. OAG 80-215.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The whole thrust of the Model Procurement Code is to encourage and insist that local public agencies purchase services and supplies, which include personal property, only after competitive sealed bidding unless good reason is shown why competitive sealed bidding is inappropriate, and where through no fault of the city, the low bidder to whom the contract was awarded after the bids had been opened soon thereafter gave notice of their inability to perform at all under the contract due to the bankruptcy of the manufacturer of the buses relied on by the successful bidder, the circumstances of this situation warranted the accepting of the second low bid. OAG 80-559.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the fiscal court reasonably determines that competition in property insurance is actually competitive in an area, then the entire insurance package should be let out under this section which provides for competitive sealed bidding. OAG 81-109.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statutory requirement of advertisement for bids is “jurisdictional,” and a fiscal court is without power to enter into a contract without such advertisement, where the purchase requires bidding. Further, a party deals with a public agency at its peril if it contracts with one and fails to inquire into the power of the agency to execute it. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The matter of letting out for bids the gasoline and oil needed for the county road department is left to the good business judgment of the fiscal court in terms of the period of consumption, price fluctuations, availability of the commodity for a definite period, etc. However, a fiscal court should not deliberately buy the needed commodities in “dribbles and dabs” merely to circumvent advertised bidding. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The three important benefits of the bidding process are: (a) an offering to the public, (b) an opportunity for competition and (c) a basis for an exact comparison of bids. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a county is operating under KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460, this section, relating to the major policy of competitive sealed bidding, would apply to purchase of its gasoline, petroleum, and other supplies used by the county road department, except as otherwise provided by KRS 45A.370 to 45A.385. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a city soliciting insurance proposals to limit its list of bidders to those insurance agencies having major offices within the boundaries of the city limits would violate the purpose and intent of requiring competitive bidding under the Model Procurement Code or, for that matter, any other statute that requires competitive bidding. OAG 82-337.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of requiring bids is to invite competition and guard against favoritism, extravagance, fraud and corruption and to secure the best possible work at the least price that is prescribed. OAG 82-337.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where competitive bids are required, all persons desiring to bid must be afforded the opportunity to do so. OAG 82-337.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Should two newspapers in a county come up with an identical figure for circulation in their published statements of ownership, then the fiscal court could request the two newspapers to submit affidavits as to the circulation; in the event the affidavits contain identical figures of circulation, the courts would be asked to resolve the question of which newspaper has the largest circulation. OAG 83-247.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court resolution requiring that tiles and tires be purchased from the cheapest places in the county is in restrictive conflict with KRS 424.260 and subsection (5) of this section and is invalid. OAG 83-258.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No county fee officer can engage in a bidding contract of purchase of supplies or equipment, i.e., binding on the county, where the money for the purchase is to come directly out of the county treasury; the fiscal court is the authority in contracting for county supplies or equipment, payable out of the county treasury. OAG 83-448.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a city commission authorized private companies to bid for a contract to provide fire protection for the city and replace the present city fire department, as documentary material retained by a public agency, the bid invitation, correspondence pertaining to the bids, and the bids themselves were public records subject to the Open Records Law. Unless exempted by the provisions of KRS 61.878, these records are open to public inspection once the bids are publicly opened. OAG 84-284.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A local public agency that has not adopted the Model Procurement Code is not required to follow competitive bidding procedures for insurance, and may contract with an insurance broker to solicit and receive bids for insurance, although competitive bidding remains preferred.

<p class="p7">It is the finding of the General Assembly that a necessary component of waste management must be to reduce the quantity of waste; that recycling reduces the quantity of solid waste and reduces the costs to the state and local governments for collecting, transporting, landfilling, or incinerating solid waste, reduces litter on roadsides and waterways, creates income producing opportunities, and conserves energy and raw materials. It is also the finding of the General Assembly that government makes purchases in large volumes which significantly affects the availability, variety, price, and consumer acceptance of the products and services purchased by government. The General Assembly further finds that by eliminating policies and practices which discriminate against government procuring recycled material content products as well as products and services compatible with recycled material content goods, and that by requiring government purchases of products which contain the maximum possible amount of recycled materials, the availability and variety of recycled material content products will increase and removal and recycling of materials from the solid waste stream will grow. Finally, the General Assembly finds that instituting policies and practices to stimulate the availability and use of recycled material content products will help educate business and individual consumers about the value of recycling as a component of a waste management policy.</p>

However, judgment in favor of the various Commonwealth of Kentucky agencies and the winning bid maker was upheld on appeal, because the substance of the protestor’s complaint alleged alternative interpretation of the bid terms, which was a discretion afforded to the Commonwealth as a contracting officer in a negotiated procurement, and the protestor provided no valid reason, such as fraud, in challenging the award to the winning bid maker.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Accountability for assets or funds recovered by duly elected statewide constitutional officers is essential to the public trust, and is even more critical when that officer was a party to the action that resulted in the recovery by virtue of the public office he or she holds;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Public accountability demands the applicability of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A, Kentucky Open Records Law, KRS 61.870 to 61.884, and the Kentucky Open Meetings Law, KRS 61.805 to 61.850, so that the actions of individuals or agencies who are charged with the administration of funds or other assets are conducted in full view, and are open to public scrutiny; and</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Therefore, any other provision of the common law or statutory law to the contrary notwithstanding:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The provisions of subsection (3) of this section shall apply whenever the Attorney General or other duly elected statewide constitutional officer is a party or has entered his appearance in a legal action on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including ex rel. or other type actions, and a disposition of that action has resulted in the recovery of funds or assets to be held in trust by the Attorney General or other duly elected statewide constitutional officer or a person, organization, or entity created by the Attorney General or the Commonwealth, through court action or otherwise, to administer the trust funds or assets, for charitable, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational, or similar public purposes;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the provisions of subsection (4) of this section shall apply when any funds or assets of any kind or nature whatsoever, including but not limited to public funds as defined in KRS 446.010 and private funds or assets are recovered by judgment or settlement of a legal action by or on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including ex rel. or other type actions filed by a duly elected statewide constitutional officer under that officer’s statutory or common law authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Whenever the Attorney General or other duly elected statewide constitutional officer is a party to or has entered his appearance in, a legal action on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including ex rel. or other type actions, and a disposition of that action has resulted in the recovery of funds or assets to be held in trust by the Attorney General or other duly elected statewide constitutional officer or by a person, organization, or entity created by the Attorney General, or the Commonwealth, through court action or otherwise, to administer the trust funds or assets, for charitable, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational, or similar public purposes, those funds shall be deposited in the State Treasury and the funds or assets administered and disbursed by the Office of the Controller.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The Office of Attorney General may first recover its reasonable costs of litigation, as determined by the court and approved by the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet. After recovering the reasonable costs of litigation, any required consumer restitution or payments shall be made. All remaining funds shall be deposited in the general fund surplus account. Any costs recovered under this subsection shall be reported to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The common law, including the common law authority of any duly elected statewide constitutional officer, is specifically abrogated to the extent it is inconsistent with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Notwithstanding any statute or common law to the contrary, and except as provided in this subsection, an elected statewide constitutional officer or any other state official or agency shall not file or participate as a plaintiff, petitioner, party, intervening party, attorney, or amicus curiae in any litigation challenging the constitutionality of this section. State funds and employee time shall not be expended by any person or agency in support of such a challenge. If the constitutionality of this section is challenged, the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall be the sole named respondent in that litigation, and shall consult with the Legislative Research Commission regarding defense of that litigation.</p>
