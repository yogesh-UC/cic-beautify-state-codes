<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plain language of the repeal of KRS 386.180 indicates that the Kentucky Legislature intended to remove any form of statutorily imposed guidelines regulating the fee habits of trustees of testamentary trusts, otherwise, the Legislature would have drafted and enacted a new law establishing how the fees should be calculated; therefore, in the absence of a statute directing otherwise, a court can only conclude that trustees of testamentary trusts are entitled to collect a “reasonable fee” commensurate with the performance of their duties. As a result, summary judgment was properly granted to several trustees in a compensation dispute where beneficiaries argued that the ceilings expressed in KRS 386.180 at the time the trusts were created remained in effect. Jarvis v. Nat'l City, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 20 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2011) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Holding in a declaratory judgment action that the trustees were not bound by the constraints of former KRS 386.180 was appropriate because the repeal was unlimited and trustees of testamentary trusts could collect reasonable fees on trusts that predate the repeal of KRS 386.180. Jarvis v. Nat'l City, 410 S.W.3d 148, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 394 (Ky. 2013) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> As used in this section:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> “Payment” means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one (1) or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer’s general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For purposes of subsections (4), (5), (6), and (7) of this section, the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment; and</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> “Separate fund” includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not “required to be made” to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, subsections (6) and (7) of this section shall apply, and subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to:</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to KRS 386.450 to 386.504. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal three percent (3%) of the fund’s value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund’s value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under 26 U.S.C. sec. 7520, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.</p>

There was conflicting evidence as to whether royalties had been underpaid, and the lessee had cured the alleged default by paying the disputed amount while the appeal was pending; moreover, an alleged mining permit violation could not serve as a basis to find the lessee in default absent an agency determination under KRS ch. 350 that such a violation existed.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The trustee of a trust having its principal place of administration in this Commonwealth shall register the trust in the District Court of this Commonwealth at the principal place of administration. Unless otherwise designated in the trust instrument, the principal place of administration of a trust is the trustee’s usual place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or at the trustee’s residence if he or she has no such place of business. In the case of cotrustees, the principal place of administration, if not otherwise designated in the trust instrument, is:</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a) 1.</b> The usual place of business of the corporate trustee if there is but one (1) corporate cotrustee; or</p>

<p class="p6">The duty to register under this section shall not apply to the trustee of a trust if registration would be inconsistent with the retained jurisdiction of a foreign court from which the trustee cannot obtain release, nor does the duty to register under this section apply to any trust, whether testamentary or inter vivos, revocable or irrevocable, unless the settlor of the trust so directs.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which he or she acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> In the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate;</p>

<p class="p6">If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this Commonwealth is ineffective until the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred, or an instrument signed by the trustee and all beneficiaries is filed with the registration in this state.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3) (a)</b> By registering a trust, or accepting the trusteeship of a registered trust, the trustee submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding under this chapter relating to the trust that may be initiated by any interested person while the trust remains registered. Notice of any proceeding shall be given pursuant to KRS 386B.1-070.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> To the extent of their interests in the trust, all beneficiaries of a trust properly registered in this Commonwealth are subject to the jurisdiction of the court of registration for the purposes of proceedings under this chapter, provided notice is given pursuant to KRS 386B.1-070.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> The court for good cause shown may provide for a different method or time of giving notice for any hearing.</p>

<p class="p6">When a minor or other person under disability, having no guardian or conservator, is entitled to receive a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), exclusive of interest, in any action in which real estate has been sold or in the settlement of any estate or from any other source, the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability may settle or compromise the dollar amount when in the interest of the minor or other person under disability. The court in which the action is pending, or, if the sum does not derive from the action, the District Court, may order the sum to be paid to the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability. Before entering the order, the court shall approve any settlement or compromise and shall be satisfied by affidavit or oral testimony that the minor or other person under disability is in the custody of the person to whom it is proposed to pay the money and the latter, upon withdrawal of the money, shall be under obligation as trustee to expend it, for the support, maintenance, or education of the minor or other person under disability. When the order is made, no bond shall be required of the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability and the purchaser of the real property may pay the share of the minor or other person under disability into court, and no lien shall remain on the property therefor and the money may be withdrawn by the person mentioned in the order without that person giving bond. A release executed by the person to whom the court has ordered the sum paid shall have the same effect as a release by a duly appointed guardian.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Any person of full age and sound mind may execute a verified petition for the voluntary appointment of a guardian or a conservator of that person’s property upon the express condition that the petition shall be acted upon by the court only upon the occurrence of an event specified or the existence of a described condition of the mental or physical health of the petitioner, the occurrence of which event, or the existence of which condition, shall be established in the manner directed in the petition. The petition, when filed, shall be accompanied by an affidavit from a licensed physician indicating that the person who signed the petition is now disabled as defined in KRS 387.510.

<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The petition may be deposited with the circuit clerk of the county in which the party resides, or with any person, firm, bank, or trust company selected by the petitioner.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The petition may be revoked by the petitioner at any time before appointment of a guardian or conservator by the court, if the petitioner is of sound mind.

If the petition has been deposited with the clerk, the revocation may be deposited there.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> At any time after the deposit of the petition with the clerk, and before its revocation, it may be brought on for hearing by the filing of a verified statement to the effect that the occurrence of the event or the condition provided for in the petition has come to pass. If the petition has not been deposited with the clerk under the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, it may be brought on for hearing at any time by the filing of it and the verified statement with the circuit clerk of the county in which the person who executed the petition then resides.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> At the time the petition is filed, the court, without any notice, may appoint the guardian or conservator nominated in the petition or may set the petition for hearing on notice the court may prescribe.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of this section is to appoint a person to take care of the day-to-day personal business of an incompetent. The scope of authority, duties and accountability of a guardian is much broader than that of a traditional power of attorney, even one intended to survive disability. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian. DeGrella v. Elston, 858 S.W.2d 698, 1993 Ky. LEXIS 103 (Ky. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Legislative Intent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) of this section merely advises the trial court of the legislative intent to impose the least restrictive measures under the individual’s circumstances. The trial judge is not granted authority by this section to forego a hearing as set forth in KRS 387.570, because he is of the opinion that the respondent is being adequately taken care of by other means. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Due Process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process protections which are a part of the formal guardianship hearing do not vitiate the need for a hearing at the time of commitment. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Accountability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A guardian is answerable to a court and must file accountings at least annually; the attorney-in-fact is answerable and accountable only to the principal who may be mentally disabled. It is obvious that there must be adequate safeguards and control on the person who manages an incompetent’s estate and that a great disparity exists between the durable power of attorney and a guardian. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Durable Power of Attorney.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The durable power of attorney is not a substitute for the appointment of a guardian. The existence of a durable power of attorney cannot prevent the institution of guardianship proceedings. The disabled person is entitled to have the district court exercise control and supervision of her estate by the impaneling of a jury to determine whether she is disabled pursuant to chapter 387 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and if so to appoint a guardian in accordance with that chapter, and if a fiduciary is appointed then the power of attorney-in-fact shall terminate and an account must be given to the court-appointed fiduciary. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The durable power of attorney provided by KRS 386.093 does not make the appointment of a guardian automatically unnecessary. It was not intended to supplant the provisions of this section. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 22 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS 311.631(1), entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment confirming a decretal judicial sale of the vested real property of an infant would not be reversed upon appeal for the single reason that the judgment under which the sale was made was erroneous and was reversed after the sale was made and confirmed and deed made to purchaser, where the court which rendered the judgment decreeing the sale had competent jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the action, and the sale was regularly and fairly made, to a bona fide purchaser.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment selling the land of infants is void only if the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject or the parties, all of whom must be treated as being of full legal capacity, and, accordingly, mere irregularities and even prejudicial errors of reversible magnitude cannot overthrow a judgment on the ground of voidness, provided the rendering court had jurisdiction of the suit’s subject and parties.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> When two (2) or more persons other than tenants by the entirety in residential property actually occupied by them as a principal residence share title to real estate in such manner that a conveyance by them jointly would pass a fee simple title, any one (1) or more of them may bring an action for the sale or division thereof in the Circuit Court of the county in which the land, or the greater part thereof, lies, making parties defendant those owners who have not joined as plaintiffs. A fiduciary possessing a power of sale may institute such an action against owners of interests not represented by him. Defendant owners shall be brought before the court in the manner provided by the civil rules whether or not a fiduciary possesses a power of sale of the defendant’s interest, but any fiduciary possessing such a power shall also be made a defendant. The case shall be tried without a jury.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> A defendant who is under disability and for whom no fiduciary is acting shall be represented in the action by a guardian ad litem, but in the event of sale of such defendant’s interest the court shall retain control of the proceeds of such interest until a duly appointed and adequately bonded fiduciary or custodian pursuant to a court order makes claim to the funds.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> In all such actions indivisibility of the real estate shall be presumed unless an issue in respect thereto is raised by the pleading of any party, and if the court is satisfied from the evidence that the property is divisible, without materially impairing the value of any interest therein, division thereof pursuant to KRS 381.135 shall be ordered.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If a sale of all or any part of the real estate shall be ordered, the court shall refer the matter to the master commissioner or appoint a commissioner to conduct a public sale and convey the property upon terms of sale and disposition of the net proceeds as may have been determined by the court.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The death of any party pending the action and prior to distribution of the proceeds of sale or setting apart a divisible share shall not affect the action but the court may direct distribution or apportionment to the successors in interest of the decedent upon application therefor.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If the interest of any party be one for life, or other term, in any portion of the real estate, the court shall determine the value of such interest and direct that such party receive a portion of the net sale proceeds or portion of the property if divisible, in fee in satisfaction of such interest, but if any party to the action objects to such procedure, and if the court finds that such procedure would defeat the objects and purpose of a person not a party to the action, such as a testator, grantor or settlor, but that sale or division is nevertheless desirable, the court shall order that the interest of the life or term tenant shall continue as to his portion of the real estate or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, in the latter case by directing that the funds derived from the sale of that portion of the real estate in which the life or term interest existed be paid to a trustee, appointed by and accountable to the District Court, for reinvestment and distribution of income and principal in a manner consistent with the instrument under which the life or term estate was created.</p>
