<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under deed conveying land to trustees and their successors in perpetual succession in trust for the use of churches “that hold meeting there and for school purposes forever,” the deed reciting a valuable consideration and there being no words implying a condition or limitation, and there being no reversionary clause, the trustees took a fee-simple title. The words “for school purposes” were only descriptive of the nature of the only use the trustees might make of the property, and did not create a limitation or condition on the fee. Therefore, subsequent transfer of title to all school property to state, under act of legislature, did not cause a reverter. Board of Education v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the rule in this state that the law favors a division of land in kind rather than a sale and a division of the proceeds and this rule particularly obtains where the property sought to be divided or sold is farmland or other parcels of real estate reasonably susceptible of division.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the purchaser of a condominium unit receives a recordable deed conveying a fee simple title to the unit and an undivided interest in the common elements, since the owner may convey or encumber the unit in any manner he wishes, but in so doing he does not jeopardize the interests of any co-owner in the project, and since each condominium unit is taxed separately and a co-owner has no responsibility for the individual debts of other co-owners, the instrument or deed conveying or transferring such ownership would be subject to the real estate transfer tax imposed by KRS 142.050. However, where a corporation had only a 40-year lease which it would assign by an instrument of conveyance to individuals or corporations purchasing condominium units, the instrument used to transfer ownership was an assignment of a lease and was by definition not a deed; therefore the instruments conveying the leasehold interest of the corporation to individual purchasers were not subject to the real estate transfer tax imposed by KRS 142.050.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain, a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> An agreement to terminate a condominium shall be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratification thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> In the case of a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement shall set forth the minimum terms of the sale.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> In the case of a condominium containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but shall not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all the unit owners consent to the sale.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (8) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by KRS 381.9101 to 381.9207 or the declaration.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the common elements and, in a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the condominium, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section are as follows:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements, and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one (1) or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty (30) days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent (25%) of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner’s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner’s unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements; and</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(10)</b> If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any common elements constituting a portion of the real estate to the extent the common elements as described in and subject to the declaration have been developed.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 382.135 does not contravene the common law regarding the validity of any deed. As between the grantor and grantee, and third parties with notice, even a complete failure to include the consideration certificate called for in KRS 382.135 will not affect the validity of a deed if that deed contains the fundamental elements necessary to a valid and enforceable deed. The deed will remain unrecordable, however, until it substantially complies with KRS 382.135. Smith v. Vest, 265 S.W.3d 246, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 466 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 382.135 requires a certificate of consideration on a deed, it does not contravene Kentucky common law regarding deeds. The common law in Kentucky regarding deeds provides that it is fundamentally necessary that a conveyance identify the grantor or grantors in the body of the instrument in order to pass valid title. Branham v. Estate of Elkins, 425 S.W.3d 103, 2014 Ky. App. LEXIS 17 (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Enforceable Deed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A deed was valid and enforceable between the parties since the deed identified the grantor and the grantees, the parties admitted that the property was transferred into three equal shares, with right of survivorship, between the father, the daughter, and the husband, the husband accepted the deed, and the lodging of the deed for record in the proper office by the grantor was sufficient to constitute a delivery; it was irrelevant whether the deed was recordable under KRS 382.135. Smith v. Vest, 265 S.W.3d 246, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 466 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The deed in question is a valid deed if it contains the fundamental elements necessary to a valid and enforceable deed, which are: (1) a grantor and grantee; (2) delivery and acceptance; (3) a divesting of title by grantor and a vesting of title in the grantee. If each of these elements is present, the deed’s recordability in this case is irrelevant. Smith v. Vest, 265 S.W.3d 246, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 466 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellants argued that the sale of property to a company was contingent on their receipt of the proceeds from easements, but the court disagreed because, in part, appellants affirmed that the total consideration for the property was $250,000, and KRS 382.135 requires all deeds to contain a statement of the full consideration paid or a statement of the fair cash value of the property; the court would violate the spirit of the statute if the court rewarded appellants for under-reporting the consideration they believed they were due by almost $300,000.00.

If adopted, said index shall thereupon become the official general cross index of the records to which it pertains, and all persons shall be entitled to rely thereon to the same extent as if the index had been prepared by the county clerk.

When the general indexes are thus completed they shall constitute the official indexes and the clerk of the county shall keep the indexes up to date by indexing therein the records of all property within one (1) month from the date they are lodged for record, and when they are so indexed, the alphabetical cross-index of such instruments need no longer be preserved and when such records or any part of them become defaced or injured, the clerk shall transcribe the defaced or injured records into new books, and they shall be as valid in law as the original record. The fiscal court may in its discretion require the county clerk and his deputies to make such indexes as provided by this section without additional compensation or may allow the said clerk for his services rendered by him and his deputies reasonable compensation.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Unpublished decision:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> District court erred in finding that a deficient but recorded mortgage gave notice to the bankruptcy trustee because, under KRS 382.270, an improperly executed security interest that was recorded failed to provide constructive notice. The strong arm provision of the federal bankruptcy law, 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3), specifically prohibited trustees from having actual knowledge of the security interest; thus, the trustee could only be charged with constructive notice. Rogan v. America's Wholesale Lender (In re Vance), 99 Fed. Appx. 25, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 7171 (6th Cir. Ky. 2004).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Unpublished decision:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> Based upon the plain meaning of KRS 423.130, as well as Sixth Circuit caselaw, a notary had to identify who signed the mortgage in the Certificate of Acknowledgment. Therefore the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel correctly concluded that the mortgage did not provide constructive notice under KRS 382.270 to subsequent purchasers or creditors because it was not properly acknowledged under Kentucky law and was consequently subject to avoidance by the trustee pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544, and that it should have been preserved for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 551; accordingly, the court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment to the trustee. Burden v. CIT Group/Consumer Fin., Inc. (In re Wilson), 2007 FED App. 06447P, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 6433 (6th Cir. Ky. Mar. 19, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statement in subsection (1) of KRS 355.9-313 that KRS chapter 355 does not prevent the creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures or real estate pursuant to the Kentucky law which is applicable to real estate, attests to a legislative intent that the real estate mortgage or lien concept and the existing statutory formalities of this section and KRS 382.330 remain inviolate and unchanged. OAG 81-144.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A coal lease for five years or less would be recordable if it contains the entire agreement and is properly executed as required by law. OAG 82-296.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 382.080, standing alone, may contain some suggestion that a coal lease of five years or less may not require recordation, and unrecorded might prevail against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, such construction is not in conformity with the Kentucky law (including KRS 382.100 and this section) as interpreted by the courts. A coal lease of five years or less, to be good against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, must be properly recorded in the county clerk’s office. OAG 82-296.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of frauds, KRS 371.010, has no relation to the system of constructive notice established pursuant to KRS 382.100 and this section. Therefore, the recording of a memorandum of a coal lease will not suffice to be effective against bona fide purchasers for value without notice. OAG 82-296.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An unrecorded deed, if otherwise validly executed, delivered and accepted, is good against the grantor and his heirs; however, the deed is not valid as to a creditor or other purchaser without actual notice of the transaction. OAG 83-276.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An unrecorded deed would be valid and would prevail over a subsequent deed where the subsequent grantee knew or had notice of the unrecorded deed prior to the subsequent grantee’s purchase, or had information sufficient to put him on inquiry that would have led to its discovery, such information being equivalent to notice. OAG 83-276.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a subsequent grantee or creditor has no actual knowledge or notice of such prior deed or has no information sufficient to put the subsequent grantee on inquiry that would lead to the discovery of the prior deed upon a search, the prior and unrecorded deed would not be valid against such creditor or subsequent grantee. OAG 83-276.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A recorded mortgage is superior to a prior unrecorded mortgage, if it was a recordable instrument and the debt was created and the mortgage accepted without notice of the prior mortgage.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since KRS 382.270, KRS 382.280 and Kentucky case law do not address the specific situation of the judgment lien in this case, the rationale in the Restatement (Third) of Property should control: third parties who lend money used to purchase real estate in exchange for a mortgage hold special priority over all other recorded liens and judgments except where agreed otherwise by the parties or specified by statute. Ky. Legal Sys. Corp. v. Dunn, 205 S.W.3d 235, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 111 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a judgment lienholder recorded its lien before another mortgage was created on the property and later assigned, the judgment lien had priority under the recording statute, KRS 382.280. The doctrine of equitable subrogation did not apply, because an adequate title search would have prevented the assignee’s potential loss. Roberts v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., 2009 Ky.

The equities of the case did not favor application of equitable subrogation. W.M. Specialty Mortg., LLC v. Cmty. Trust Bank, Inc., 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 33 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky.

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> Liens by deed or mortgage may be discharged by an entry acknowledging their satisfaction on the margin of the record thereof, or in the alternative, at the option of the county clerk, in a marginal entry record, signed by the person entitled thereto, or his or her personal representative or agent, and attested by the clerk, or may be discharged by a separate deed of release, which shall recite the date of the instrument and deed book and the page wherein it is recorded. Such release in the case of a mortgage or deed of trust shall have the effect to reinstate the title in the mortgagor or grantor or person entitled thereto. Each entry in the marginal entry record shall be linked to its respective referenced instrument in the indexing system for the referenced instruments.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> If a lien or mortgage is released by a deed of release, the clerk shall immediately, at the option of the clerk, either link the release and its filing location to its respective referenced instrument in the indexing system for the referenced instrument, or endorse on the margin of the record wherein the lien is retained “Released by deed of release (stating whether in whole or in part) lodged for record (giving date, deed book and page wherein such deed of release may be found)” and the clerk shall also attest such certificate.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> When a mortgage is assigned to another person, the assignee shall file the assignment for recording with the county clerk within thirty (30) days of the assignment and the county clerk shall attest the assignment and shall note the assignment in the blank space, or in a marginal entry record, beside a listing of the book and page of the document being assigned. Provided, however, that an assignee that reassigns the note prior to the thirtieth day after first acquiring the assignment may request that the subsequent assignee file the unfiled assignment with the new reassignment.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> Delivering an assignment to the assignee or a lien release to the mortgagor shall not substitute for filing the assignment or release with the county clerk, as required by this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, nothing in this chapter shall require the legal holder of any note secured by lien in any deed or mortgage to file a release of any mortgage when the mortgage securing such paid note also secures a note or other obligation which remains unpaid.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> Failure of an assignee to record a mortgage assignment shall not affect the validity or perfection, or invalidity or lack of perfection, of a mortgage lien under applicable law.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 382.360(1), where a creditor mistakenly released its mortgage, the release dissolved the creditor’s interest in the property, and the creditor thus retained no interest in the property and there was no interest for Chapter 7 trustee to avoid. Even if the bankruptcy court considered the creditor’s possible equitable right to reinstate the mortgage to be an interest in the property that the trustee could avoid, the bankruptcy estate would have succeeded only to a released mortgage that would be subordinate to the intervening judicial lien creditors. Baker v. Hodge (In re Hodge), 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 1477 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. Sept. 28, 2004).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where creditor released its first mortgage even though the debtor still owed a balance, it could not rely on its second mortgage to encompass this balance as there was nothing in the agreement referred to in the second mortgage which suggested that it was anything but a free-standing agreement to borrow a sum certain; it did not implicate the debtor’s obligation under the first mortgage. Thus, under KRS 382.260(1), the first mortgage was dissolved. In re Colemire, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 2816 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. Aug. 27, 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a release did not recite the date of execution of the mortgage on a second parcel of property or at a minimum the correct deed and page recitation as required by KRS 382.360(1), the release did not terminate the bank’s lien on the second property and a Chapter 7 trustee could not avoid the bank’s security interest under 11 USCS § 544(b).

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> All landlords of residential property requiring security deposits prior to occupancy shall be required to deposit all tenants’ security deposits in an account used only for that purpose, in any bank or other lending institution subject to regulation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or any agency of the United States government. Prospective tenants shall be informed of the location of the separate account and the account number.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Prior to tendering any consideration deemed to be a security deposit, the prospective tenant shall be presented with a comprehensive listing of any then-existing damage to the unit which would be the basis for a charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing such damage. The tenant shall have the right to inspect the premises to ascertain the accuracy of such listing prior to taking occupancy. The landlord and the tenant shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such listing, but shall not be construed to be conclusive to latent defects. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing, he shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which he dissents, and shall sign such statement of dissent.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> At the termination of occupancy, the landlord shall inspect the premises and compile a comprehensive listing of any damage to the unit which is the basis for any charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing such damage. The tenant shall then have the right to inspect the premises to ascertain the accuracy of such listing. The landlord and the tenant shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such listing. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing, he shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which he dissents, and shall sign such statement of dissent.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> No landlord shall be entitled to retain any portion of a security deposit if the security deposit was not deposited in a separate account as required by subsection (1) of this section and if the initial and final damage listings required by subsections (2) and (3) of this section are not provided.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> A tenant who disputes the accuracy of the final damage listing given pursuant to subsection (3) of this section may bring an action in District Court. Tenant’s claim shall be limited to those items from which the tenant specifically dissented in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, or except as otherwise provided, and if the tenant shall fail to sign the listing or specifically dissent in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, the tenant shall not be entitled to recover any damages under this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> In the event a tenant leaves not paying his last month’s rent and does not demand a return of his deposit, the landlord may, after thirty (30) days, remove the deposit from the account and apply any such excess to the debt owing.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> In the event the tenant leaves not owing rent and having any refund due, the landlord shall send notification to the last known or reasonably determinable address, of the amount of any refund due the tenant. In the event the landlord shall not have received a response from the tenant within sixty (60) days from the sending of such notification, the landlord may remove the deposit from the account and retain it free from any claim of the tenant or any person claiming in his behalf.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety;</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> If the landlord acts in violation of subsection (1) of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in KRS 383.655 and has a defense in any retaliatory action against him for possession. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within one (1) year before the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rent increase or diminution of services. “Presumption” means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence.</p>
