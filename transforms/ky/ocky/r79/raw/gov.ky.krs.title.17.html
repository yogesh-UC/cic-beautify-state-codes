<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Unreasonable Burden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the task of determining what materials were properly subject to an inmate’s open records request was tedious and time-consuming work, complying with the request did not automatically constitute an unreasonable burden. Regardless of the specificity of the open records request, the Department of Corrections personnel were still obligated to sift through any requested materials in order to determine which documents (or portions of a document) had to be redacted or excised by reasons of privacy or for institutional safety under KRS 197.025. Commonwealth v. Chestnut, 250 S.W.3d 655, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 116 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Winnowing process required of the Department of Corrections by the General Assembly under KRS 197.025 did not rise to the level of an unreasonable burden under KRS 61.872(6), especially in light of the fact that the General Assembly had already mandated that all public agencies had to separate materials exempted from disclosure in a document from materials that were subject to disclosure. The obvious fact that complying with an open records request would have consumed both time and manpower was, standing alone, not sufficiently clear and convincing evidence of an unreasonable burden.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate could not review the psychological evaluation contained in his medical file because this section, which is incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS 61.878(1)(j) (now 61.878(1)(l)), prohibits disclosure of records or information made confidential by enactment of the General Assembly, and precludes release of psychological evaluations pursuant to corrections cabinet policy and procedure. OAG 92-25.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Facilities operating under the jurisdiction of the cabinet may invoke this section when, in the exercise of their discretion, they conclude that release of a record may constitute a threat to the security of the inmate, another inmate, or the staff of the institution. OAG 92-26.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A correctional facility properly denied a request by an inmate for a copy of the facility’s lab certification as such certification did not pertain to the inmate making the request. OAG 99-ORD-15.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky State Penitentiary properly denied a request for records containing the names and home addresses of all penitentiary employees and the penitentiary’s master menu as such records did not pertain to the inmate himself. OAG 99-ORD-102.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A correctional facility properly denied an inmate’s request for copies of walk logs showing inmates on restricted privileges and for receipts for how much the penitentiary spent on cassette tapes for court call records since the inmate’s name did not appear on the requested records and he was not entitled to records of other inmates or records that did not pertain to him. OAG 99-ORD-188.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the presence of litigation and simultaneously filed open records and discovery requests may engender staff confusion, neither relieves a correctional facility of its duties under KRS 61.880(1) when read in conjunction with subsection (7) of this section. OAG 00-ORD-83.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A correctional facility properly denied an inmate’s request for, inter alia, records pertaining to disciplinary actions against employees of the facility as such records did not pertain to the inmate. OAG 00-ORD-83.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The custodian of the records office at a correctional institution could not selectively respond to only those requests for records over which she had personal custody and control and require an inmate to resubmit his requests to other departments within the institution as such other records were within the custody and control of the correctional institution on whose behalf she responded; the proper course would have been to confer with the open records coordinator, and possibly the deputy warden of security’s office and the medical department, in formulating the proper response to the inmate’s request and to have rerouted each portion of the request to the appropriate department that maintained the requested records, rather than requiring the inmate to resubmit his request to the different departments. OAG 99-ORD-157.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the incident reports at issue did not mention an inmate by name, he was prohibited from inspecting the records, even though he was affected by the incidents covered by the reports. OAG 99-ORD-157.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county division of community corrections did not violate the Open Records Act when it denied a request by an inmate for various records, including names of various persons on floors of a detention center, on the ground that such records did not specifically relate to the inmate. OAG 00-ORD-153.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county jailer properly denied a request for various records pertaining to the jail, including names and other information about jail employees and inmates housed in a certain dormitory, as such information did not specifically pertain to the inmate requesting the records and disclosure would have constituted a threat to their security as well as to the security of their families. OAG 00-ORD-182.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An inmate was not entitled to disclosure of raw data from psychological tests that were contained in his sexual offense treatment program file; access to those records was properly denied to prevent the dissemination of the test and data to other inmates prior to their taking the examination and because the inmate was not qualified to utilize or interpret the information. OAG 00-ORD-204.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although neither KRS 197.025 nor KRS 197.400 et seq. invests a participant in the sexual offender treatment program with an unfettered right of access to all records in his treatment file, neither statute establishes an absolute bar to his access. As in all matters pertaining to records access, it is incumbent on the agencies to identify all records in the file that were withheld, and to articulate a basis for denying him access to them in terms of the requirements of the Open Records Act. If no legally defensible basis exists for denying the offender access to the other records in his file, these agencies are obligated to disclose them to him. OAG 00-ORD-221.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A correctional facility properly denied an inmate’s request for a copy of 501 KAR 6:080 since that administrative regulation does not pertain to the inmate, and because the correctional facility did not possess a copy of that adminstrative regulation. OAG 01-ORD-5.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the Open Records Law, and in particular KRS 61.880, contains no statute of limitations for initiating open records appeals, KRS 197.025(3) requires inmates confined in penal facilities to initiate an appeal of “any denial of an open record” with the Attorney General within twenty days. OAG 02-ORD-54.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>BCFC properly denied the inmate’s request for a copy of the memorandum outlining changes in work programs for inmates diagnosed with Hepatitis, notwithstanding the fact that he has been diagnosed with this illness, because that memorandum does not specifically reference him. OAG 03-ORD-73.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Fayette County Detention Center properly denied an inmate’s request for copies of various contracts with outside vendors, because the contracts do not specifically reference him. OAG 03-ORD-74.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 197.025(2) applies to bar the request of a non-convicted federal pre-trial inmate being held for the U.S. Marshals in a county jail for records related to the jail commissary. OAG 03-ORD-150.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Correctional Complex properly relied upon KRS 197.025(1) in its denial of the request for copies of the entry/exit logs, the daily rosters for the security staff, the duty rosters, and the time and attendance records for the security staff. Disclosure of the documents would pose a threat to the security of the institution because disclosure of these records could enable a requester to determine (1) when posts filled by these individuals were either unmanned or in a state of change; and (2) when these individuals may be found in close proximity to the institution for purposes of harassment. OAG 04-ORD-180.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 197.025(2) necessarily applies to Corrections Corporation of America. Although the statute does not specifically provide that private providers such as CCA and facilities under its jurisdiction are not required to comply with such requests, to hold otherwise would yield the absurd result that inmates housed at private correctional facilities under the jurisdiction of CCA or other private providers would be able to access records which inmates housed at state facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections are unable to access. OAG 04-ORD-205.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where sufficient objective indicia exist to establish an identity of purpose between an inmate and a non-inmate, the attorney general will not require disclosure of records to the latter, thereby undermining the purpose for which KRS 197.025(2) was enacted. In this case, objective indicia exist to establish an “identity of purpose” between an inmate and the requester, namely, the Power of Attorney and the postal money orders from the inmate to the Kentucky State Treasurer. OAG 04-ORD-214.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an inmate receives a disciplinary report for unauthorized use of drugs, and receives a copy of the internal chain of custody form for collection of the urine sample and the laboratory chain of custody forms, to the extent the back pages of original urinalysis chain of custody documentation contains information that is not addressed to or does not specifically refer to an inmate, the Department of Corrections is authorized to except those pages from disclosure to inmates under KRS 61.878(1)(l) and KRS 197.025(2). OAG 04-ORD-248.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Department of Corrections may properly withhold the requested personnel record of a deputy warden on the basis of KRS 197.025(1) assuming it satisfies its burden of proof by establishing that disclosure would constitute a threat to the security of any inmate, the staff of the institution, or any other person, and promptly notifies the requester in writing of its decision. OAG 05-ORD-34.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A correctional facility did not violate the Open Records Act in its denial of an inmate’s request to inspect his psychological file — mainly the psychological evaluation. OAG 05-ORD-101.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lee Adjustment Center properly denied a request to inspect the records regarding the firing of an officer on the basis of KRS 197.025(1) or, in the alternative, KRS 197.025(2), both of which are incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS 61.878(1)(l). OAG 05-ORD-143.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Correctional institution did not violate the Open Records Act in denying an inmate access to “still frame pictures . . .from basement control camera” within the institution because photographs created from the camera would show areas where it was capable of focusing and blind spots outside its range and it would be impossible for the institution to redact the photographs and eliminate the security concern. OAG 06-ORD-005.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In responding to the request of an inmate for copies of “all statements/occu[rrence] reports made by any medical dep[artment] employees ” regarding his confinement in segregation, a correctional institution properly relied upon KRS 197.025(1) in redacting the name of a medical staff member who provided a statement that was incorporated into a report concerning the incident.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The application of the additional requirements imposed by subsection (4) for earning credit toward parole for good behavior to a defendant who committed third degree sodomy prior to the effective date of the statute was not unconstitutional as an improper ex post facto application of the statute. Lozier v. Commonwealth, 32 S.W.3d 511, 2000 Ky. App. LEXIS 33 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although statutory law permitted a trial court to grant an inmate sentence credits under certain circumstances, the trial court erred in finding that it was required to give the inmate credit on the inmate’s Kentucky sentence for the time the inmate served on a Missouri sentence imposed on the inmate while the inmate was on parole from the inmate’s Kentucky sentence since a Kentucky parolee was not entitled to credit for the time spent on parole from a sentence. Kassulke v. Briscoe-Wade, 105 S.W.3d 403, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 44 (Ky. 2003), modified, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. June 12, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment was properly granted to prison psychologists, a guard, and the parole board members because even assuming that a good-time credit statute was retroactively applied to a prisoner, there would not have been an ex post facto violation because its application would not have increased the prisoner’s punishment beyond his original sentence. Froman v. Peterson, 74 Fed. Appx. 484, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 16479 (6th Cir. Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an inmate<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>alleged that the Department of Corrections improperly denied a petition to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>enter a KRS 197.045 sex offender treatment program, the inmate alleged the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sort of constitutional tort that was subject to a one-year limitations period;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because the inmate’s reapplications were essentially requests to reconsider<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the initial decision, the trial court properly determined that KRS 418.040<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>et seq. applied, and that the declaratory action was untimely under KRS 413.140. Tyler v. Taylor, 128 S.W.3d 495, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 304 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 197.045(4) was applied retrospectively in an inmate’s case, as the statute was passed after the inmate’s initial conviction and sentence, the statute’s requirement of the inmate successfully completing the Sex Offender Treatment Program for the inmate’s eligibility to earn discretionary good time credits towards his subsequent concurrently running sentences following two (2) later convictions for sexual offenses, was not an increase in punishment prohibited by the ex post facto clause. Martin v. Chandler, 122 S.W.3d 540, 2003 Ky. LEXIS 265 (Ky. 2003).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a chain of custody of a urinalysis was not flawed, an inmate’s loss of good-time credits for unauthorized drug use was not a violation of due process; the inmate received all due process to which the inmate was entitled.

Ann. § 532.120 to define the way multiple consecutive sentences are to be summed into an aggregate, a single whole or total formed by combining several elements, the General Assembly made clear its intent that the several consecutive sentences imposed in a judgment be viewed as a single unit. Thus, a violent offender confined under consecutive sentences must be regarded as undergoing a single, continuous term of confinement, which is satisfied by discharge of that unit of time, rather than a series of distinct, independent terms. Without authority in either the general sentencing statute or Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 197.047 for unpacking an aggregate sentence, neither the Kentucky Department of Corrections nor the courts are at liberty to do so. Ky. Dep't of Corr. v. Dixon, 572 S.W.3d 46, 2019 Ky.

Ann. § 197.047(6)(b) applies to a prisoner serving a violent-offense sentence rather than to the sentence for that specific violent offense, i.e., the emphasis is on any inmate serving a violent offender sentence. Nothing in the work-credit statute authorizes a violent offender serving an aggregate sentence for both violent and nonviolent crimes to have his sentence partitioned into violent and nonviolent portions, just as nothing in the general sentencing statute allows such breaking of an aggregate sentence into discrete parts.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although neither KRS 197.025 nor KRS 197.400 et seq. invests a participant in the sexual offender treatment program with an unfettered right of access to all records in his treatment file, neither statute establishes an absolute bar to his access. As in all matters pertaining to records access, it is incumbent on the agencies to identify all records in the file that were withheld, and to articulate a basis for denying him access to them in terms of the requirements of the Open Records Act. If no legally defensible basis exists for denying the offender access to the other records in his file, these agencies are obligated to disclose them to him. OAG 00-ORD-221.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The communications at issue were made in the application of or in the course of diagnosis and treatment in the Sexual Offender Treatment Program consisting of factual admissions relating to the offense for which the defendant was convicted in October 1989 that he made to employees of the Department assigned to the SOTP. These communications therefore fall squarely within the parameters of the privilege contained in KRS 197.440 and access under the Open Records Act was properly denied. Moreover, the communications did not, at the time they were made, relate to an ongoing criminal investigation within the meaning of KRS 197.440. OAG 03-ORD-39.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that as a result of the spread of slum conditions and blight to formerly sound urban and rural neighborhoods and as a result of actions involving highways, public facilities and urban renewal activities there exists in the Commonwealth a serious shortage of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing available at prices or rentals which can be afforded by persons and families of lower and moderate income. This shortage is severe in certain urban areas of the state, is especially critical in the rural areas, and is inimical to the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of all residents of the Commonwealth and to the sound growth of Kentucky communities.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that private enterprise and investment have not been able to produce, without assistance, the needed construction of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing at low prices or rentals which persons and families of lower and moderate income can afford, or to achieve the urgently needed rehabilitation of much of the present supply of residential housing available for persons and families of lower and moderate income. It is imperative that the supply of residential housing for persons and families of lower and moderate income affected by the spread of slum conditions and blight and for persons and families of lower and moderate income displaced by public actions or natural disaster be increased; and that private enterprise and investment be encouraged to sponsor, build and rehabilitate residential housing for such persons and families, to help prevent the recurrence of slum conditions and blight and assist in their permanent elimination throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that the purposes of this chapter are to provide financing for development costs, land development and residential housing construction, new or rehabilitated, for sale or rental to persons and families of lower and moderate income.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that in accomplishing this purpose, the Kentucky Housing Corporation shall be and constitute a de jure municipal corporation and political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Kentucky created for the performance of essential public functions and the serving of public purposes in improving and promoting the health, welfare and prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky by the production of residential housing.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> All residential mortgage loans made as required by this section shall comply with the applicable provisions of the laws of the state, and, where federal law or the law of another jurisdiction governs the affairs of the mortgage lender with the applicable provisions of such law.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> The corporation may require agreement by any mortgage lender as a condition of the loan to such mortgage lender, to the payment of penalties to the corporation for violation by the mortgage lender of any provision of this section or its undertaking to the corporation with respect to the making of residential mortgage loans, and such penalties shall be recoverable at the demand of the corporation.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> If at any time the corporation shall determine that an adequate supply of funds exists in regular banking channels for residential mortgage loans, the corporation shall discontinue the making of loans to mortgage lenders until such time as the corporation may subsequently determine that the supply of funds available for new residential mortgage loans is again inadequate.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1) of this section will not prevent a city from amending its electrical code after March 28, 1978, to provide standards more stringent than the National Electrical Code, which standards will continue in effect until such time as the Uniform State Building Code becomes mandatory within the city. OAG 79-579.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The City of Louisville cannot adopt a building code ordinance, the terms of which are more stringent than those found in the state uniform building code. OAG 80-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No constitutional or statutory incompatibility would exist where an individual is employed full-time as the building inspector for one city and at the same time serves as a part-time building inspector for a city which does not have sufficient work in that field to justify hiring a full-time inspector. OAG 80-232.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although local governments are responsible for the enforcement of the state building code within the boundaries of their jurisdictions, the department of local government may participate in the local enforcement program to the extent of providing funds for the research and planning of a program whereby various local governments will jointly conduct and operate an enforcement program. (Decision prior to 1982 enactment of KRS 147A.021.) OAG 82-312.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Local enforcement of the National Electrical Code is contemplated. OAG 83-32.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the duty and responsibility of the municipal government to employ its own certified inspectors or to enter into an interlocal agreement with another governmental entity, utilizing the inspectors of that entity, to conduct the required inspections and the statutes do not contemplate free lance certified electrical inspectors contracting directly with the owners or occupiers of houses and other buildings to conduct electrical inspections; now that the Kentucky Building Code is mandatorily effective in the state, the enforcement of the Code within a city, including the National Electrical Code which is part of the Kentucky Building Code, is the responsibility of the city. OAG 83-32.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A house or other building subject to the requirements of the National Electrical Code and located within the municipal limits is not eligible to receive a hookup to an electric source and electric service from an electric utility until it has been inspected by a certified electrical inspector authorized to perform electrical inspections for the city; thus, a city was not required to connect power to a structure approved by a certified inspector other than the city inspector nor could the head of the city light and water department, without approval of the city’s legislative body, approve a hookup to a structure within the city limits which was inspected by someone other than the city inspector. OAG 83-32.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no authority for an inspector to make “in the field” changes. OAG 84-47.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an inspector for a local government has utilized the concurrent jurisdiction concept relative to inspections and has uncovered a problem serious enough to warrant the use of a stop work order, that inspector should proceed in the same manner as a state inspector would have had the state inspector decided such course of action was appropriate. OAG 84-47.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While concurrent jurisdiction relative to inspections exists, neither state nor local inspectors should utilize the right and responsibility indiscriminately and as often as is practicable, inspectors should confine their inspections to those buildings over which their employing governments have the plan review responsibility. However, in those situations where serious problems exist or where it is thought that serious problems might exist, an inspector of a local government could inspect a building over which the state has the plan review responsibility rather than waiting for the state inspector to address the matter. OAG 84-47.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The local government’s inspectors could inspect a building over which the state has the plan review responsibility; the concurrent jurisdiction concept with regard to inspections is an attempt by the General Assembly to protect lives and property in that any qualified state or local inspector may inspect a building, particularly where a serious problem has been reported or where a serious problem is suspected and, in this way, the problem can be corrected and difficulties prevented as soon as a qualified inspector arrives rather than having to wait for a particular inspector to arrive.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Cabinet for Human Resources (now Cabinet for Health and Family Services) established the defendants’ abuse and neglect of their older daughter by clear and convincing evidence and that the pattern of sexual abuse occurring with the older daughter could well repeat itself with the younger children, such possibility did not constitute clear and convincing evidence of abuse and neglect with respect to the younger children. O.B.C. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 705 S.W.2d 954, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1048 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court has a great deal of discretion to determine whether a child fits within the abused or neglected category and whether the abuse or neglect warrants termination of parental rights, but, in deciding to terminate parental rights, the court must state specifically the facts which justify its decision.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Department for Human Resources (now Cabinet for Health and Family Services) need not prove child abuse by the parents before parental rights can be involuntarily terminated. Bryant v. Kentucky Dep't for Human Resources, 548 S.W.2d 165, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 648 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a child suffered injuries for which the parents delayed or neglected to seek medical attention it was a “neglected child” within the meaning of this section so that trial court’s decision in directing involuntary termination of parental rights was sustained.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given the serious nature of depriving a parent of all rights to his child, as well as the fact that the alleged neglect appeared to have involved specific isolated events in the past, the trial court in a termination case previously tried under the “preponderance of evidence” standard must retry the case applying the new “clear and convincing” standard of proof to the provisions of KRS 199.603 (now repealed) and this section. H. v. Department for Human Resources, 642 S.W.2d 600, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 269 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where neither parent worked on a regular basis, neither parent appeared to have employment skills or the motivation to obtain those skills, the father became violent when angry, neither parent would admit to the sexual abuse of the older daughter, and both parents blamed the older daughter for initiating the sexual contact, the termination of the defendants’ parental rights with respect to the younger children was supported by clear and convincing evidence. O.B.C. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 705 S.W.2d 954, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1048 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the children’s health was unquestionably harmed when they were allowed to be hungry and unclothed, to run around with infected wounds, and to have obvious serious physical conditions go undetected and untreated, the trial court had no choice but to find abuse and neglect exercised upon these children by their respective parents and the court did not terminate parental rights on the basis of poverty alone. V.S. v. Commonwealth, Cabinet for Human Resources, 706 S.W.2d 420, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1069 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Generally, abandonment is demonstrated by facts or circumstances that evince a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child; nonsupport does not itself constitute abandonment, especially where the child is supported by a volunteer, but it may be an element of abandonment. O.S. v. C.F., 655 S.W.2d 32, 1983 Ky. App. LEXIS 334 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> From the closest telephone available, the same employee shall alert the state building administrator or the person designated in the state building’s “Code Adam” plan, who shall then notify the occupants of the state building through the loudspeaker system or through any other fast and effective means of communication that “Code Adam” has been activated;</p>

In addition, two (2) or more employees, as may be necessary, shall be assigned to search the parking areas of the state building. This process shall not entail the closing or locking of any door of the state building;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Any child, or person with a child, leaving the state building shall be asked to go through the main exit previously designated by the administrator.

Employees who are directly serving a member of the public at that time and employees who have been previously excluded by the administrator shall not be compelled to participate in the search;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> If the minor is not found within a ten (10) minute period, the state building administrator shall notify a state or local law enforcement agency that a child is lost or missing and provide the information then known about the lost or missing child.

The law enforcement agency may request that the local search and rescue coordinator provide additional resources to search for the lost or missing child.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section requires that before the child can be adopted he must have been placed in the home for the purpose of adoption, the legislative policy of the state is that no child except as set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4) of this section is to be adopted unless he is first placed in the home for that purpose by the Department of Child Welfare (now Cabinet for Health and Family Services).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 199.470 merely set out stepparents, grandparents, sisters and brothers, and aunts and uncles by exempting them from the requirement that anyone seeking to adopt a child obtain written approval from the Secretary of the Cabinet, but did not attempt to define this group of individuals as “relatives” or by any other term; the regulations and policies of Kentucky Cabinet for Families and Children vested second cousins of an adoptive child with a sufficient, cognizable legal interest in the child’s adoption proceeding, and their motion to intervene should have been granted.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in granting a mother’s motion to dismiss a father’s petition to add the step-mother as the child’s step-parent for adoption and in denying the step-mother’s motion to alter, amend, or vacate said order because the adoption superseded the termination, and the Cabinet for Health and Family Services was not an indispensable party since the step-mother was a party to the amended petition.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action of trial court in permitting foster parents to amend their petition for termination of parental rights to one of adoption did not cure foster parent’s lack of standing to bring such termination action where the child had been placed in foster care under written contract which actually excluded adoption; moreover, since the child had not been placed for adoption as required by this section, the foster parents had no standing to attempt adoption. L.S.J. v. E.B., 672 S.W.2d 937, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 505 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).</p>

Further, under KRS 199.470(3), the grandparents could not petition to adopt the child because he had not resided continuously in their home for at least 90 days; because the grandparents could not satisfy this prerequisite, they lacked standing to go forward in an adoption proceeding.

Once the purely doctrinal question was answered by the ecclesiastical judicatory, the questions raised civilly by subsection (1) of KRS 344.020 and this section could be addressed by the civil judicatory.

<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Based on the report and recommendation of the adoption worker making the home study, the secretary shall grant or refuse permission for the applicant to place or receive a child as early as practicable, but, in any case, the decision shall be made within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the application. In reaching a decision, the secretary shall be guided by the ability of the persons wishing to receive the child to give the child a suitable home, and shall at all times consider the best interest of the child from a financial, medical, psychological, and psychiatric standpoint.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If the application is refused, the secretary shall in general terms furnish in writing the reasons for his or her refusal.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Any person who seeks temporary custody of a child prior to the secretary’s ruling on an application for adoption shall file a petition seeking temporary custody, with a notice of intent to adopt, with the Circuit Court that will have jurisdiction of the adoption proceedings. The clerk of the court shall send a notice of the filing of the petition to the cabinet. A hearing on the petition shall occur no later than seventy-two (72) hours after the filing of the petition, excluding weekends and holidays. Proceedings under this subsection shall be incorporated into the court’s adoption file. If the adoption is not finalized within six (6) months of the filing of the petition and notice of intent, the court shall conduct a hearing on the status and custody of the child.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> Upon a finding by the Circuit Court that the child should be placed prior to the secretary’s ruling on the application, the Circuit Court may grant the applicant temporary custody of the child pending the decision of the secretary. Temporary custody shall not be granted to an applicant unless a background check, including but not limited to a criminal records check by the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet or the Administrative Office of the Courts and a background check of child abuse and neglect records maintained by the cabinet, has been submitted to and reviewed by the court. The background check required for temporary custody shall be part of the home study required under subsection (2) of this section. If the application is denied by the secretary, the temporary custody order shall be set aside and, upon motion of the cabinet or of the child’s parent or parents, the Circuit Court may order the child returned to the biological parent or parents or the child’s custody may be awarded to the cabinet, another licensed child-placing agency, or other individuals deemed appropriate by the court. This section shall not be deemed to permit the completion of any adoption proceeding without the approval of the secretary and compliance with KRS 615.030, if required.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> In any case where the cabinet refuses to approve the placement of a child for adoption when requested by the parent or parents of the child, or refuses the request of any person or persons that a child be placed with that person or those persons for adoption, the decision of the secretary in so refusing shall be final unless within ten (10) days after notice of refusal, the biological or proposed adopting parent or parents shall appeal to the Circuit Court of the county in which the adoption is proposed. No placement shall be disapproved on the basis of the religious, ethnic, racial, or interfaith background of the adoptive applicant, if the placement is made with the consent of the parent.</p>

The cabinet may approve or deny the placement, in spite of the fact that the custodial parent or parents are unwilling to be interviewed by the cabinet or other approving entity, or if, after diligent efforts have been made, the adoption worker is unable to locate or interview the custodial parent or parents. The cabinet shall be made a party defendant to the appeal. In the hearing of an appeal, the court shall review the findings of the secretary and shall determine if the secretary has acted arbitrarily, unlawfully, or in a manner that constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(11)</b> If a child who does not fall within the exception provided for in KRS 199.470(4) is placed or received in a home without the court’s review of the background check required under this section or the permission of the secretary for health and family services, or if permission to receive a child has been denied, a representative of the cabinet shall notify in writing or may petition the juvenile session of District Court of the county in which the child is found setting out the facts concerning the child. When the petition has been filed, the court shall take jurisdiction of the child and shall provide for it as it would provide for a dependent, neglected, or abused child under KRS Chapter 620, except that the child may not be placed in the home of the applicants who are to receive the child unless permission to do so is granted by the secretary or the action is ordered by a Kentucky court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(12)</b> When either the custodial parent or parents of the child to be placed or the persons wishing to receive the child reside out-of-state, the requirement of KRS 615.030, Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall be met before the cabinet gives approval for the child’s placement.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(13)</b> The secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall be paid a nonrefundable fee of two hundred dollars ($200) upon the filing of the written application for permission to place or receive a child.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The policy of the voluntary termination statute, subsection (2) of KRS 199.601, (now repealed) and the consent to adoption statute, subsection (5) of this section, is to preserve to the mother her right of choice regardless of decisions made before the birth of the child. This policy was not violated by the existence of the contractual arrangements previously made by the surrogate mother to surrender custody and terminate parental rights because the law gives the mother the opportunity to reconsider her decision to fulfill the role as surrogate mother and refuse to perform the voluntary termination procedure. Surrogate Parenting Associates, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 704 S.W.2d 209, 1986 Ky. LEXIS 237 (Ky. 1986).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mother of illegitimate child could withdraw her consent to its adoption if sufficient reason is shown before final judgment. The fact that consent was given under circumstance of temporary distress or discouragement or that the mother was an infant was sufficient to establish the right to such withdrawal. Warner v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an attorney misinformed birth parents that they had until a hearing on the termination of parental rights to withdraw their consent to adoption, and where the birth parents relied upon that advice in signing consent forms, the forms were invalid; however, on remand the standard that applied in determining whether the birth parents or the adoptive parents had custody was the child’s best interest because the birth parents’ intentions to permanently change the legal custody of the child was clearly evident from their actions, including their signing the consent forms with the knowledge that the consent forms would facilitate the child’s adoption and delivering the child to the adoptive parents when placement was approved.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of a petition for the adoption of the child of a biological father who had not consented to the adoption was proper; there were no allegations set forth against the biological father which would have constituted a condition sufficient to terminate his parental rights as required by KRS 199.502(1), and which were the same conditions set forth in KRS 625.090(2); the provisions of KRS ch. 625 were applicable only as permitted by KRS 199.500(4), and as specifically enumerated in KRS 199.502. R.M. v. R.B., 281 S.W.3d 293, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 33 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in terminating a father’s parental rights based upon willful abandonment and allowing the child’s stepfather to adopt him because the record showed that the mother thwarted the father’s attempts to visit with his son, that the mother treated the father with hostility and resentment, that the mother and her new husband removed the child from Kentucky every Father’s Day, that the father asked his family members to keep in contact with his child and the mother admonished them to stay away from the child, and that the mother never informed the father about the child’s extracurricular activities. Despite the mother’s attempts to sever the parent-child relationship between father and son, however, the record also reflected that the father was current in his child support obligation and that he sent gifts to the boy. P.C.C. v. C.M.C., 297 S.W.3d 590, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 144 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in granting a mother’s motion to dismiss a father’s petition to add the step-mother as the child’s step-parent for adoption and in denying the step-mother’s motion to alter, amend, or vacate said order because the adoption superseded the termination, and the Cabinet for Health and Family Services was not an indispensable party since the step-mother was a party to the amended petition. E.K. v. T.A., 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 22 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2019), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 572 S.W.3d 80, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 32 (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no error in a trial court’s procedure in conducting an evidentiary hearing on an adoption petition and essentially permitting the presentation of a case for the involuntary termination of the nonconsenting biological father’s parental rights under KRS ch. 625 because the substantial provisions of KRS 625.090(2) pertaining to the involuntary termination of parental rights were identical to KRS 199.502(1). R.M. v. R.B., 281 S.W.3d 293, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 33 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court was not required to issue its interlocutory judgment within 30 days of the termination portion of the bifurcated hearing where Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 625.090(6) did not apply to actions brought under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 199.502. A.F. v. L.B., 572 S.W.3d 64, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 26 (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Petition Granted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Stepfather's adoption petition under this statute was granted because the trial court's order of termination was supported by the record where the biological father admitted that he had not been involved in the child's life and made no efforts to do so; the child was almost 5 years old and had not seen the biological father in three years. Although the father recently paid child support, he admitted that he had not paid in several years because he knew that other relatives were caring for the child. R.P. v. T.A.C., 469 S.W.3d 425, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 102 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although not much credence was given to the biological mother’s lack of financial support given her poverty and inability to work, adoption was appropriate where her testimony showed that for at least six months she had been substantially incapable of caring for the child, and there was no reasonable likelihood that she would be able to care for the child (or herself) any time in the reasonable future.

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> “State-funded adoption assistance” means a monthly payment to assist in meeting the special needs of a child which was placed by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The state-funded adoption assistance shall also include payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses, and may include reimbursement of extraordinary medical expenses.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> “Nonrecurring adoption expenses” means those expenses which are incurred in the legal adoption of a special-needs child for which parents are ultimately responsible which include reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the special-needs adoption and which are not incurred in violation of state or federal law.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> “Extraordinary medical expenses” means those expenses which are related to the child’s special needs which existed prior to the adoption and are not reimbursed by private insurance, Medicaid, or other third-party payors or government programs.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> If the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services or his designated representative finds that a child may benefit from being adopted and that a monthly assistance payment to adoptive parents after the adoption will increase the likelihood of adoption, state funds may be paid to the adoptive parents after completion of the adoption of the child if the following conditions exist:</p>

The payments shall not exceed the amount which would be paid for foster care for the child. Monthly state-funded assistance payments shall not exceed the amount which would be paid for foster care for the child and may include reimbursement for extraordinary medical expenses. Payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses shall only be reimbursed up to the limit established by the secretary for health and family services in accord with 42 U.S.C. sec. 673. However, payments under agreements entered into under subsection (6) of this section shall be limited to reimbursement of authorized extraordinary medical expenses related to problems or conditions that existed prior to the adoption.</p>

The Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall furnish to the clerks of the Circuit Courts the necessary forms to carry out the provisions of this section. If the child was born in another state, the order of adoption shall be forwarded to the division of vital statistics of the state concerned to be changed in accordance with the laws of such state. If the child was born in a foreign country, the report of adoption shall be returned to the attorney or agency handling the adoption for submission to the appropriate federal agency.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> At the time the biological parents give up the child for adoption, they shall be asked by the cabinet whether they consent to the inspection of the adoption records, to personal contact by the child, or to both when he becomes an adult. If consent is then given, it can later be revoked. If consent is withheld at that time, the biological parents may give consent at any later time. The initial written statement of consent or refusal of consent to inspection of records and personal contact shall be filed with the Circuit Court not later than the date of finalization of the adoption proceedings. When a written consent is on file, the records shall be available to the adult adopted person, upon his request therefor in writing.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> When any adult adopted person applies in person or in writing to the Circuit Court for authorization to inspect all papers and records pertaining to the adoption proceedings of that adult adopted person as provided in KRS 199.570(1), and the biological parents have previously refused consent to inspection of records and to personal contact, the court may, if satisfied as to the identity of the adult adopted person, authorize the adult adopted person to inspect the papers and records if written consent is obtained from the biological parents identified on the adult adopted person’s original birth certificate.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The Circuit Court shall, within seven (7) working days of the receipt of the request, direct the secretary of the cabinet to notify each biological parent identified on the adult adopted person’s original birth certificate that the person has applied to the court for information identifying the biological parent. Within six (6) months of receiving the notice of the request of the adult adopted person, the secretary of the cabinet shall make complete and reasonable efforts to notify each biological parent identified on the adult adopted person’s original birth certificate. The secretary may charge a reasonable fee not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250) to the adult adopted person for making this search. Every child-caring facility and child-placing agency in the Commonwealth shall cooperate with the secretary in his efforts to notify these biological parents.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If the cabinet utilizes the services of another person or entity to perform a search under subsection (3) of this section, the cabinet shall enter into a formal contract with that person or entity. A person or entity contracted to perform a search shall be licensed under the provisions of KRS Chapter 329A.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The notification of the biological parents shall not be by mail and shall be by personal and confidential contact by the cabinet. The notification shall be done without disclosing the identity of the adult adopted person. The personal and confidential contact with the biological parents shall be evidenced by filing with the Circuit Court an affidavit of notification executed by the person who notified each parent and certifying each parent was given the following information:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The nature of the information requested by the adult adopted person;</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> The adult adopted person shall not be authorized to inspect the papers and records pertaining to his or her adoption proceedings unless those biological parents identified on the original birth certificate agree in writing to that inspection.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> If after diligent and reasonable effort, the secretary of the cabinet certifies that both biological parents identified in the original birth certificate are deceased or the secretary is unable to locate said parents, then a judge of the Circuit Court, upon motion of the adult adopted person, may order that all papers and records of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and those of the Circuit Court pertaining to the adoption shall be open for inspection to the adult adopted person. In any case, the court shall order that only identifying information about the biological parents be shared with the adult adopted person.</p>

<p class="p10">There is established in the State Treasury a fund to be known as the “Early Childhood Development Fund.” This fund shall exist for the purpose of receipt and expenditure of moneys to improve and promote early childhood development for children of the Commonwealth. The fund may receive state appropriations, gifts, grants, and federal funds and shall be disbursed by the State Treasurer upon the warrant of the chair of the early childhood development board. Beginning July 1, 2000, twenty-five percent (25%) of the proceeds from the tobacco settlement agreement fund shall be deposited in this fund as provided under KRS 248.654. All investment income earned from moneys deposited in the fund shall accrue to the fund. The moneys in the fund shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year but shall be carried forward in the next fiscal year for the purpose of the fund. The board shall develop and oversee the implementation of a strategic plan. The strategic plan shall identify both short-term and long-term goals and the appropriate oversights to measure progress toward achievement of those goals, and it shall be updated every two (2) years. The board shall submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislative Research Commission by September 1 of each year for the preceding fiscal year, outlining its activities and expenditures. The Auditor of Public Accounts, on an annual basis, shall conduct a thorough review of all expenditures from the fund and, if necessary in the opinion of the Auditor, an audit of the operations of the fund. No money in the fund shall be allocated until the board has adopted a strategic plan.</p>

<p class="p10">The Kentucky General Assembly finds that services to children and transition-age youth are provided by various departments and agencies at both the state and local level, often without appropriate policy collaboration and service coordination. The General Assembly declares that the purpose of KRS 200.501 to 200.509 is to establish a structure for coordinated policy development, comprehensive planning, and collaborative budgeting for services and supports to children and transition-age youth with or at risk of developing behavioral health needs and their families. It is further the intention of the General Assembly to build on the existing resources and to design and implement a system of care for children and transition-age youth with or at risk of developing behavioral health needs that is community-based, family- and youth-driven, and culturally and linguistically competent. Children and transition-age youth who meet criteria for a serious emotional disability, including a co-occurring substance use disorder, and who are placed outside their homes to address unmet behavioral health needs shall be given priority for services and supports pursuant to KRS 200.501 to 200.509.</p>

<p class="p7">(6/25/2013). In codification, a reference to the Early Childhood Business Council has been removed from the list in this statute of agencies the Department of Education must provide staffing and administrative support to because the statute creating the Early Childhood Business Council (KRS 200.709) was repealed in 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 57, sec. 10. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).</p>

<p class="p7">(6/25/2013). A reference to the “Early Childhood Development Authority” in this statute has been changed in codification to the “Early Childhood Advisory Council” to reflect the reorganization of certain parts of the Executive Branch, as set forth in Executive Order 2012-586 and confirmed by the General Assembly in 2013 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though there are significant differences between the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, that does not erase the principle that mentally ill persons and mentally retarded persons are in similar positions: each has a fundamental constitutional right not to be placed in an institution until a judicial hearing has taken place and appropriate findings have been made that they pose a danger, or threat of danger, to self or others, and have met the other requirements set out in the statutes; therefore this chapter violates the equal protection clause and is unconstitutional in not providing a mentally retarded person 18 years or older a judicial hearing prior to his or her involuntary commitment. Doe v. Austin, 668 F. Supp. 597, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17426 (W.D. Ky. 1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there is no rational basis for distinguishing between the mentally ill and the mentally retarded with regard to a judicial determination of their eligibility for civil commitment, equal protection requires the Commonwealth to provide a judicial hearing to the mentally retarded, either upon admission, or, if now committed, when they reach adulthood. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process does not require a periodic judicial review over the course of commitment of the mentally retarded. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process does not require that adults who are involuntarily committed are entitled to a judicial hearing; although, as a matter of policy, precommitment review by a judicial officer would ensure the most vigorous protection of the mentally retarded and thus might be preferable, it has been noted in a variety of situations that due process does not require that the neutral trier of fact be legally trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process requires that mentally retarded adults in this Commonwealth receive: written notice that a transfer to a hospital is being considered, a hearing, an opportunity at the hearing to present testimony of witnesses and to confront and cross-examine witnesses, an independent decisionmaker, a written statement by the factfinder, and qualified and independent assistance. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The current procedure for the involuntary commitment of mentally retarded adults does not conform with due process because there is no formal mechanism for providing notice and no method of assuring that the adequacy of notice is related to the time which the potential admittee would require to prepare for the hearing; there is no procedure whereby the admittee may present witnesses or documentary evidence, nor is there a clear opportunity for cross-examination; no independent assistance is allowed; and the parent or guardian of the person to be committed is allowed to be a member of the interdisciplinary team, which poses a serious threat to impartiality. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no legitimate interest of the Commonwealth which would justify denying the mentally retarded periodic judicial review while providing the same to the mentally ill; therefore, equal protection requires that the Commonwealth make a judicial review procedure available to the mentally retarded. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky’s lower standard of proof for the involuntary commitment of those alleged to be mentally retarded than of those alleged to be mentally ill did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the statutory distinctions were rationally based on the premise that mental retardation is easier to diagnose than mental illness and that a “dangerousness” determination is more accurate as to the mentally retarded than the mentally ill. Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 4397 (U.S. 1993).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to the periodic review of the commitment of mentally retarded persons 18 years or older, there must be some judicial review, at some appropriate time, of the commitment of such persons.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process requires that mentally retarded adults in this Commonwealth receive: written notice that a transfer to a hospital is being considered, a hearing, an opportunity at the hearing to present testimony of witnesses and to confront and cross-examine witnesses, an independent decisionmaker, a written statement by the factfinder, and qualified and independent assistance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process does not require that adults who are involuntarily committed are entitled to a judicial hearing; although, as a matter of policy, precommitment review by a judicial officer would ensure the most vigorous protection of the mentally retarded and thus might be preferable, it has been noted in a variety of situations that due process does not require that the neutral trier of fact be legally trained or a judicial or administrative officer.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The current procedure for the involuntary commitment of mentally retarded adults does not conform with due process because there is no formal mechanism for providing notice and no method of assuring that the adequacy of notice is related to the time which the potential admittee would require to prepare for the hearing; there is no procedure whereby the admittee may present witnesses or documentary evidence, nor is there a clear opportunity for cross-examination; no independent assistance is allowed; and the parent or guardian of the person to be committed is allowed to be a member of the interdisciplinary team, which poses a serious threat to impartiality.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no legitimate interest of the Commonwealth which would justify denying the mentally retarded periodic judicial review while providing the same to the mentally ill; therefore, equal protection requires that the Commonwealth make a judicial review procedure available to the mentally retarded.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky’s lower standard of proof for the involuntary commitment of those alleged to be mentally retarded than of those alleged to be mentally ill did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the statutory distinctions were rationally based on the premise that mental retardation is easier to diagnose than mental illness and that a “dangerousness” determination is more accurate as to the mentally retarded than the mentally ill.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute was enacted to aid “needy” children under 18 whose parents are incapacitated from supporting them. Barnes v. Neal, 287 S.W.2d 419, 1956 Ky. LEXIS 455 (Ky. 1956).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The test is the employability of the parent and not availability of employment, and general conditions of unemployment do not furnish a basis for such aid. Barnes v. Turner, 280 S.W.2d 185, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 139 (Ky. 1955) (decision prior to 1962 amendment).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Incapacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “incapacity” should be interpreted in accordance with the general spirit and purpose of the statute to provide a minimum subsistence for children deprived of parental support. Barnes v. Turner, 280 S.W.2d 185, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 139 (Ky. 1955) (decision prior to 1962 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Incapacity of a parent under regulations governing aid to dependent children means that which in fact renders the man unemployable in the community of his residence. Dawson v. Driver, 420 S.W.2d 553, 1967 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 1967).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Parental Support.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute contemplates that the parent must assume the burden of supporting his children if he is physically capable of so doing through any kind of legitimate endeavor, and that he may not pass the burden to the state merely because there are some limitations upon his ability to compete freely in the labor market. Barnes v. Turner, 280 S.W.2d 185, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 139 (Ky. 1955).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the father had his right leg amputated below the knee and suffered from a duodenal ulcer, but could perform some manual labor, his children did not qualify for aid under this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Federal earned income credit is a money grant to poor working families with dependent children, and it therefore fits within the definition of “public assistance” and is exempt under KRS 205.220(3) during federal bankruptcy proceedings. In re Goldsberry, 142 B.R. 158, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 1056 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>7. Public Assistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Debtor’s 1994 earned income credit constitutes “public assistance” for the purposes of subsection (3) of this section. KRS 205.220(3) and bankruptcy trustee’s objection to debtor’s claimed exemption was overruled. In re Brown, 186 B.R. 224, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 1277 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In its child support calculation, the Family Court properly excluded from income, as a means-tested public assistance program under KRS 403.212(2)(b), the earned income tax credit (EIC) received by the mother because the EIC was a money grant to assist needy families, the amount of which decreased as the taxpayer’s earnings increased. Brausch v. Brausch, 265 S.W.3d 837, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 279 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mother received an additional child tax credit, the credit was not within the parameters of a means-tested public assistance program under KRS 403.212(2)(b) because the additional child tax credit began to phaseout only when a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income reached $110,000 in the case of a joint return, and a family earning $110,000 per year was not “needy” as that term was commonly understood and used in KRS 205.010. Brausch v. Brausch, 265 S.W.3d 837, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 279 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Any applicant or recipient who is dissatisfied with the decision or delay in action on his application for public assistance or the amount granted to him may appeal to a hearing officer, except that an appeal and a hearing need not be granted if the sole issue is a federal or state law requiring an automatic change adversely affecting some or all recipients of the Kentucky medical assistance program so long as advance notice of the change, with an explanation of appeal rights, is provided to all affected recipients. However, a recipient may appeal whether the cabinet is accurately interpreting a change in federal or state law which may adversely affect the recipient. On receipt of an appeal, an administrative hearing shall be conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The secretary may appoint an Appeal Board for Public Assistance composed of the secretary and two (2) other members. The secretary shall be chairman, and he and one (1) other member constitute a quorum.</p>

The board may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision of a hearing officer on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in the case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the parties to the decision to initiate further appeals before it. The board may remove itself or transfer to another hearing officer the proceedings on any appeal pending before a hearing officer. The board shall promptly notify the parties to any proceedings of its findings and decisions.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The manner in which appeals are presented and hearings and appeals conducted under subsection (4) of this section shall be in accordance with administrative regulations promulgated by the secretary.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The cabinet shall fund, directly or through a contracting entity or entities, in each district, a program of essential services which shall have as its primary purpose the prevention of unnecessary institutionalization of functionally impaired elderly persons. The cabinet may use funds appropriated under this section to contract with public and private agencies, long-term care facilities, local governments, and other providers to provide core and essential services. The cabinet may provide core and essential services when such services cannot otherwise be purchased.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> In providing essential services, all existing community resources available to functionally impaired elderly persons shall be utilized. Additional services may be provided, but shall not be funded from funds appropriated under this section. Volunteers may be used where practicable to provide essential services to functionally impaired elderly persons. The cabinet or contracting entity shall provide or arrange for the provision of training and supervision of volunteers to ensure the delivery of quality services. The cabinet or contracting entity shall provide or arrange for appropriate insurance coverage to protect volunteers from personal liability while acting within the scope of their volunteer duties. In providing essential services under this section, the cabinet shall provide services to meet the needs of the minority elderly as identified by the cabinet pursuant to KRS 205.201.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Entities contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services under KRS 205.455 and this section shall provide a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the funding necessary for the support of program operations. No local match is required for assessment and case management. Local contributions, whether materials, commodities, transportation, office space, personal services, or other types of facilities services, or funds may be evaluated and counted toward the fifteen percent (15%) local funding requirements.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> When possible, funding for core services may be obtained under:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The Comprehensive Annual Social Services Program plan under Title XX of the Social Security Act;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The Medical Assistance Plan under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act;</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Providers contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services shall be responsible for the collection of fees and contributions for services in accordance with administrative regulations promulgated by the cabinet. Providers are authorized to assess and collect fees for services rendered in accordance with those administrative regulations. To help pay for essential services received, a functionally impaired elderly person shall pay an amount of money based on an overall ability to pay in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the cabinet. Fees shall reflect the degree to which the cabinet or contracting entity uses volunteers in the provision of services. Where essential services are provided by volunteers, fees shall only be assessed in an amount that will cover the cost of materials and other goods used in the provision of services. The cost of materials and other goods used by volunteers shall be reasonably similar to the cost of goods when paid personnel are used. Fees shall not be required of any person who is “needy aged” as defined in KRS 205.010; however, voluntary contributions may be encouraged. This subsection shall not apply to programs utilizing federal funds when administrative regulations require contributions to revert to the original funding source.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reduction in a the reimbursement rate for a psychiatric children's hospital was arbitrary and erroneous because the methodology was not based on a calculation specifically related to similar psychiatric hospitals, as statutorily required, in that a rate reducing methodology from clinically dissimilar acute care hospitals was used to calculate reimbursement rates. Moreover, a minimum occupancy adjustment to the Medicaid reimbursement from the costs shown on the hospital's reports had no relation to the hospital's cost of providing services. N. Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the words “relate to” are not defined by Ky. Rev. Stat.

Instead, the budget neutrality adjustments made by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, as outlined in 907 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:825, are arbitrary as they are partially based on historical costs, not actual costs. While the Cabinet can make downward adjustments that are rationally related to objective criteria like efficiency and economy, it cannot simply make arbitrary adjustments based on historical rates.

The BNA also violated federal law as its suppression of Medicaid reimbursement rates into percentages in the 70’s fell outside the range of what was reasonable and adequate. Because the BNA violated state and federal law, the imposition of it on Medicaid reimbursement rates was arbitrary and an abuse of administrative powers. Commonwealth v.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> An interstate lien may be created and a notice of interstate lien may be filed on all of an obligor’s real and personal property that is located in another state to enforce a child support obligation which has been judicially or administratively established in the Commonwealth. The lien shall be filed in the appropriate offices of the state or county where the property of the obligor is located. All aspects of the lien, including its priority and enforcement, are governed by the law of the state where the property is located and shall remain until released by the authorized agent of the party which filed the lien, or in accordance with the laws of the state of filing.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> A lien to enforce a child support obligation which is created in another state shall be enforceable against all real and personal property of the obligor located in this state upon the filing of a notice of interstate lien with the county clerk of any county or counties in which the obligor has interest in property, and the notice shall be recorded in the same manner as notices of lis pendens. The recordation shall constitute notice of both the original amount of child support due and all subsequent amounts due by the same obligor. Upon request, an authorized agent of the party which filed the notice of interstate lien shall disclose the specific amount of liability to any interested party legally entitled to that information. The notice, when so filed, shall be conclusive notice to all persons of the lien on the property having legal situs in that county. The lien shall commence as to property of the obligor located in the Commonwealth at the time the notice is filed and shall continue until the original amount of child support due and any subsequent amounts, including interest, penalties, or fees, are fully paid. The lien shall attach to all interest in the real and personal property in the Commonwealth, then owned or subsequently acquired by the obligor. The clerk shall be entitled to a fee pursuant to KRS 64.012 for filing the lien and the same fee for releasing the lien.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> A child support lien created in another state shall be on a parity with state, county, and municipal ad valorem tax liens, and superior to the lien of any mortgage or other encumbrance created after the notice of interstate lien is recorded; however, it shall be subordinate to any child support lien which has been filed by the cabinet as to the same obligor and property.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The authority by which the child support lien is created in another state and filed in this state shall be certified on the notice of interstate lien by a person who is authorized to certify on behalf of the party that is filing the notice of interstate lien.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidentiary hearing was required on defendant’s motion to withdraw a guilty plea because (1) defendant never had the chance to review the evidence, so a hearing was required to evaluate the soundness of counsel’s advice to plead guilty, and (2) KRS 209.020(8), (9), and (16) did not authorize the Commonwealth’s theory of guilt, as the Commonwealth said defendant had to force defendant’s mother to seek medical treatment despite the mother’s competence to refuse, and the mother consented to defendant’s withdrawals from the mother’s bank account.

<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Any representative of the cabinet may enter any health facility or health service licensed by the cabinet at any reasonable time to carry out the cabinet’s responsibilities under this chapter.

If the adult or caretaker does not consent to the investigation, a search warrant may be issued upon a showing of probable cause that an adult is being abused, neglected, or exploited, to enable a representative of the cabinet to proceed with the investigation.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> If a determination has been made that protective services are necessary when indicated by the investigation, the cabinet shall provide such services within budgetary limitations, except in such cases where an adult chooses to refuse such services.</p>

Identifying information about individuals who are the subject of a report of suspected adult abuse, neglect, or exploitation shall not be included in the report under this paragraph.

<p class="p10">The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes that some adults of the Commonwealth are unable to manage their own affairs or to protect themselves from abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Often such persons cannot find others able or willing to render assistance. The General Assembly intends, through this chapter, to establish a system of protective services designed to fill this need and to assure their availability to all adults. It is also the intent of the General Assembly to authorize only the least possible restriction on the exercise of personal and civil rights consistent with the person’s needs for services, and to require that due process be followed in imposing such restrictions.</p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and KRS 61.878(1)(j) operate in tandem in authorizing the Department of Social Services to withhold information compiled in the course of an investigation of adult abuse except for release to persons suspected of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. OAG 91-230.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Department for Social Services improperly denied the Kentucky Board of Nursing’s Credentials Consultant’s request for a report prepared by the Department in the course of its investigation into suspected adult abuse pursuant to this section, which is incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of subdivision (1)(k) of KRS 61.878. OAG 93-ORD-131.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cabinet for Health Service properly relied on KRS 61.872(6) and 61.878(1)(a), (k) and (l) and various confidentiality provisions found in both state (KRS 209.140, 210.235, 214.420, 214.625 and 620.050) and federal law, in denying request for inspection of all nursing facility licensure inspection reports for a two year period where the Cabinet sustained the burden of showing that such request was an unreasonable burden on the Cabinet in describing with specificity the actual volumes of records implicated by the request and where the exemptions to disclosure provided by the state and federal law were mandatory and the difficulty of separation of confidential from releasable information constituted an unreasonable burden. 97-ORD-88.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the express terms of KRS 209.140, the Cabinet must withhold all information acquired as a result of an investigation conducted pursuant to that chapter unless the requester can demonstrate that he or she falls within one of the excepted categories codified at KRS 209.140. Neither an executrix or a representative of the alleged abused or neglected or exploited person fall within an excepted category set forth in KRS 209.140. Thus, the Cabinet properly denied the request. OAG 03-ORD-194.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cabinet for Health and Family Services violated the Open Records Act in denying administratrix’s request for a copy of investigative report prepared by the Cabinet following the death of the administratrix’s mother in a nursing home; OAG 03-ORD-194 overruled. OAG 06-ORD-048.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Resolution of this issue turns on the proper interpretation of the phrase “applicable law” appearing in 45 CFR 164.502(g)(4). KRS 209.140 does not vest an executor, administrator, or any other person with authority to act on behalf of a deceased individual or the individual’s estate, but is instead a confidentiality provision the terms of which are engrafted upon the Open Records law by operation of KRS 61.878(1)(l). It is KRS Chapter 395 that grants authority to act on behalf of a deceased individual or of the individual’s estate, and that law, operating in tandem with 45 CFR 164.502(g)(4), requires the Cabinet to accord the requester, as her mother’s personal representative, the same treatment it would have accorded her mother. As the mother would have been entitled to a copy of the report per KRS 209.140(5), so the requester is entitled to a copy. To the extent that OAG 2003-ORD-194 is inconsistent with this view, it is hereby overruled. OAG 2006-ORD-048.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The offense of abuse of an adult by a caretaker does not encompass a situation in which the caretaker permits, rather than instigates, a third person to cause injury.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a person or institution assumes the role of caretaker, the caretaker is prohibited from inflicting physical pain or injury or mental injury or depriving the adult of any services necessary to maintain his or her health and welfare; to describe every possible situation in which the infliction of pain or injury or the deprivation of necessary services could occur would be pointless and would make the statute unwieldy; subsection (2) of this section and KRS 209.020 provide adequate warning to ordinary persons of the prohibited conduct and are sufficient guides to discourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Caretenders, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 821 S.W.2d 83, 1991 Ky. LEXIS 192 (Ky. 1991).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion for a directed verdict on the adult exploitation charge under KRS 209.990 because, despite the undisputed fact that the victim suffered no mental impairment, the evidence was sufficient to show that her physical limitations forced her to seek assistance in managing her affairs. Ample testimony showed that the victim’s limited vision required her to call on others to fill in checks, which she signed herself, and that her awareness of her checking account balance stemmed largely from her son’s or her daughter-in-law’s oral review of the bank statements with her.
