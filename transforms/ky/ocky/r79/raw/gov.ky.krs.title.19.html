Such participation shall be by representation of professional associations relating to infant and preschool care, and by representation from other individuals licensed to provide infant and preschool care, on a committee chaired by the state fire marshal or his or her designate. Such participation shall occur prior to the publication of proposed regulations in the administrative register pursuant to KRS 13A.050 but shall not limit any individual’s right to use those procedures set forth in KRS Chapter 13A concerning comment on or protest of proposed regulations.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since under this section regulations have statutory authority, defendant was required to comply with regulation regarding transfer of gasoline from a barge to a storage tank that required an alarm system to alert personnel to shut down the system or to automatically shut down the system when an overflow occurred or to gauge the tank at frequent intervals and maintain communications so that the flow could promptly be shut down or diverted, and argument that defendant had previously calculated that tank could have easily held the unleaded gasoline the parties had intended to pump into it was without merit.

This term includes, but is not limited to, firecrackers containing more than two (2) grains (130 mg) of explosive composition, aerial shells containing more than forty (40) grams of pyrotechnic composition, and other display pieces which exceed the limits for classification as “consumer fireworks.” Display fireworks are defined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in CPSC, 16 C.F.R. pts. 1500 and 1507, and are classified as Class B explosives by the United States Department of Transportation.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has the statutory authority to license and regulate the operation of pari-mutuel wagering on historic horse racing. Because the regulations for the licensing of historical horse race wagering are consistent with the statutory mandate for “pari-mutuel wagering” on “legitimate horse racing,” the Commission did not exceed the scope of its authority, and the regulations are therefore not invalid.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in overturning penalties the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission imposed upon a trainer and an owner because the 1.0 ng/ml threshold concentration for methocarbamol was not unconstitutional nor arbitrary since limiting the amount of a drug in a horse’s system that was not fully understood was a rational reason for the low threshold; by limiting the amount of medications and drugs given to horses, the Commission was protecting their health and ensuring the integrity of racing.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there is a rational basis for the methocarbamol threshold to be low, and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission is vested with expansive powers, it is axiomatic that this threshold does not exceed the scope of its enabling act; thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the Commission acted outside the scope of its powers.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the racing commission has broad regulatory power over all aspects of the conduct of racing, there is no basis in the statutes for any power in the racing commission to regulate the various activities of a racing association that have nothing to do with the staging of the racing, the quality or integrity of the racing and wagering programs or the improvement of the breed of thoroughbred horses; therefore the commission has no jurisdiction over such things as newspaper and other media advertising, printing of programs, magazine features, food and drink concessions, television, radio or motion picture rights, labor conditions (including hours, wages, pensions, etc.), leases of maintenance vehicles or passenger cars, physical plant improvements, and the like, many of which are under the jurisdiction of other regulatory agencies, such as the department of labor, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, the State Fire Marshal, the planning and zoning commission, etc. OAG 78-731 (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with OAG 86-63).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In over 70 years of regulated racing in Kentucky, it has never been considered that such things as television, radio and/or motion picture rights, labor relations, catering and concessions, or leasing of nonracing facilities are racing activities within the regulatory power of the racing commission; therefore, it must be considered that they are not. OAG 78-731 (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with OAG 86-63).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is highly significant that the stated objects and purposes, and the stated regulatory powers of the commission, are confined to conduct of “racing,” the objects and purposes being to see that “racing” is conducted on a high plane, that “racing” is conducted so as to encourage improvement of the breed, and that persons participating in or attending “racing” be honest and of integrity. OAG 78-731 (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with OAG 86-63).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the state allowed a track to rely on its consistent scheduling of race days for 59 years, and based on the fact that both the track and the state had expended funds in reliance on that consistency, the state cannot without strong justification, deprive the track of its property interest in those dates. Thus, if the commission were to contemplate the issuance of conflicting dates, then such track would be entitled to full procedural due process. OAG 82-436.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before the state can issue conflicting racing dates, affected licensees are entitled to a full due process hearing, and any decision by the commission to grant conflicting dates must be based upon established facts showing that conflicting dates would not violate the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and KRS 230.300(2). Failing such determination, any request for conflicting dates must be denied. OAG 82-436.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instant Racing is not permissible under Kentucky’s current pari-mutuel wagering statutes because it does not constitute pari-mutuel wagering as defined by Kentucky’s Administrative Regulations. OAG 10-001.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has the power to make reasonable warrantless administrative searches and seizures of any property of its licensees on association grounds, with the exception of private dwelling areas, for any items that may be relevant to its investigations.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (KHRA) did not act contrary to statutory law in denying an applicant’s request for a horse racing license as KRS 230.215(1), KRS 230.300(6), and KRS 230.280(2) did not require the KHRA to issue a license to an applicant even though the applicant might have complied with all of the statutory requirements; rather, the statutes merely authorized the KHRA to issue a license. S. Bluegrass Racing,LLC. v. Ky. Horse Racing Auth., 136 S.W.3d 49, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 141 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By giving the commission the power to remedy the disruptions in the regularly scheduled racing the Legislature intended that where extraordinary circumstances intervene, orderly procedure must bow to the overall purpose of fostering and encouraging the legitimate business of thoroughbred racing. OAG 79-572.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The commission may award as many additional racing dates, above and beyond the number of dates cancelled, as are necessary to make recovery of the cancelled dates, and of the loss to the industry and the state which resulted from the cancellations, feasible. OAG 79-572.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement that the commission decide who shall be awarded what dates by March (now November) 1 of each year is designed to promote orderly procedure and certainty, thereby serving the overall policy of this chapter that the business of legitimate thoroughbred racing shall be conducted on the highest possible plane. OAG 79-572.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is clear that the Legislature intended the March (now November) 1 deadline in subsection (2) of this section to be absolute except in certain limited circumstances. OAG 81-366.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is not within the scope of authority of the Kentucky State Racing Commission to award additional racing dates after the March (now November) 1 deadline in the absence of the cancellation of previously scheduled dates due to flood, fire or inclement weather or an extraordinary disruption of the orderly conduct of business amounting to the same crisis level as a natural disaster; a change in stable allocation policy by one race track is not such an unforeseeable, harmful circumstance as to warrant the award of additional racing dates to a second race track after the deadline. OAG 81-366.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The State Racing Commission has the authority, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to grant concurrent racing dates to two or more licensees; the language of subsection (2) of this section does not prohibit the commission from awarding concurrent dates, but merely establishes the effects of concurrent racing as one criteria which the commission must examine when awarding racing dates pursuant to its discretionary power and if the commission finds that awarding concurrent dates to two or more licensees would “serve to nurture, promote, develop, or improve the thoroughbred industry in the Commonwealth” after it considers all the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this section, it may do so. OAG 81-375.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 230.280, 230.361 and this section, the State Racing Commission is only authorized to license meetings and by being so licensed to conduct a meeting the licensee has the resulting power to conduct pari-mutuel wagering if it so desires; of course, such wagering must be conducted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission, but no separate license is statutorily required or authorized. OAG 82-98.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 230.210(7), prior to its 1986 amendment, defined a thoroughbred race meeting in terms which excluded steeplechase events, and since the commission lacks authority to grant a license to conduct a race except at a thoroughbred race meeting, steeplechase events are outside the jurisdiction of the commission; thus, since under the terms of KRS 230.361 no pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted except by persons licensed to conduct thoroughbred race meetings, the commission had no authority to license pari-mutuel wagering at a steeplechase event. OAG 82-98 (Opinions prior to 1986 amendment of KRS 230.210.).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the state allowed a track to rely on its consistent scheduling of race days for 59 years, and based on the fact that both the track and the state had expended funds in reliance on that consistency, the state cannot without strong justification, deprive the track of its property interest in those dates. Thus, if the commission were to contemplate the issuance of conflicting dates, then such track would be entitled to full procedural due process. OAG 82-436.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before the state can issue conflicting racing dates, affected licensees are entitled to a full due process hearing, and any decision by the commission to grant conflicting dates must be based upon established facts showing that conflicting dates would not violate the provisions of KRS 230.215(1) and subsection (2) of this section. Failing such determination, any request for conflicting dates must be denied. OAG 82-436.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since KRS 230.310 specifically provides for the State Racing Commission to license suppliers of food, the licensing of concessionaires would not only seem to be permitted, but a function which the Commission is obligated to perform. OAG 86-63.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in 1992, ch. 109 (HB 749) or in this chapter restricts investments in the entity comprising a licensed track. The only possible restriction comes from subsection (2) of this section, under which the racing commission is authorized to consider the financial stability of an applicant for a license and the “character and reputation for honesty of all persons identified with” the applicant. OAG 92-50.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As long as the simulcast facility is maintained and operated by a licensed track, local interests may invest in the facility through a joint venture with the track or through the purchase of an ownership interest in the track. OAG 92-50.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>With regard to a request for copies of applications for 2000 racing licenses and 2000 racing dates for all Kentucky racetracks, the applications did not qualify for exclusion under KRS 61.878(1)(i), but portions of the applications could be withheld under KRS 61.878(1)(c)2.d. upon a showing that those portions were confidentially disclosed to the Kentucky Racing Commission, were generally recognized as confidential or proprietary, and were compiled and maintained for the grant or review of a license to do business.

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> Every person not required to be licensed under KRS 230.300 who desires to participate in horse racing in the Commonwealth as a horse owner, trainer, jockey, apprentice jockey, agent, stable employee, racing official, association employee, or employee of a person or concern contracting with the association to provide a service or commodity and which requires their presence on association grounds during a race meeting, or veterinarian, farrier, horse dentist, or supplier of food, tack, medication, or horse feed, or in any other capacity as the racing commission shall from time to time establish by administrative regulation, shall first apply to the racing commission for a license to participate in the activity on association grounds during a race meeting. No person required to be licensed by this section may participate in any activity required to be licensed on association grounds during a race meeting without a valid license therefor. An applicant for a license shall submit to the racing commission fingerprints as may be required and other information necessary and reasonable for processing a license application. The racing commission is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with the Department of Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to conduct a criminal history background check of an applicant. The racing commission may issue a license if it finds that the financial responsibility, age, experience, reputation, competence, and general fitness of the applicant to perform the activity permitted by a license are consistent with the best interest of racing and the maintenance of the honesty, integrity, and high quality thereof.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> A license may be issued for the calendar year for which an applicant applies or, if authorized by administrative regulation, a license may be issued that expires on the last day of the birth month of the licensee. A license may be renewed by the racing commission. The license shall be valid at all horse race meetings in the Commonwealth during the period for which it is issued unless suspended or revoked under the administrative regulations promulgated by the racing commission under this chapter. With respect to horse owners and trainers, the racing commission may promulgate administrative regulations to facilitate and promote uniform, reciprocal licensing with other states.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (KHRA) disqualifed a harness horse as the winner of two (2) races due to the presence of flunixin in its urine. The Circuit Court properly affirmed this decision because (1) the KHRA’s finding was not arbitrary and capricious, as it was supported by substantial evidence; (2) it was unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody and the evidence showed there was no tampering with the urine samples; (3) the “trainer responsibility rule” (811 KAR 1:090) was constitutional; (4) there was no double jeopardy violation, since the action was civil in nature; and (5) 811 KAR 1:090, § 4(1), which outlawed flunixin for harness horses but not thoroughbreds, did not violate equal protection principles.

<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> In circumstances where a transaction described in subsection (2) of this section is accomplished through a public auction the bill of sale requirement described in subsection (2) of this section may be satisfied by the issuance of an auction receipt, generated by the auction house, and signed by the purchaser or the purchaser’s duly authorized agent. An agent who signs an auction receipt on behalf of his or her principal shall do so only if authorized in writing. When presented with such authorization, all other parties to the transaction may presume that an agent signing on behalf of his or her principal is duly authorized to act for the principal.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> It shall be unlawful for any person to act as an agent for both the purchaser and the seller, which is hereby defined as a dual agent, in a transaction involving the sale, purchase, or transfer of an interest in an equine without:</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> Notwithstanding any provision of the Kentucky Revised Statutes to the contrary, for transactions contemplated by this section that are accomplished through a public auction, this section shall not require disclosure of the reserves, the identity of the principals, or the auctioneer’s commissions. Auction companies shall not be deemed to be dual agents for all purposes under this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(10)</b> The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale, purchase, or transfer of an equine used for showing if the sale, purchase, or transfer does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under a regulation promulgated by the racing commission pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted only by a licensed racing association holding a race, and only on that association’s “licensed premises” or “within the enclosure” where the race is being held; accordingly, a “teletrack” system, which consists of opening licensed racetracks for the purpose of wagering on televised races being conducted at another track, is prohibited, since no association may conduct wagering on any race held by another association. OAG 82-4.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 230.210(7) defines a thoroughbred race meeting in terms which exclude steeplechase events, and since the commission lacks authority to grant a license to conduct a race except at a thoroughbred race meeting, KRS 230.300(1), steeplechase events are outside the jurisdiction of the commission; thus, since under the terms of this section no pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted except by persons licensed to conduct thoroughbred race meetings, the commission has no authority to license pari-mutuel wagering at a steeplechase event. OAG 82-98.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under KRS 230.280, 230.300 and this section, the State Racing Commission is only authorized to license meetings and by being so licensed to conduct a meeting the licensee has the resulting power to conduct pari-mutuel wagering if it so desires; of course, such wagering must be conducted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission, but no separate license is statutorily required or authorized. OAG 82-98.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although games of chance using videotapes of past horse races or straight wagering on these videotaped races at a “casino night” would not be “live,” they would still violate the raffle requirements of KRS 238.505(8) and 238.545(3), and also violate the parimutuel wagering statutes, which provide that parimutuel wagering shall be conducted only by a person authorized under KRS Chapter 230 to conduct a race meeting and only upon a licensed premises.

Pursuant to the laws of his party state, each official shall have the assistance of his state’s racing commission or the equivalent thereof in considering issues related to licensing of participants in live racing and in fulfilling his responsibilities as the representative from his state to the compact committee. If an official is unable to perform any duty in connection with the powers and duties of the compact committee, the racing commission or equivalent thereof from his state shall designate another of its members as an alternate who shall serve in his place and represent the party state as its official on the compact committee until that racing commission or equivalent thereof determines that the original representative official is able once again to perform his duties as that party state’s representative official on the compact committee. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the affected state’s racing commission or equivalent thereof to the compact committee as the committee’s bylaws may provide.</p>

Provided, however, that with regard to requests for criminal history record information on each applicant for a license, and with regard to the effect of a criminal record on the issuance or renewal of a license, the compact committee shall determine for each category of participants in live racing which licensure requirements for that category are, in its judgment, the most restrictive licensure requirements of any party state for that category and shall adopt licensure requirements for that category that are, in its judgment, comparable to those most restrictive requirements.</p>

Only officials on, and employees of, the compact committee may receive and review such criminal history record information, and those officials and employees may use that information only for the purposes of this compact. No such official or employee may disclose or disseminate such information to any person or entity other than another official on or employee of the compact committee. The fingerprints of each applicant for a license from the compact committee shall be taken by the compact committee, its employees, or its designee and, pursuant to Public Law 92-544 or Public Law 100-413, shall be forwarded to a state identification bureau, or to an association of state officials regulating pari-mutuel wagering designated by the Attorney General of the United States, for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a criminal history record check.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> As used in this section, “interstate common wagering pool” means a pari-mutuel pool established in one (1) horse racing jurisdiction that is combined with comparable pari-mutuel pools from at least one (1) horse racing jurisdiction for the purpose of establishing payoff prices in the various jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Interstate wagers at a receiving track may form an interstate common wagering pool with wagers at a track in another jurisdiction, and the receiving track may adopt the commission and breakage rates of the track at which the race is being run. The racing commission may also approve types of wagering, distribution of winnings, and rules of racing for interstate common wagering pools that are different from those that normally apply in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> Wagers placed on any races run at track in Kentucky may be combined with wagers placed at tracks in other jurisdictions to form an interstate common wagering pool located either within or outside Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> A track’s participation in an interstate common wagering pool does not cause that track to be considered to be doing business in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction where the track is physically located. Excise taxes and commission rates may not be imposed on any interstate common wagering pool other than on amounts actually wagered in Kentucky. The combination of pari-mutuel pools as provided in this section constitutes the communication of wagering information for purposes of calculating odds and payoffs only and does not constitute the transfer of wagers in interstate commerce.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The question of whether or not a go-cart business would require a permit rests within the sound discretion of the county judge, and he may or may not require a permit to operate such a business. OAG 60-908.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An establishment which sells alcoholic beverages in the county outside an incorporated area can be required to have both a permit for a place of entertainment under KRS chapter 231 and an alcoholic beverage license under KRS 243.060. OAG 67-46.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There must be only one place of entertainment license for each place of entertainment regardless of whether the activities permitted there satisfy only one definition of a place of entertainment or several. OAG 67-46.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A grocery store which sells malt beverages by the package is not a “place of entertainment” within the meaning of this section. OAG 69-343.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motor vehicle race track comes within the provisions of this section and KRS 231.020. OAG 71-539.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>National guard members who merely leased an armory to another party for a teenage dance would not be subject to prosecution for violation of this section and KRS 231.020. OAG 72-355.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is some doubt that this section applies to the spasmodic and occasional leasing of premises to different lessees. OAG 72-355.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An ordinance by a fiscal court imposing a license tax on operators of places of entertainment falling under the provisions of this section would be a valid revenue measure. OAG 72-821.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an ordinance providing a license for operators of places of entertainment does not attempt to change the basic procedure and substantive provisions in the issuance of such permits or licenses by the county court as outlined in KRS 231.010 to 231.130, the ordinance would be a valid exercise of the county’s police power. OAG 72-821.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the police powers granted in KRS 67.083, it would appear that a fiscal court could enact an ordinance providing a license fee for those places of entertainment covered in this section, subject to the rule that the revenues cannot exceed the reasonable policing cost. OAG 72-821.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no general exception from the requirement of licensing for charitable organizations operating places of entertainment. OAG 75-99.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An American Legion post that occasionally sponsors and occasionally leases its hall for dances and shows for high school students and adults would not be required to secure a permit from the county court as a place of entertainment. OAG 75-99.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An outdoor rock and roll music festival to be held on a county farm for two days would be temporary entertainment and thus the affair would not constitute a “place of entertainment.” OAG 77-568.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By enacting former KRS 237.110(8) (now see (10)), the General Assembly expressly restricted disclosure of the public records requested to “hard copy form only.” Since KRS 61.878(1)(l) exempts from disclosure public records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential by enactment of the General Assembly, the Kentucky State Police properly denied the request to produce the requested list of names of concealed permit holders in electronic format. OAG 03-ORD-222.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because any identifying information relating to concealed deadly weapon license holders other than a list naming all CCDW license holders (in hard copy format only) is exempt from disclosure pursuant to KRS 237.110(8) (see now (10)), incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS 61.878(1)(l), the State Police properly relied upon KRS 237.110(8) (see now (10)) in denying the request.

<p class="p6">The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky hereby declares that charitable gaming conducted by charitable organizations is an important method of raising funds for legitimate charitable purposes and is in the public interest. The purpose of this chapter is to comply with constitutional requirements by establishing an effective and efficient mechanism for regulating charitable gaming which includes defining the scope of charitable gaming activities, setting standards for the conduct of charitable gaming which insure honesty and integrity, providing for means of accounting for all moneys generated through the conduct of charitable gaming, and providing for suitable penalties for violations of laws and administrative regulations. The intent of this chapter is to prevent the commercialization of charitable gaming, to prevent participation in charitable gaming by criminal and other undesirable elements, and to prevent the diversion of funds from legitimate charitable purposes. In order to carry out the purpose and intent, the provisions of this chapter, and any administrative regulations promulgated in accordance with this chapter, shall be construed in the public interest and strictly enforced.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> A license holder may appeal any administrative action taken under KRS 238.560. A license holder shall be notified in writing of any action to be taken against him. The notification may be delivered in person or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the license holder. Service of notification of administrative action, whether by hand delivery or by certified mail, shall be deemed complete if the license holder fails or refuses to accept delivery. For service by hand delivery, notification shall be deemed received upon acceptance of delivery or upon failure or refusal to accept delivery, and the person affecting service on behalf of the department shall record the fact of the failure or refusal. For service by certified mail, the notification of administrative action shall be deemed received when the license holder accepts delivery or fails or refuses to accept delivery at the last known address. The notification shall specify the charges against the license holder, specify the proposed administrative sanction, and advise him of his right to appeal the decision within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the notification.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Upon receipt of an appeal, the department shall schedule the matter for an administrative hearing that shall be conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> Any provisions of KRS Chapter 13B notwithstanding, within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of a hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare and present to the commissioner a recommended order based on findings of fact and conclusions of law. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the recommended order, the commissioner shall affirm, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the recommended order and shall issue a final order. The final order shall be the final administrative action on the matter and a copy of the final order shall be mailed to the license holder, by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> Any administrative action taken under this section shall, upon appeal, be stayed until a final order is issued, with the exception of a summary suspension. The department may issue an emergency order pursuant to KRS 13B.125 to summarily suspend a license upon finding that continued operation of the license holder pending a hearing would constitute a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> A final order of the commissioner may be appealed to Franklin Circuit Court in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B. If the license holder against whom administrative action is proposed does not request an appeal of the action, the department shall enter a final order imposing the proposed administrative action.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> A fee is imposed on charitable gaming in the amount of fifty-three hundredths of one percent (0.53%) of gross receipts derived from all charitable gaming conducted by charitable organizations required to be licensed in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The amount of the fee shall be adjusted by October 1 of each odd-numbered year in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Each licensed charitable organization shall remit to the department all moneys due as set forth in administrative regulations promulgated by the department. Failure by a licensed charitable organization to timely remit the fee required under this subsection upon notice of delinquency shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action in accordance with KRS 238.560.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> The charitable gaming regulatory account is hereby created as a revolving account within the agency revenue fund and under the control of the Public Protection Cabinet. All revenues generated from the fee levied in subsection (1) of this section from license fees and from administrative fines imposed by the department shall be deposited in this account. Fund amounts attributable to the fee levied in subsection (1) of this section that are not expended at the close of a fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year.</p>
