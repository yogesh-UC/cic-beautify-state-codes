<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where House Bill 286 (Ky. Acts 1986, ch. 485) introducing the enactment of this section was titled “AN ACT relating to commercial paper,” the legislature did not intend to render it unconstitutional under Ky. Const., § 51 by placing it in the KRS contract law chapter, KRS Chapter 371. The statute retained its exclusive applicability to guaranties of commercial paper irrespective of its particular situs in Kentucky’s Revised Statutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>APL, Inc. v. Ohio Valley Aluminum, Inc., 839 S.W.2d 571, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 212 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992) (decided prior to the 1990 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where this section was amended in 1990, the title of the act was changed from “AN ACT relating to commercial paper” to “AN ACT relating to guaranties.” Plaintiff corporation contended that the legislature thus explicitly revealed in 1990 that it had intended all along for the statute to apply to all guaranties. Plaintiff’s guaranty to defendant was signed in 1989. In 1989 this section had applicability solely to guaranties relating to commercial paper, pursuant to the statute’s 1986 enactment. Plaintiff’s guaranty to defendant did not guaranty a transaction involving commercial paper. The fact that this section was amended in 1990 to be given broader applicability was irrelevant for purposes of the appeal. APL, Inc. v. Ohio Valley Aluminum, Inc., 839 S.W.2d 571, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 212 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>accordance with the plain meaning of the statute, where a credit application<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>included a guaranty agreement on the application in two (2) places, the agreements<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>were not required to state either the debtor’s maximum liability or a termination<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>date and the agreements were therefore valid and enforceable against the debtor.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A purported guaranty allegedly given by a Chapter 7 debtor to a lender did not meet the requirements of KRS 371.065 because the only reference to a guaranty was one line on a promissory note that stated “with personal guaranty” of the debtors.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Guaranty agreement related to a promissory note was enforceable against the guarantor because the agreement effectively referenced the instrument it guaranteed within the meaning of KRS 371.065 as the Schedule 1 document, attached to and referenced by the agreement, explicitly referred to the promissory note.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a contract case, there was no error in a default judgment that limited post-judgment interest on a retail installment contract to 12 percent per annum because a purchaser did not agree to the accrual of interest at any rate, much less at a rate in excess of the statutory rate; the purchaser agreed only to buy a vehicle at a price determined by adding the cost of the vehicle if she had paid cash and the time price differential. Moreover, the court could not deviate from the 12 percent rate because the claim here was for liquidated damages. Serv. Fin. Co. v. Ware, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 47 (Ky. Ct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Retail installment sales of mobile homes would not fall within the ambit of KRS Chapter 190 which sets out the provisions for installment contract sales for motor vehicles whose cash sale price is $5,000 or less, because mobile homes do not fall within the category of motor vehicles as defined in KRS 190.090(4), and are therefore covered by the provisions of KRS 371.210 et seq.
