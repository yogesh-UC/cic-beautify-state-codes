<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The General Assembly hereby declares:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The venting of coalbed methane and degasification of coal seams is approved by the Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring the safe recovery of coal;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The positive economic impact of coal mining to the Commonwealth is currently greater than that of coalbed methane production;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Coalbed methane is not found in conventional gas reservoirs;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Any development of coalbed methane should be undertaken in a way to protect and preserve the environment and protect and preserve the coal for future safe mining and the maximum recovery of coal;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Commercial recovery and marketing of coalbed methane should be facilitated whenever appropriate to meet the energy needs of both the Commonwealth and the United States;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> The extraction of methane from mineable coal enhances mine safety, promotes environmental goals and objectives, and conserves an important energy resource; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(g)</b> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was enacted, in part, to encourage coalbed methane development and the Commonwealth should enact legislation to carry out the purpose of that act.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Therefore, in order to encourage and ensure the fullest practical safe recovery of both coal and coalbed methane, consistent with the above declarations and findings, this chapter is established to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Authorize coalbed methane well permits;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Regulate the design of coalbed methane wells and recovery techniques;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Provide a process to enable coalbed methane well operators and coalbed methane owners to proceed with the orderly development and production of coalbed methane pending the judicial resolution of issues relating to coalbed methane ownership.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the General Assembly expressly finds that establishing an orderly process to permit and produce coalbed methane shall in no way be construed to create an inference or presumption as to the ownership of coalbed methane in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or be construed to or be used or interpreted to apply to any well otherwise permitted, approved, or regulated under KRS Chapter 353, except for any wells that are to be permitted, converted to, or operated as coalbed methane wells.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth and in the public interest to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Safeguard, preserve, and protect coal seams for safe mining; facilitate the expeditious, safe evacuation of coalbed methane from the coalbeds of this state; and maintain the ability and right of coal operators at all times to vent coalbed methane from mine areas for the safe recovery of coal;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Foster, encourage, and promote the commercial development of the Commonwealth’s coalbed methane by establishing procedures for issuing permits and forming drilling units for coalbed methane wells without adversely affecting the safety of mining or the mineability of coal seams;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Safeguard, protect, and enforce the correlative rights of coalbed methane operators and coalbed methane owners in a pool of coalbed methane so that each operator and owner may obtain his or her just and equitable share of production from coalbed methane;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Create a state permitting procedure and authority to provide for and facilitate coalbed methane development as encouraged by the Energy Policy Act of 1992; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Seek the deletion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from the list of affected states by the Secretary of the United States Department of Interior as provided for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.</p>

The notice shall give the number of the well and its location, and fix the time at which the work of plugging and filling will be commenced. The time shall not be less than fifteen (15) days after the day on which the notice was received, or in due course should be received, by the department. The department shall prescribe the form of notice to be used. A representative of any coal interest holder, at his or her own expense and liability, and of the department may be present at the plugging and filling of the well. Regardless of whether representatives appear, the well operator may proceed, at the time fixed, to plug and fill the well. When the well is plugged and filled, an affidavit setting forth the time and manner in which the well was plugged shall be made in triplicate by two (2) persons experienced in plugging and filling wells who participated in the work. The affidavit shall be made on forms furnished by the department. One (1) copy of the affidavit shall be retained by the well operator, one (1) provided to each coal interest holder, and one (1) provided to the department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> In addition to the notification required under subsection (1) of this section, prior to the abandonment of a coalbed methane well the operator shall submit a plugging plan which is subject to approval by the department.

Each string of casing that is run through a workable coalbed shall be seated at least thirty (30) feet below the workable coalbed in twenty (20) feet of cement, mud, clay, or other nonporous material that will make an effective seal. If a second workable coalbed is found less than thirty (30) feet below the first workable coalbed, the casing shall be seated and mudded off as above provided at least thirty (30) feet below the second workable coalbed. If gas is found between the two (2) workable coalbeds, it shall be treated as prescribed by this chapter. After any such string of casing has been properly seated, drilling may proceed immediately.</p>

The largest sized casing to be used in the well shall be centrally placed within this liner. The liner may be welded to the casing to be used, and the space between the liner and the casing shall be filled with cement as the liner and casing are lowered into the hole. Cement shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to a depth of twenty (20) feet to form a sealed seat for both liner and casing. Following the setting of the liner, drilling may proceed. If it is necessary to drill through the horizon of two (2) or more workable coalbeds where the coal has been removed, the liner shall be started not less than twenty (20) feet below the lowest horizon penetrated and shall extend to a point not less than twenty (20) feet above the highest horizon penetrated.</p>

Upon the department’s plugging of an abandoned coalbed methane well in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, the department may sell all equipment removed from that well by sealed bid, or may include the equipment as part of compensation in the contract for the plugging of the well. Proceeds from the sale shall be deposited into the coalbed methane well plugging fund, established in KRS 349.120(3).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Not less than thirty (30) days before advertising for bids for the plugging of coalbed methane wells, the department shall publish, in a newspaper of general circulation, and in locally published newspapers serving the areas in which the wells proposed for plugging are located, notices of all wells on which there is salvageable equipment, described as to farm name, Carter Coordinate, and state plane coordinate location, for which the department intends to seek bids for plugging. If a person other than the operator claims an interest in the equipment of a well proposed for plugging, the person shall provide documentation of that interest to the department within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of the notice of the department’s intent to plug a well. Prior to the department’s advertising of bids for the plugging of a well, the department shall release the well’s equipment to the person deemed to have an interest in that equipment. It shall be the duty of the interest holder to remove the equipment before the well is plugged. If documentation as to an asserted interest is not provided to the department in the manner described in this subsection or if a person deemed to be an interest holder fails to remove the equipment before a well is plugged, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of the equipment in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If a person fails to comply with subsection (1) of this section, any person lawfully in possession of land adjacent to the coalbed methane well or the department may enter on the land upon which the well is located and plug the well in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, and may maintain a civil action against the owner or person abandoning the well, jointly or severally, to recover the cost of plugging the well. This subsection shall not apply to persons owning the land on which the well is situated, and drilled by other persons.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> In conjunction with the plugging and abandonment of any coalbed methane well or the reworking of any coalbed methane well, the operator shall restore the surface and any improvements thereon to a condition as near as practicable to their condition prior to commencement of work. The surface owner and operator may waive this requirement in writing, subject to the approval of the department that the waiver is in accordance with its administrative regulations.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When any person submits to the department an application for a permit to drill a coalbed methane well, or to reopen, deepen, or temporarily abandon any coalbed methane well which is not covered by a surety bond, the department shall, except as provided in this section, require from the well operator a bond in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bonds shall be made in favor of the Department for Natural Resources, conditioned that the wells upon abandonment shall be plugged in accordance with the administrative regulations and that all records required by the department be filed as specified. All bonds shall remain in effect until the plugging of the well is approved by the department, or the bond is released by the department. Any well operator in lieu of the bond may file with the department a blanket bond in a sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), covering all coalbed methane wells drilled or to be drilled in the Commonwealth by the principal in the bond, and the acceptance and approval by the department of the blanket bond shall be in full compliance with the above provision requiring an individual well bond. The department may establish a bond in a sum greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for an individual well or blanket bond in sum greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) if the department determines that the particular circumstances of the drilling of the well or wells warrant an increase in the bond amount. A deposit in cash or a bank-issued irrevocable letter of credit may serve in lieu of either of the individual well or blanket bonds. A certificate of deposit, the principal of which is pledged in lieu of a bond and whose interest is payable to the party making the pledge, may also be accepted by the department. If an operator is required to post individual well bonds exceeding a total of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or elects to post a blanket bond, the certificate of deposit shall be accepted by the department in lieu of that portion of the amount of the bonds exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bond or bonds referred to in this section shall be executed by the well operator as principal and, if a surety bond, by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. A deposit in cash shall serve in lieu of either of the above bonds; all cash bonds accepted by the department shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account, with the interest thereon payable to the special agency account known as the coalbed methane well plugging fund, created in subsection (3) of this section, to be used in accordance with the purposes described therein.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> A successor to the well operator shall post bond, pay a twenty-five dollar ($25) fee per well to the department, and notify the department in writing in advance of commencing use or operations of a well or wells. The successor shall assume the obligations of this chapter as to a particular well or wells and relieve the original permittee of responsibility under this chapter with respect to the well or wells. It shall be the responsibility of the selling operator to require the successor operator to post bond before use or operation is commenced by the successor and relief of responsibility under this chapter is granted to the original permittee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> All sums received through the forfeiture of bonds shall be placed in the State Treasury and credited to a special agency account to be designated as the coalbed methane well plugging fund, which shall be in an interest-bearing account with the interest thereon payable to the fund. This fund shall be available to the department and shall be expended for the plugging of any abandoned coalbed methane wells coming within the authority of the department pursuant to this chapter. The plugging of any coalbed methane wells pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed to relieve the operator or any other person from civil or criminal liability which would exist except for the plugging. Any unencumbered and any unexpended balance of this fund remaining at the end of any fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward for the purpose of the fund until expended or until appropriated by subsequent legislative action.</p>

<p class="p7">The General Assembly finds that the Commonwealth is the leading producer of coal and that the production of coal in Kentucky contributes significantly to the nation’s energy needs. The General Assembly further finds that unregulated surface coal mining operations cause soil erosion, damage from rolling stones and overburden, landslides, stream pollution, the accumulation of stagnant water and the seepage of contaminated water, increase the likelihood of floods, destroy the value of land for agricultural purposes, destroy aesthetic values, counteract efforts for the conservation of soil, water and other natural resources, destroy or impair the property rights of citizens, create fire hazards, and in general create hazards dangerous to life and property, so as to constitute an imminent and inordinate peril to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that lands that have been subjected to surface coal mining operations and have not been reclaimed and rehabilitated in accordance with modern standards constitute the aforementioned perils to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that there are wide variations in the circumstances and conditions surrounding and arising out of surface coal mining operations due primarily to difference in topographical and geological conditions, and by reason thereof it is necessary, in order to provide the most effective, beneficial and equitable solution to the problem, that a broad discretion be vested in the authority designated to administer and enforce the regulatory provisions enacted by the General Assembly. The General Assembly further finds that governmental responsibility for regulating surface coal mining operations rests with state government and hereby directs the Energy and Environment Cabinet to take all actions necessary to preserve and exercise the Commonwealth’s authority, to the exclusion of all other governmental entities except the Commonwealth and agencies thereof and except as provided in KRS Chapter 100. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to provide such regulation and control of surface coal mining operations as to minimize or prevent injurious effects on the people and resources of the Commonwealth. To that end, the cabinet is directed to rigidly enforce this chapter and to adopt whatever administrative regulations are found necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.</p>

Therefore, this legislation shall become a validly enacted law when signed by the governor [April 3, 1980], but the provisions of this Act shall not become effective until approval of the state program by the United States Secretary of Interior pursuant to Public Law 95-87, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.”</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> In case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, any Circuit Court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by any party, may issue to that person an order requiring him to appear before the cabinet, there to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Any person aggrieved by a final order of the cabinet resulting from a hearing on the issuance of a notice of noncompliance, the issuance of an order for cessation and immediate compliance, the assessment of civil penalties, or a bond forfeiture may obtain a review of the order by filing in the Franklin Circuit Court or the Circuit Court of the county within which the mine is located, within thirty (30) days after the entry of the order, a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part, provided that a surety on a performance bond shall not file such petition until it has complied with subsection (3) of this section. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith served upon the cabinet, and thereupon the cabinet shall certify and file in court a copy of the record before the cabinet, including therein all pleadings, orders, documentary exhibits and the stenographic transcript of the testimony taken before the cabinet. When these have been filed, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, enforce or set aside the order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the cabinet or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The findings of the cabinet as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearings before the cabinet, the court may order that additional evidence be taken before the cabinet in such manner and upon such condition as the court may consider proper. The cabinet may modify its findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so taken; and it shall file any modified or new findings with the court, which if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive, and any recommendation for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The commencement of the proceedings under this section does not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the cabinet’s order. An appeal may be taken from the judgment of the Circuit Court to the Court of Appeals on the same terms and conditions as an appeal is taken in any civil action.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Where the cabinet has ordered forfeiture of a performance bond, the surety shall forward to the cabinet by certified mail a cashier’s check for the required amount within seven (7) business days from the effective date of the order. The cabinet shall establish an interest-bearing escrow account and shall deposit therein the full amount of the forfeiture rendered by the surety. The amount shall continue to be held by the cabinet until completion of judicial review as authorized in subsection (2) of this section. If the final decision following the review reverses the order of the secretary of the cabinet, the cabinet shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of such order, refund to the surety the appropriate amount plus all interest accrued from the date of deposit to the date of the final order.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> In the case of a proceeding to review any order or decision issued by the secretary under this chapter pertaining to surface coal mining operations, the court may, under such conditions as it may prescribe, grant such temporary relief as it deems appropriate pending final determination of the proceedings if:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> All parties to the proceedings have been notified and given an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief;</p>

The applicant shall file with the cabinet a bond payable to the Commonwealth of Kentucky with surety satisfactory to the cabinet in the sum to be determined by the cabinet for each acre or fraction thereof of the area of land affected, with a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this chapter and of the administrative regulations of the cabinet. The cabinet shall forfeit the entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment in the event of forfeiture. In determining the amount of the bond, the cabinet shall take into consideration the character and nature of the overburden; the future suitable use of the land involved; the cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential. The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in the event of forfeiture. Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond protocol currently in use, the cabinet shall immediately promulgate administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements, including but not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of bonds. Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be established by promulgating administrative regulations under KRS Chapter 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the amount of the bond in any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a failure to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative regulation shall automatically be declared deficient in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(12)</b> The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of operations with surface effects of underground mining and other surface coal mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section.

<p class="p6"><b>(13)</b> Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of successive renewal upon expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a permit shall pay a basic fee set by regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of the permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on application for renewal the burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of this chapter, unless it is established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(15)</b> Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original permit. Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(16)</b> Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the permittee has not commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the permit within three (3) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the cabinet may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions are necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or threatening substantial economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced surface mining operations at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is initiated.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(17)</b> Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined area shall contain information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the proposed method of operation will result in stable post-mining conditions, and reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous mining activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and reclaimed subsequent to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or revision shall not be issued. The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue a permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining operations will provide for reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past mining activities, or stabilization or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the extent practical and feasible; provided, however, that in all cases the holes be properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet above the coal seam being mined.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(18)</b> All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its impurities, and which are not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> If the cabinet finds that the overburden on any part of the area of land described in the application for a permit is such that experience in the Commonwealth with a similar type of operation upon land with similar overburden shows that substantial deposition of sediment in stream beds, landslides, or acid water pollution cannot feasibly be prevented, the cabinet may delete the part of the land described in the application upon which that overburden exists.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Subject to valid existing rights, no surface coal mining operations except those which existed on or before August 4, 1977, shall be permitted within three hundred (300) feet from any occupied dwelling unless waived by the owner, nor within three hundred (300) feet of any public building, school, church, community, or institutional building, public park, or within one hundred (100) feet of a cemetery. The cabinet shall not issue a permit if it finds that the operation will constitute a hazard to or do physical damage to a dwelling house, public building, school, church, cemetery, commercial or institutional building, public road, stream, lake, or other public property. The cabinet shall delete the areas from the permit application or operation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Subject to valid existing rights, no surface coal mining operations except those which existed on or before August 4, 1977, shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of the outside right-of-way line of any public road, except where mine access roads or haulage roads join the right-of-way line. The cabinet shall permit the roads to be relocated or the area affected to lie within one hundred (100) feet of the road if, after public notice and opportunity for public hearing in the locality, a written finding is made that the interest of the public and the affected land owner will be protected, and shall not approve the application for a permit where the surface coal mining operation will adversely affect a wild river established pursuant to KRS Chapter 146, a state park or place listed on the National Register of Historic Places unless adequate screening and other measures as approved by the cabinet are incorporated into the permit application.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Subject to valid existing rights, no surface coal mining operations except those which existed on August 4, 1977, shall be permitted on any privately owned lands within the boundaries of units of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge Systems, the National System of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers designated under Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and national recreation areas designated by Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> If based on the information provided pursuant to KRS 350.060(3)(h) and other relevant information, the cabinet finds that any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently in violation of this chapter or other requirements listed pursuant to KRS 350.060(3)(h), the cabinet shall not issue the permit or permit renewal until the applicant submits proof satisfactory to the cabinet that the violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected. It shall be grounds to deny a permit or permit renewal if the cabinet, based on any information available to it and after a hearing, makes a finding that the applicant, or the operator specified in the application has demonstrated a pattern of willful violations pursuant to KRS 350.130(3).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> The prohibition of subsection (6) of this section shall not apply to a permit applicant with a violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for and under a permit for remining held by the applicant.

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> As determined by administrative regulations of the cabinet, time and distance limits shall be established requiring backfilling, grading, and planting to be kept current, so that all reclamation efforts proceed in an environmentally sound manner and as contemporaneously as practicable under regulations promulgated by the cabinet.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Application for a deferment pursuant to this section shall be in the form prescribed by the cabinet. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing the need for the deferment. The applicant for the deferment shall demonstrate that reclamation on the site is contemporaneous as of the date of the request for deferment and that distance requirements for contemporaneous reclamation will be met during the period of the deferment. Approval of the deferment request shall be made in writing. The approval shall state that the deferment is justified and that no environmental damage will occur during the period of deferment. Reclamation deferments may be approved for a period reasonably related to the specified conditions justifying the deferment, but the aggregate deferral period shall not exceed thirty (30) months. The deferral shall not extend beyond the expiration date of the permit. The cabinet shall periodically reexamine and update the amount of the bond on the permit area so that the amount of the bond is sufficient to assure completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in the event of forfeiture.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If the permittee or operator desires to conduct drift mining or other underground mining upon the premises or use the openings for haulageways or other lawful purposes, the permittee or operator may designate locations to be used for purposes at which places it will not be necessary to backfill until the drift or other underground mining or other use is completed, during which time the bond on file for that portion of the operation shall not be released. That portion of the locations shall be described and designated on the map attached thereto. If the permittee or operator wishes to combine surface operations with underground mining operations to assure maximum practical recovery of coal resources, the cabinet may grant a variance, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the cabinet, for specific areas within the reclamation plan from the requirement that reclamation efforts proceed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section so as to permit underground mining operations prior to reclamation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The cabinet may release in whole or in part the reclamation bond or deposit for a particular operation if the cabinet is satisfied that the reclamation covered by the bond or deposit or portion thereof has been accomplished as required by this chapter.

When determining the amount of bond to be released after successful revegetation has been established, the cabinet shall retain that amount of the bond for the revegetated area which would be sufficient for a third party to cover the cost of reestablishing revegetation; this amount shall be retained for the period specified for permittee responsibility for reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall be released under this subsection as long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of requirements set by this chapter or until soil productivity for prime farm lands has returned to levels of yield equivalent to those of unmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from soil surveys that may be required to be included in the permit application. If a sedimentation pond is to be retained as a permanent impoundment, the portion of bond may be released under this subsection so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the permittee or the landowner have been made with the cabinet.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Upon the filing of an application for bond release by a permittee, or the initiation of the release by the cabinet, the cabinet shall notify, within thirty (30) days of the filing or initiation, the municipality where the surface coal mining operation is located, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Upon the filing of any partial or total bond release request by a permittee, the cabinet shall within thirty (30) days conduct an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work involved. The evaluation shall consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty to complete any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface or subsurface water is occurring, the probability of continuance of future occurrence of the pollution, and the estimated cost of abating the pollution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> The cabinet shall notify the permittee in writing of its decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond or deposit within five (5) days following receipt of proof of public advertisement as required in subsection (5)(b), or the end of the thirty (30) day public comment period, whichever is later, if no public hearing is held pursuant to subsection (10) of this section; and if there has been a public hearing held pursuant to subsection (10) of this section, within thirty (30) days thereafter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> If the cabinet disapproves the application for release of the bond or portion thereof, the cabinet shall notify the permittee, in writing, stating the reasons for disapproval and recommending corrective actions necessary to serve the release and allowing opportunity for a public hearing. The cabinet shall not disapprove an application for release of a surety bond or a bond secured by a letter of credit as provided for under subsection (4)(a) or (b) of this section or under the partial release provisions applicable to an interim permit, or take any action to forfeit the surety bond, or bond secured by letter of credit, solely upon the permittee’s failure to pay penalties or fines, if applicable reclamation requirements for the requested release have been fully met. The cabinet shall not continue to hold under the interim or permanent program remaining surety bond proceeds or the remaining bond secured by a letter of credit where a forfeiture has occurred solely as a result of a failure to pay penalties or fines, if the reclamation requirements of this chapter have been fully met.</p>

<p class="p7">The General Assembly finds that the reclamation of coal mine sites can benefit from pollinator habitat sites. These sites are an important conservation resource which will encourage and protect the habitat for pollinators like honeybees, bumble bees, and other bee species. The protection and location of pollinator sites situated on mine sites can increase the revegetation rates during the reclamation period which supports soil and hydrologic stability. Therefore, the General Assembly hereby directs the cabinet to develop a plan in conjunction with the Division of Conservation to encourage coal licensees to locate and protect pollinator sites on reclamation sites and to use high-value trees and shrubs to aid in pollen transfer.</p>

The cabinet shall set forth in its notice a reasonable time period but not more than ninety (90) days for the abatement of the violation. If any permittee, person, or operator has not abated the violation within the time prescribed in the notice of noncompliance, the secretary or other authorized personnel of the cabinet shall issue to the permittee, operator, or person an order for immediate compliance and cessation of any mining activities or operations which are contributing to the violation. The order shall require the permittee, person, or operator to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible. The secretary is authorized to promulgate reasonable administrative regulations for the implementation of this section. The notice or order shall be handed to the person in charge of the operation and the operator or person engaged in coal exploration operations or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the permanent address shown on the application for a permit; or by electronic mail to the address shown on the permit application or otherwise voluntarily provided to the cabinet by the permittee on a form prepared by the cabinet; or, if no address is shown on the application, then by certified or electronic mail to the address known to the cabinet. The notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation shall specify in what respects the permittee, person, or operator has failed to comply with this chapter or the regulations or orders of the cabinet and the remedial action required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which the notice or order applies. If the permittee, person, or operator has not reached an agreement with the cabinet or has not complied with the requirements set forth in the notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation within time limits set therein, the permit may be revoked or the operation terminated, after an opportunity for a hearing, by order of the cabinet, and the performance bond, if any, shall then be forfeited to the cabinet, provided that failure to attend a hearing shall be excused for good cause shown. Any bonding company or financial institution providing bond to the cabinet shall have the right to perform those measures necessary to secure bond releases if the bonding company or financial institution can demonstrate that it has the ability to perform the measures and will undertake to do so within a reasonable time frame. The bonding company, or financial institution providing the bond, may, at any stage of the reclamation process, pay the remaining encumbered balance of the bond and thereby discharge its obligation under the bond. Neither the surety company nor the financial institution may employ anyone to perform the measures who has been barred from mining pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> When a bond is forfeited consistent with the provisions of this chapter, the cabinet shall forfeit the entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> A permittee, operator, or person whose mining permit or operation has been revoked, suspended, or terminated or is at the time of the application in violation of this chapter or other applicable requirements as set forth in KRS 350.085 shall not be eligible to receive another permit or begin another operation or to have suspended permits or operations reinstated until he shall have complied with all the requirements of this chapter or submitted proof satisfactory to the cabinet under KRS 350.085 that the violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected in respect to all permits issued him, provided, further, that no permittee, operator, or person shall be eligible to receive another permit or begin another operation who has forfeited any bond unless the land for which the bond was forfeited has been reclaimed without cost to the state or the permittee, operator, or person has paid such sum as the cabinet finds is adequate to reclaim the lands. The cabinet shall not issue any permits to or allow future operations by any permittee, operator, or person who has demonstrated a pattern of willful violations of this chapter of such nature and duration with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate an intent not to comply with the provisions of this chapter, provided that no permit shall be denied on this basis without an opportunity for a hearing. The secretary shall promulgate regulations which implement this section. For the purposes of this section, if a corporate permittee has demonstrated a pattern of willful violations, then any subsequent application for a permit by that corporation, or any person who controls or has controlled that corporation, shall be denied.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> In the exercise of the secretary’s enforcement powers and authority under this chapter, the secretary, or an authorized representative of the cabinet, after inspection, shall immediately order the cessation of the condition or operation when he determines that the condition or operation creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or that the condition or operation is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant imminent environmental harm in violation of this chapter or the regulations pursuant to this chapter, or any permit condition. For purposes of this subsection, “imminent danger to the health and safety of the public” means the existence of any condition or practice, or any violation of a permit or other requirement of this chapter in a surface coal mining and reclamation operation, which condition, practice, or violation could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same conditions or practices giving rise to the peril, would not expose himself or herself to the danger during the time necessary for abatement.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> When a bond for an interim or preinterim program permit was forfeited prior to July 15, 1988, by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is not necessary to establish proper drainage and revegetation on the permit area for which it was submitted, the cabinet may use any remaining funds to supplement reclamation of other forfeited or released permit areas, if the other permit areas endanger public health and safety.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> When the bond for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation, the unused funds less any interest that has accrued shall be returned to the party from whom they were collected, subject to the cabinet’s right to attach or set off the proceeds under other state laws.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or the provisions of KRS Chapter 45A, when the bond, other than a surety bond or bond secured by a letter of credit, for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited and collected by the cabinet, and a person subsequently applies for a permit overlapping all or part of the disturbed area of the permit area for which the bond is forfeited, the cabinet may negotiate and enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped in exchange for all or part of the forfeited bond funds held by the cabinet, if requested by the applicant. If the applicant proposes to overlap only a part of the disturbed area the cabinet may enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the overlapped part of the disturbed area if the cabinet has retained a portion of the forfeited bond that is sufficient for the cabinet to reclaim the part of the disturbed area that is not overlapped. Any applicant under this subsection shall not be eligible for the benefits available under this subsection if the applicant has any ownership or control connection with the permittee or operator with respect to which the bond was forfeited. The amount of forfeited bond funds the cabinet may pay to the applicant shall be determined by the cabinet based upon the estimated cost for the cabinet to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped to the reclamation standards applicable to the original permit, but not to exceed the forfeited bond amount collected and held by the cabinet. Payments under this subsection shall be made only after release of the bond pursuant to KRS 350.093(4)(a) for those areas of the overlapping permit that are covered by the contract. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were disturbed under the forfeited interim permit may be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Areas where coal is not removed under the overlapping permit and the disturbances are for reclamation of the interim permit only shall be reclaimed to interim program standards. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were not disturbed under the forfeited interim permit shall not be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to exempt a person from the permitting, bonding, and reclamation requirements imposed in this chapter or to infringe upon the right of any surety to reclaim any permit or increment thereof to avoid bond forfeiture.</p>

Enact. Acts 1966, ch. 4, § 29; 2018 ch. 85, § 6, effective July 14, 2018.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I Findings and Purposes</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The party States find that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1.</b> Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every State are of basic significance.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2.</b> The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3.</b> Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4.</b> Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5.</b> The States are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The purposes of this compact are to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1.</b> Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2.</b> Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3.</b> Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party States which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4.</b> Assist the party States in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5.</b> Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II Definitions</b></p>
<p class="p7">As used in this compact, the term:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> “Mining” means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter; any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location; and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of farming or construction pursuant to KRS 350.245.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> “State” means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Territory or Possession of the United States.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III State Programs</b></p>
<p class="p7">Each party State agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1.</b> The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2.</b> The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV Powers</b></p>
<p class="p7">In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Interstate Mining Commission, established by Article V of this compact, such Commission shall have power to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1.</b> Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V The Commission</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby created an agency of the party States to be known as the “Interstate Mining Commission,” hereinafter called “the Commission.” The Commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each party State who shall be the Governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party State, each Governor shall have the assistance of an advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other public and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his State on the Commission. In any instance where a Governor is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the Commission, he shall designate an alternate, from among the members of the advisory body required by this paragraph, who shall represent him and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the Governor to the Commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The commissioners shall be entitled to one vote each on the Commission. No action of the Commission making a recommendation pursuant to Article IV-3, IV-7, and IV-8 or requesting, accepting or disposing of funds, services, or other property pursuant to this paragraph, Articles V(g), V(h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting: provided that action of the Commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, is present. The Commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The Commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The Commission shall have a seal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The Commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, and a treasurer. The Commission shall appoint an Executive Director and fix his duties and compensation. Such Executive Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Executive Director, the Treasurer, and such other personnel as the Commission shall designate shall be bonded. The amount or amounts of such bond or bonds shall be determined by the Commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party States, the Executive Director with the approval of the Commission, shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Commission’s functions, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The Commission may establish and maintain independently or in conjunction with a party State, a suitable retirement system for its employees. Employees of the Commission shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivor’s insurance provided that the Commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to the laws of the United States, to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Commission may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as it may deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The Commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any State, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association or corporation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The Commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any State, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Article shall be reported in the annual report of the Commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> The Commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The Commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party States.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> The Commission annually shall make to the Governor, legislature and advisory body required by Article V(a) of each party State a report covering the activities of the Commission for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been made by the Commission. The Commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VI Advisory, Technical, and Regional Committees</b></p>
<p class="p7">The Commission shall establish such advisory, technical, and regional committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which shall include private persons and public officials, and shall cooperate with and use the services of any such committees and the organizations which the members represent in furthering any of its activities. Such committees may be formed to consider problems of special interest to any party States, problems dealing with particular commodities or types of mining operations, problems related to reclamation, development, or use of mine land, or any other matters of concern to the Commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VII Finance</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The Commission shall submit to the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party State a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party State for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>

In determining such values, the Commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party States. Each of the Commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any party State. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article V(h) of this compact: provided that the Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Commission makes use of funds available to it under Article V(h) hereof, the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party States adequate to meet the same.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The accounts of the Commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party States and by any persons authorized by the Commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the Commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VIII Entry into Force and Withdrawal</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any four or more States. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other State upon its enactment thereof.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any party State may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the Governor of the withdrawing State has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the Governors of all other party States. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party State prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IX Effect on Other Laws</b></p>
<p class="p7">Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit, repeal or supersede any other law of any party State.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE X Construction and Severability</b></p>
<p class="p7">This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party States and in full force and effect as to the State affected as to all severable matters.</p>

Surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining shall not affect the eligibility of those lands for reclamation and restoration under this chapter after the release of the bond or deposit for a remining operation as provided under KRS 350.093.

Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation of property nor of trespass thereon. The moneys expended for such work and the benefits accruing to any such premises so entered upon shall be chargeable against such land and shall mitigate or offset any claim in or any action brought by any owner of any interest in such premises for any alleged damages by virtue of such entry: provided, however, that this provision is not intended to create new rights of action or eliminate existing immunities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The cabinet and its authorized representatives, agents, and contractors shall have the right to enter upon any property for the purpose of conducting studies or exploratory work to determine the existence of adverse effects of past coal mining practices and to determine the feasibility of restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of such adverse effects.

<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The Commonwealth shall have the power to acquire, by purchase, donation, devise, or condemnation, any land which is adversely affected by past coal mining practices if acquisition of such land is necessary for successful reclamation and that:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Title to all lands acquired pursuant to this section shall be in the name of the Commonwealth. The price paid for the land acquired under this section shall reflect the market value of the land as adversely affected by past coal mining practices. The Commonwealth may exercise the power of eminent domain against such land by filing a condemnation suit under the procedure of the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky. Provided, that when the Commonwealth acquires land adversely affected by past coal mining practices pursuant to the Abandoned Mine Lands Program and when such abandoned mine reclamation fund moneys are less than the purchase price, the Commonwealth shall be authorized to use whatever funds are available pursuant to KRS 350.156(3).</p>

The cabinet may avail itself of any services which may be provided by other state agencies or the federal government, and may compensate them for such services.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The cabinet shall have the power to backfill, grade, revegetate, and perform other acts of restoration and reclamation on lands acquired pursuant to this section.

The cabinet and any other agency and any contractor under a contract with the cabinet shall have the right of access to the land affected to carry out such reclamation.</p>

The proceeds of any such sale shall be credited to the abandoned mine reclamation fund. The cabinet, when requested after appropriate public notice, shall hold a public hearing, with the appropriate notice, in the county or counties in which lands acquired pursuant to this section are located. The hearings shall be held at a time which shall afford local citizens and governments the maximum opportunity to participate in the decision concerning the use or disposition of the lands after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> In addition to the authority to acquire and reclaim land for the purposes set forth in subsection (3) of this section, the Commonwealth is given authority to use money in the fund to acquire land by purchase, donation, devise, or condemnation and to reclaim such land and to transfer it to any political subdivision of the Commonwealth or to any person, firm, association, or corporation, if such is an integral and necessary element of an economically feasible plan for a project to construct or rehabilitate housing for persons disabled as the result of employment in the mines or work incidental thereto, persons displaced by acquisition of land pursuant to this section, persons dislocated as the result of adverse effects of coal mining practices which constitute an emergency as provided in KRS 350.585, or persons dislocated as the result of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from any cause, or any related commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, or governmental use of facilities. Such activities shall be accomplished under such terms and conditions as the Commonwealth shall require, which may include transfers of land with or without monetary consideration. Provided, that to the extent that the consideration is below the fair market value of the land transferred, no portion of the difference between the fair market value and the consideration shall accrue as a profit to such persons, firm, association, or corporation. No part of the funds provided under the abandoned mine reclamation fund may be used to pay the actual construction costs of housing.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The General Assembly finds that there has been a recent interest in the Commonwealth in the mining and processing of oil shale due to the critical need for fossil fuel which has developed in this country. The General Assembly further finds that the development of this fossil fuel could be of significant long-range benefit to the Commonwealth and to the United States of America, but that the unregulated extraction and processing of oil shale within the Commonwealth could cause soil erosion, water pollution, and the destruction of aesthetic and agricultural values. The General Assembly further finds that, in order to effectively regulate the extraction and processing of oil shale, the Energy and Environment Cabinet shall conduct extensive research concerning the process, waste production, and potentially adverse environmental impacts of such recovery operations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide such regulation and control of the mining and processing of oil shale as to minimize and prevent its adverse effects on the citizens and the environment of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that the Energy and Environment Cabinet is the most competent agency to regulate the extraction and processing of oil shale due to its expertise in the handling of the surface mining of other minerals and in the regulation of other sources of air and water pollution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The Energy and Environment Cabinet shall file with the regulations compiler reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to oil shale mining operations, which shall include strip mining as defined by KRS 350.010, the surface effects of underground mining of oil shale, and the in situ mining of oil shale by June 30, 1981. No person shall engage in the commercial mining or processing of oil shale until such time as the cabinet promulgates rules and regulations to provide standards for such mining.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> In promulgating regulations pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the secretary shall make written finding that the regulations promulgated are based on sound scientific and engineering data and are reasonably necessary to protect the people and environment of the Commonwealth from the adverse effects of oil shale extraction. The secretary shall promulgate regulations consistent with existing standards for land, water, and air protection. The secretary may conduct a public hearing on the subject of the cabinet’s regulation of the extraction and processing of oil shale for the purpose of collecting data and receiving public comments on this issue. The hearing will be held at a time and place to be determined by the secretary in accordance with the policy of the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Prior to the adoption of the regulations required by this section, any person may conduct core drilling, experimentation, removal of samples, or a pilot and demonstration project which involves the mining of not more than five (5) acres for the production of oil shale in any one (1) county. Such core drilling, experimentation, removal of samples, or pilot and demonstration project involving the mining of not more than five (5) acres for the production of oil shale in any one (1) county shall not be initiated until written notification of the intent to perform such operations shall be filed at least fifteen (15) days prior to commencement of such projects by registered mail by the mine operator with the secretary of the Energy and Environment Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and with the person(s) holding title to the surface of the land to be utilized for such operations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The secretary of the Energy and Environment Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky shall be granted the right to monitor such core drilling, experimentation, removal of samples, or pilot and demonstration project as it may deem necessary for the purpose of establishing sound and reasonable scientific and engineering data upon which rules and regulations pertaining to oil shale mining operations in the Commonwealth of Kentucky can be based.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The requirements of this section shall not apply to lands on which coal mining operations were being conducted on August 3, 1977, or under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter or where substantial legal and financial commitments in such operation were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Other provisions of this chapter relating to hearings to the contrary notwithstanding, any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected shall have the right to petition the cabinet to the extent such a petition would be consistent with subsections (2) and (3) of this section, to have a specific and well-defined area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, or to have such a designation terminated. Such a petition shall contain allegations of facts which shall be specific as to the petitioner’s designated area, including a justification that the criteria alleged occur throughout and form a significant feature, and shall be based upon objective evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. The cabinet shall make a determination or finding whether the petition is complete, incomplete, or frivolous. Within ten (10) months after the receipt of the petition, the cabinet shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the affected area, after appropriate notice and publication of the date, time, and location of such hearing, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the cabinet to implement this section, provided that when a permit application is pending before the cabinet and such application involves an area in a designation petition, the cabinet shall hold the hearing on the petition within ninety (90) days of its receipt. After a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected has filed a petition and before the hearing, any person may intervene by filing allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within sixty (60) days after such a hearing, the cabinet shall issue and furnish to the petitioner and any other party to the hearing, a written decision regarding the petition, and the reasons therefor. In the event that all petitioners stipulate agreement prior to the requested hearing and withdraw their request, such hearing need not be held. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an order, determination, finding, or decision by the cabinet or the secretary hereunder, any applicant, or any person with an interest which is or may be adversely affected and who is aggrieved by the order, determination, finding, or decision of the cabinet or secretary, may obtain judicial review thereof by appealing to the Circuit Court of Franklin County pursuant to the provisions of KRS 224.10-470.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> Any permittee, person, or operator who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto or who fails to perform the duties imposed by these provisions, except the refusal or failure to obtain a permit or other authorization as provided in this chapter, or who violates any determination or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be liable to a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the violation, and an additional civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day during which the violation continues, and in addition, may be enjoined from continuing the violations provided in this section. Any permittee, operator, or person who fails to abate a violation noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. Any person issued an order pursuant to KRS 350.130(4) shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation cited in the underlying notice of noncompliance issued therewith. No separate civil penalty shall be assessed for the order issued pursuant to KRS 350.130(4). Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment. The cabinet shall develop a method for calculating monetary penalties and shall promulgate it as an administrative regulation. The secretary or a designated representative, upon his or her own initiative or upon written request received within fifteen (15) days after the cabinet mails its proposed penalty assessment, may waive the use of the method for calculating monetary penalties if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case. If the secretary or his or her designated representative waives the use of the formula, he or she shall determine the appropriate penalty upon consideration of the permittee’s history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation, the seriousness of the violation, whether the permittee was negligent, and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. The penalties shall be recoverable in an action brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky by the cabinet. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto. All sums recovered shall be placed in the State Treasury, except those moneys collected in excess of eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000) in any fiscal year shall be deposited into the restricted fund account of the Office of the Commissioner of the Department for Natural Resources to be disbursed for the purposes set out in KRS Chapters 350, 351, and 352. All moneys previously deposited in the abandoned mine land enhancement fund shall be redeposited in the reclamation guaranty fund.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Any person or operator who engages in surface coal mining operations without first securing a permit, as provided in KRS 350.060, or any person who engages in coal exploration operations, exclusive of core drilling, without proper authorization, as required by the cabinet pursuant to KRS 350.057 or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, or any person or operator who engages in other mining operations, without proper authorization as required by this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, shall be liable to a civil penalty for damages to the Commonwealth of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) nor more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and in addition, may be enjoined from continuing the violations. Each day shall constitute a separate violation. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any permittee, person, or operator who fails to abate a violation of KRS 350.060 or KRS 350.029 or KRS 350.057, as noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement, shall be assessed an additional civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. However, the penalties provided in subsection (1) of this section shall apply in lieu of the penalties provided in this subsection where an operator or permittee through inadvertence has exceeded the boundaries or expiration date of the permit in effect at that time.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The cabinet shall bring an action for the recovery of penalties and bring an action for a restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, against any permittee, operator, or person violating or threatening to violate any of the provisions of this chapter or violating or threatening to violate any order or determination issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Any permittee, operator, or person who knowingly and willfully violates any of the provisions of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, or any determination or order issued pursuant to the sections of this chapter which have become final, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. Each day on which the violation occurs may constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5) (a)</b> Any person or operator who, in violation of KRS 350.060(1)(a) willfully and knowingly engages in surface coal mining operations without first obtaining a permit from the cabinet, or any person or operator who willfully and knowingly engages in coal exploration operations, exclusive of core drilling, without proper authorization, as required by the cabinet pursuant to KRS 350.057 or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, or any person or operator who willfully and knowingly engages in other mining operations without proper authorization as required by this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, with the intent to violate the laws, shall be guilty of a Class D felony.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Any person or operator who in violation of KRS 350.060(1)(b) willfully and knowingly receives, transports, sells, conveys, transfers, trades, exchanges, donates, purchases, delivers, or in any way derives benefit from coal removed from any surface mining operations conducted in violation of KRS 350.060(1)(a) or 350.057 shall be guilty of a Class D felony.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Any person who violates any of the provisions of KRS 350.600 or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto shall be subject to civil penalties of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Each day of continuing violation shall be deemed a separate violation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> Any permittee, operator, or person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained by the cabinet, shall upon conviction be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> Except as permitted by law, any permittee, operator, or person who willfully and knowingly resists, prevents, impedes, or interferes with the secretary or other personnel of the cabinet in the performance of duties pursuant to this chapter shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> When a corporate permittee violates any provision of this chapter or administrative regulation promulgated pursuant thereto or fails or refuses to comply with any final order issued by the secretary, any director, officer, or agent of the corporation who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out the violation, failure, or refusal shall be subject to the same civil penalties, fines, and imprisonment as may be imposed upon a person pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> Upon notice by the secretary that any surety has failed to comply with the provisions of KRS 350.032(3), the commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance shall revoke the surety’s certificate of authority to conduct insurance business within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> The cabinet, upon written request by any permittee, person, or operator subject to any penalty assessment under this section and pursuant to procedures, if any, set forth by administrative regulation and after consultation with the local county fiscal court, may allow as an alternative to the payment of any assessed penalty under this section the performance of in-kind reclamation, environmental rehabilitation, or similar action to correct environmental pollution. The in-kind work shall not substitute for those remedial measures mandated by the cabinet for the correction of any violations. The estimated cost of the in-kind work shall be greater than the penalty assessment. The cabinet’s Division of Abandoned Mine Lands shall have the authority to approve proposed in-kind projects and to recommend projects to the cabinet, and shall determine whether the estimated cost of the in-kind work exceeds the penalty assessment. For the purposes of this subsection, the cost of the in-kind work shall include only those expenditures for actual on-site reclamation or rehabilitation work, including direct equipment, personnel, and material cost, but excluding administrative overhead or transportation costs. Failure to perform the in-kind work as agreed upon by the person or operator subject to the penalty assessment shall reinstate the liability of the person, permittee, or operator for the full amount of the assessed penalty. The cabinet may prepare and promulgate administrative regulations as are necessary to implement and administer the provisions of this subsection.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> The Mine Safety Review Commission shall promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A to establish administrative hearings procedures to be followed in determining if violations of mine safety laws, including, but not limited to, violations that meet the criteria established in KRS 351.025(1) or (2), have occurred and to establish a process to review recommended orders from any hearing officers acting on behalf of the commission. The procedures shall follow the requirements of KRS Chapter 13B and this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The chair or a majority of the Mine Safety Review Commission may convene a meeting of the commission at which it shall consider whether to schedule a hearing regarding any licensee, coal operation, or other person involved in the mining of coal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If the commission determines that there is probable cause to believe that the licensee, coal operation, or other person against whom the department has made allegations of unsafe work practices or other violation of applicable law is guilty of an alleged violation, the commission shall schedule a hearing at which the department shall offer evidence in support of the allegations made by it. The licensee, coal operation, or other person against whom the allegations are made shall be given not less than twenty (20) days’ written notice of the charges against him, together with the date, time, and place at which the charges shall be heard, and of his opportunity to be represented by counsel, produce evidence and witnesses on his behalf, and examine the evidence and documents that may be produced against him. The commission may also be represented by counsel and shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, but its order shall be based upon competent evidence. Any licensee or other person summoned to appear at a hearing in the manner established in this subsection may, in writing, waive the notice required to be given to him.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The commission may proceed with its hearing of charges made by the department against any licensee, coal operation, or other person who, after being duly notified in accordance with the requirements of this section, fails to appear at or participate in the hearing and who fails to assert any legitimate basis for the failure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Within ninety (90) days after hearing, the commission shall issue an order in which it sets out its determinations concerning each matter coming before it. Copies of the order shall be provided to all parties to the hearing. The department shall carry out or enforce, as appropriate, the order of the commission, which may include, though not be limited to, the imposition of civil penalties, revocation, suspension, or probation of the mine license or the miner’s certification.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> The commission may modify a civil penalty or fine established under this chapter, under criteria established by the commission by administrative regulations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> In assessing monetary penalties within the limits provided in KRS 351.025, the commission shall consider the operator’s history of previous violations, the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the operator charged, whether the operator was negligent, the effect on the operator’s ability to continue in business, the gravity of the violation, the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of a violation, and whether a penalty has been imposed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act for a violation that arose out of the same set of facts or circumstances.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Where necessary in a blasting operation, the department may require that the operator submit a blasting plan to the department for approval.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> In all blasting operations, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the maximum peak particle velocity of the ground motion in any direction shall not exceed two (2) inches per second at the immediate location of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building, and the particle velocity at such location immediately after a period of one (1) second following the peak particle velocity produced by any charge shall not continuously exceed one-half (1/2) inch per second.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> Blasting operations without instrumentation will be considered as being within the limits set forth in this subsection if such blasting operations are conducted in accordance with rules and regulations of the department establishing the maximum amount of explosives to be used in a single charge and in a single subcharge within specified distances from any location provided by subsection (1) of this section. No more than 40,000 pounds of explosives may be used in any charge except with the approval of the commissioner. Regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to this subsection shall be in such terms that compliance therewith will assure compliance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> No two (2) consecutive subcharges containing the maximum permitted by the department pursuant to this subsection shall have a detonation time separated by less than eight (8) milliseconds, except that if the amount of explosive used in any subcharge is less than maximum permitted by the department pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the time delay between detonation times may be decreased in the same ratio.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Any blasting operation may be conducted without reference to any maximum amount or period provided by or pursuant to subsection (4) of this section if the operator of such blasting operation demonstrates by instrumentation that maximum particle velocity of the ground motion in any direction does not exceed the limits provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> Instruments for determining particle velocity as set forth in this subsection shall be limited to such specific types of devices as shall have been expressly approved by the department and the commissioner or his duly authorized agent may enter upon any premises for the purpose of conducting or supervising any necessary instrumentations provided by KRS 351.315 to 351.375.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> When blasting operations are contemplated which would result in ground vibrations that would have a particle velocity in any direction in excess of two (2) inches per second at the immediate location of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building, blasting operations may proceed after receiving written consent from the property owner or owners affected.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> When blasting operations, other than those conducted at a fixed site as a part of any industry or business operated at such site, are to be conducted within the vicinity of a pipeline or public utility, the blaster or person in charge of the blasting operations shall take due precautionary measures for the protection of the pipeline or utility, and shall give adequate notice to the owner or his agent that such blasting operations are intended. The blaster shall be subject to regulations promulgated by the department concerning such a blasting operation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> Blasting operations near streams shall be prohibited in all cases where the effect of the blasting is liable to change the course or channel of any stream without first obtaining a permit from the department which has been approved by the Division of Water in the Energy and Environment Cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> Blasting operations shall not be conducted within eight hundred (800) feet of any public highway, unless due precautionary measures are taken to safeguard the public.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(12)</b> Mudcapping in blasting operations shall be permitted only where it would endanger the safety of the workers to drill the rock or material to be blasted. If mudcapping is necessary, no more than ten (10) pounds of explosives shall be used for each charge.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(13)</b> When the use of detonating cord would cause severe air blast the department may cause all trunk lines to be covered by five (5) to six (6) inches of loose earth.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(14)</b> In blasting operations, flying rocks shall not be allowed to fall greater than one-half (1/2) the distance between the blast and a dwelling house, public building, school, church, or commercial or institutional building. Protective material shall be used to insure this limit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(15)</b> When a blast is about to be fired, ample warning shall be given to allow all persons to retreat to a safe place, and care shall be taken to ascertain that all persons are in the clear. Each operator shall follow a definite plan of warning signals that can be clearly seen or heard by anyone in the blasting area. The operator shall inform all employees at the operation as to the established procedure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(16)</b> No person shall use explosives in such manner that safety to persons or property is threatened.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(17)</b> The two (2)-inch-per-second maximum peak particle velocity as specified in subsections (3) and (8) of this section shall be construed as the threshold below which blasting damage is unlikely to occur. However, the department shall have the authority to promulgate regulations requiring more restrictive levels of maximum peak particle velocity when necessary to maintain consistency with federal statutes or regulations.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> A mine ventilation plan and any revision of an existing mine ventilation plan shall be suitable to the ventilation conditions and mining system of each mine. The mine ventilation plan and any revisions to the mine ventilation plan approved by the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration shall be submitted to the director or his or her authorized representative and incorporated into the license. All mine ventilation plans shall be set forth in printed form. The mine ventilation plan shall require the air quality throughout the mine to contain at least nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) oxygen and not more than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of carbon dioxide, and the volume and velocity of the air current shall be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases and dust, smoke, and fumes. A copy of the mine ventilation plan and any revisions to that plan shall be available to the miners and their representatives.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The ventilation of all underground coal mines shall be produced by means of mechanically operated fans located outside the mine in fireproof housing and offset at least fifteen (15) feet to one (1) side or above the opening, protected by explosion doors or weak walls and arranged so that ventilating current may be reversed if necessary. The fan shall be installed so as to prevent recirculation of mine air. The main fan shall be operated from a power circuit independent from the mine circuit. If inside auxiliary fans are required to ventilate working places the commissioner must first approve the installation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The licensee, superintendent, or foreman of every coal mine worked by shaft, slope, or drift shall provide and maintain for every mine two (2) separate and distinct escapeways, one (1) of which is vented by the intake air. However, if a mine was originally licensed prior to January 1, 1990, the commissioner may approve an alternate ventilation plan. Each active working section shall be ventilated by a separate split of intake air. In all mines the quantity of air passing through the last open crosscut between the intake and return in any pair or sets of entries shall be not less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. All working faces from which coal is being cut, mined, or loaded in a working section between the intake and return airway entries shall be ventilated with a minimum quantity of three thousand (3,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. The quantity of air reaching the last crosscut in pillar sections may be less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute if at least nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute is being delivered to the intake of the pillar line. The air current shall under any conditions have a sufficient volume and velocity to reduce and carry away smoke from blasting and any flammable or harmful gases.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> All mines shall maintain at least nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute at the points mentioned in subsection (3) of this section. The commissioner shall have the authority to require additional air in any mine when he deems it necessary for the safety of the employees.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> When the air from a split has passed through and has ventilated all the working places in an air split of a mine it shall then be designated as return air. Return-air courses shall not be designated as primary escapeways.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> As working places advance, breakthroughs for air shall be made not more than ninety (90) feet apart, except that where longwall or modern systems of mining are used the commissioner or his authorized representative may approve a greater distance between breakthroughs or the method of ventilating such longwall or modern systems of mining. If any breakthroughs between intake and return airways are not required for the passage of air or the travel of equipment, they shall be closed with stoppings. All permanent stoppings shall be substantially built with suitable incombustible or fire resistant material subject to the approval of the mine inspector so as to keep the working places well ventilated. All brattice cloth and ventilation tubing shall be flame resistant. Doors on the main haulways shall be avoided where practicable, and overcasts, built of concrete or other suitable material and of ample strength, shall be adopted. Where doors are used they shall be built in a substantial manner, and shall be hung so as to close automatically when unobstructed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> In a mine where methane can be found to an extent of one percent (1%) or more on the return of any one (1) split, the mine safety specialist, with the approval of the commissioner, may require the mine to be ventilated by the exhaust system, requiring the haulage roads and all feed wires to be located on the intake air and the electrical system to be so arranged that no wires carrying electrical current shall be on return air. A period of not more than ninety (90) days from date of notification shall be allowed to make the changes required.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The ventilation plan shall require all fans utilized in the ventilation plan to be in continuous operation unless the fan must be turned off for repairs or maintenance, during which time all persons must be withdrawn from the mine. After the mine fan is restarted following the completion of repairs or maintenance, it must be in operation for a sufficient period to ensure air quality and the equalization of the mine atmosphere. Within fifteen (15) minutes after a fan has been unintentionally stopped, all miners must begin withdrawing from the mine. If the fan is restarted before the miners reach the surface, the miners shall remain at the point of their retreat, and the area inby shall be preshifted prior to the miners returning to the section.</p>

This fact, taken together with the context of the citation, clearly indicates that Section 21 should have been substituted here so that KRS 352.010 is the appropriate statute to be cited.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> If, upon presentation to the Circuit Court of the petition, the answer of the trustee ad litem and the proof presented by the petitioner in such case, it appears to the court that development of the severed mineral interests will be advantageous to the unknown or missing owners, the court shall declare a trust in the lands or estate or interest therein, appoint a trustee therefor and authorize the trustee to sell, execute and deliver a valid mineral lease covering the severed mineral interests in and underlying the lands.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Should the court appoint a trustee pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court shall, in its decree, require the trustee to give a bond in favor of the owners of the severed mineral interest which is to be leased and shall fix the amount of the bond. The decree of the court shall further provide for all of the terms and provisions of the lease which the trustee is authorized to make. It shall be discretionary with the court as to whether or not the trustee’s sale of lease shall be public or private and the decree shall provide therefor, and if a public sale be authorized, the court shall in its decree fix and determine the notice to be given.

<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> The court shall not authorize a trustee’s lease upon the severed mineral interest of any owner whose identity and whereabouts is known, or can be ascertained by diligent inquiry, or is discovered as a result of the action brought hereunder; and any such owner may intervene as a matter of right at any time prior to the entry of judgment approving the trustee’s lease, for the purpose of establishing his title to the severed mineral interests, and if the mineral owners claim is established to the satisfaction of the court, the court shall dismiss the action as to the intervenor’s interest at plaintiff’s cost.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The trustee shall collect the proceeds, if any, from the sale of the lease and hold and invest the same for the use and benefit of the unknown or missing owners. The court upon its own motion or upon motion of the trustee may authorize the trustee to expend an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the funds collected by the trustee for the purpose of instituting a search for the unknown or missing owners.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Within seven (7) years after the date of first commercial production of the severed mineral interests under the trustee’s lease, any person being an unknown or missing owner of the severed mineral interest or any undivided portion thereof, may petition the Circuit Court to redocket the action in which the trustee’s lease was sought and approved in accordance with subsection (3) of this section and may thereupon present such proof as the court may deem necessary to establish his identity and title to the severed mineral interest or any portion thereof. If the court finds that the unknown or missing owners have established their identity and title, the trustee shall be directed to distribute the funds in his hands attributable to the unknown or missing owners’ interest, and shall assign all future proceeds from said lease to the owners as their interests appear and shall deliver to the owners a recordable instrument documenting their title to the severed mineral interest, which instrument shall bear the endorsement and approval of the Circuit Court on the face thereof.</p>

An order or final determination includes but is not limited to the issuance, denial, modification, or revocation of a permit, but does not include the issuance of a letter identifying deficiencies in an application for a permit, a registration or a certification, or other nonfinal determinations. Unless the cabinet considers that the petition is frivolous, it shall serve written notice of the petition on each person named therein, and shall schedule a hearing before the cabinet not less than twenty-one (21) days after the date of the notice unless the person complained against waives in writing the twenty-one (21) day period.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The right to demand a hearing pursuant to this section shall be limited to a period of thirty (30) days after the petitioner has had actual notice of the final determination or order complained of, or could reasonably have had notice.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The burden of proof shall be upon the party complaining of the order or final determination. Any party may offer into evidence all or any part of the record of the hearing which resulted in the order, and any other relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> All hearings under this chapter, except those before the commission, shall be held before a hearing officer, duly qualified to practice law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who may be a full-time employee of the cabinet, serve by contract, or be paid on a per diem basis at the discretion of the cabinet. After the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall, within sixty (60) days, make to the secretary a report and recommended order, which shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. If the secretary finds upon written request of the hearing officer that additional time is needed, the secretary may grant an extension. The hearing officer shall serve a copy of the report and recommended order upon all parties of record to the proceeding and their counsels, if any, and they shall be granted the right to file exceptions thereto within fourteen (14) days of receipt. Any party may submit a written response to exceptions within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the report and recommended order. Exceptions and responses not timely filed shall be noted but shall not be considered by the secretary in making a final order. Within ninety (90) days of the report or recommendation made by the hearing officer, the secretary shall consider the report, exceptions, responses to exceptions, and recommended order and decide the case. The decision shall be served by mail upon all parties and their attorney of record and shall be a final order of the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations, pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter and to the extent possible, consistent with those promulgated pursuant to KRS Chapter 224, establishing formal and informal hearing procedures by which any hearing shall, upon the written request of the operator, permittee, or other person, be held in the Energy and Environment Cabinet’s Office of Administrative Hearings in Frankfort, before an impartial hearing officer who is independent of any prosecutorial functions of the cabinet. The administrative regulations shall provide for the conduct of hearings and investigations of any matter relating to this chapter.

No person who presided at a prior hearing shall either preside at a subsequent hearing or participate in any further decision or subsequent administrative appeal in the same matter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Any party aggrieved by a final order of the secretary resulting from a hearing conducted pursuant to this section may appeal to the Franklin Circuit Court within thirty (30) days from the issuance of the final order. The party or parties affected by the final order shall file in the Circuit Court a petition, which states fully the grounds upon which a review is sought and shall assign all errors relied on. The cabinet shall be named respondent, and service shall be had on the secretary. Summons shall issue upon the petition directing the cabinet to send its entire record, properly bound, to the clerk of the Circuit Court after certifying that the record is its entire original record or a true copy. The record, when filed, shall become official and be considered by the Circuit Court on the review. After the case has been properly docketed in the Circuit Court, any party directly affected by the issues on appeal, may, upon notice to the parties, proper showing, and in the discretion of the court, be permitted to intervene. The court shall review the entire record and the findings and final order of the cabinet. No objection to the final order shall be considered by the court, unless the issue was raised before the cabinet or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The findings of the cabinet as to the facts shall be prima facie evidence of the facts found therein. The court shall review the entire record and the findings and final order of the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> The court may stay the order until the court shall enter its decree. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a decree affirming or setting aside the order or remanding the cause with directions to modify the order so that it shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.
