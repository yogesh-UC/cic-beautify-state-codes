<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall be known as the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall be interpreted to effectuate the following express legislative purposes:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The Commonwealth shall direct its efforts to promoting protection of children; to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to strengthening and maintaining the biological family unit; to ensuring that policies and practices utilized are supported by data and research and are monitored or measured for their effectiveness in achieving the intended results; and to offering all available resources to any family in need of them;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> It also shall be declared to be the policy of this Commonwealth that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1.</b> All efforts shall be directed toward providing each child a safe and nurturing home;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2.</b> Emphasis shall be placed on involving families in interventions developed for youth, providing families with access to services necessary to address issues within the family, and increasing accountability of the youth and families within the juvenile justice system;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3.</b> To the extent possible, out-of-home placement should only be utilized for youth who are high-risk or high-level offenders, and that low-risk, low-level offenders should be served through evidence-based programming in their community; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4.</b> As the population in Department of Juvenile Justice facilities is reduced through increased use of community-based treatment, and if staffing ratios can be maintained at the levels required by accreditation bodies, reductions of the number of facilities should be considered;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> The court shall show that other less restrictive alternatives have been attempted or are not feasible in order to insure that children are not removed from families except when absolutely necessary;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Any child brought before the court under KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall have a right to treatment reasonably calculated, through the use of evidence-based programs when available, to bring about an improvement of his or her condition and, to the extent possible, have that treatment administered in the county of residence of the custodial parent or parents or in the nearest available county;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> KRS Chapter 635 shall be interpreted to promote the best interests of the child through providing treatment and sanctions to reduce recidivism and assist in making the child a productive citizen by involving the family, as appropriate, and by advancing the principles of personal responsibility, accountability, and reformation, while maintaining public safety, and seeking restitution and reparation;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> KRS Chapter 640 shall be interpreted to promote public safety and the concept that every child be held accountable for his or her conduct through the use of restitution, reparation, and sanctions, in an effort to rehabilitate delinquent youth; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(g)</b> It shall further be the policy of this Commonwealth to provide judicial procedures in which rights and interests of all parties, including the parents and victims, are recognized and all parties are assured prompt and fair hearings.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Common law infancy defense does not apply to proceedings under the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 346 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1108 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2006), aff'd, 246 S.W.3d 448, 2007 Ky. LEXIS 241 (Ky. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code has extinguished the common law presumption that a child is without criminal capacity (the “infancy defense”), since a delinquency adjudication in juvenile court is not a criminal conviction under KRS 635.040, and allowing the presumption would frustrate the clinical and rehabilitative purposes of the Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 246 S.W.3d 448, 2007 Ky. LEXIS 241 (Ky. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Legislative Intent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of subsection (1) in giving the District Court the ability to review any information it may require regarding one of its orders is to safeguard the interests of the child, considering it welfare as being too precious a commodity to jeopardize by an incomplete or inadequate judicial review. Cabinet for Human Resources v. McDonald, 765 S.W.2d 581, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 175 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In line with the legislature’s expression in this section of the public policy to strengthen families in order to protect and care for children, children have a common-law right of action for the loss of parental consortium. Giuliani v. Guiler, 951 S.W.2d 318, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 74 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile may voluntarily waive the preliminary hearing required under KRS 640.010(2) and KRS 635.020(2) before the juvenile’s case may be transferred to the circuit court as: (1) KRS 600.010(2)(e) signals the legislature’s intent to allow a juvenile to waive any of the rights set out in the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, (2) the preliminary hearing is a dispositional, rather than an adjudicatory hearing, (3) if a defendant can waive his constitutional right to a jury trial, there is no reason he cannot also waive his right to a preliminary hearing, and (4) the circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile felony matters. Humphrey v. Commonwealth, 153 S.W.3d 854, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 147 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since KRS 635.060(4), (5), restrict the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated. N.T.G. v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 218, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 51 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ky. Const., § 230 and KRS 41.110, preventing the expenditure of the State’s money without the consent of the legislature, and KRS 453.010 and CR 54.04(1), restricting judgments for costs against the Commonwealth, did not prohibit the trial court’s order requiring the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to pay for counseling for a mother whose child was placed with the Cabinet; a purpose of the Unified Juvenile Code was to strengthen and maintain the biological family unit and to offer all available resources to a family in need of them, under KRS 600.010(2)(a). Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. v. Evans, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 52 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 831 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Inferences About Another Child.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Commonwealth’s position that from evidence proving dependency, or abuse or neglect, of one child, the same condition may be inferred about another child who lives in the same household, ran against the grain of not only the Juvenile Code, but also the notion of constitutional due process of law and familial realities as well. J.H. v. Commonwealth, 767 S.W.2d 330, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 204 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Less Restrictive Alternatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the lower court did not state that other less restrictive alternatives, such as probation, had been attempted or were not feasible in accordance with KRS 600.010(2)(c), a juvenile defendant’s commitment to the department of justice was erroneous. X.B. v. Commonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 459, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 81 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a juvenile proceeding in which the juvenile argued that the trial court erred because commitment was not the least restrictive alternative since an aunt was willing to take her and that the trial court should have made findings as to why commitment was the only option, the trial court’s failure to make written findings or state during the hearings what alternatives had been tried was not fatal to the commitment. The record was full of second chances, house confinement, foster care, and other alternatives that the Cabinet for Families and Children and the court tried in order to help the juvenile. K.F. v. Commonwealth, 274 S.W.3d 457, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 376 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Commitment of the juvenile was necessary to protect him from physical injury, and to the extent less restrictive alternatives were available, they were considered by the family court and determined unfeasible, KRS 600.010(2)(c), 600.020(35). J.S. v. Commonwealth, 304 S.W.3d 67, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 216 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court fully explored alternatives to commitment for defendant juvenile when it recognized that he had made progress in his foster home and that he had to be committed to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services in order to remain there. At defendant’s arraignment, the Cabinet explained that it had attempted to involve the family in a diversion program, and the court had subsequently allowed defendant to live with his father and then a relative, both of which arrangements ended unsuccessfully. D.G. v. Commonwealth, 355 S.W.3d 476, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 228 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile court retained jurisdiction over an offender to enforce a restitution order entered by the juvenile court after the offender turned 18 because KRS 600.060 authorized the use of contempt powers to enforce the restitution order. Commonwealth v. S.K., 253 S.W.3d 486, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 2008).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that the residences parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 97 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pre-trial order excluding evidence of sexual abuse on one of the child’s siblings that resulted in the removal of the siblings from the home was vacated as the disputed evidence was not barred under the doctrine of issue preclusion since the identity of the perpetrator was not established in a prior proceeding; the identity of the perpetrator was not material to the finding that the siblings were abused or neglected since KRS 600.020(1) required only a finding that a parent or guardian had created or allowed to be created a risk that the child would be the victim of sexual abuse or exploitation. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. v. R.H., 199 S.W.3d 201, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 259 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS 625.090(1)(a)1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under KRS 625.090(1)(a)3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct. App. May 18, 2007), rev'd, 2008 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 150 (Ky. Aug. 21, 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cabinet for Health and Family Services did not present substantial evidence that a parent’s children were abused and neglected as required under KRS 600.020(1). It was not shown that the children suffered any direct, emotional or physical injury from the parent, and the Cabinet witnesses testified that the parent was a nurturing parent and that the children were well-cared for by the parent. M.E.C. v. Commonwealth, 254 S.W.3d 846, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To find that KRS 620.030 does not apply, there must be a finding that the act committed upon the child is not an act of sexual abuse. For purposes of KRS Chapter 600, the definition of a neglected or abused child is set forth at KRS 600.020. If sexual abuse has occurred, then the mandatory reporting requirement in KRS 620.030 would have required the teacher to report this incident and such mandatory reporting would result in this being considered a ministerial rather than a discretionary act which would preclude the teacher from claiming qualified official immunity.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding that the father abused only one of the four children did not preclude the court from ordering the father to refrain from contact with all four children because KRS 600.020(1) permitted such a finding where a risk of abuse existed and did not require actual abuse. Z.T. v. M.T., 258 S.W.3d 31, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 206 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court properly found that a child was an abused or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and terminated the parental rights of the child’s minor mother under KRS 625.090 without receiving expert testimony as to the mother’s parenting potential upon adulthood because § 625.090(2)(e), (g) did not require proof that the minor parent would be unable to effectively parent the child when the parent reached the age of majority. Commonwealth v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS 600.020 was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS 620.100, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice. S.R. v. J.N., 307 S.W.3d 631, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 62 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the plain language of KRS 600.020(1), the definition of an abused child is limited to a scenario in which his or her parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision inflicted or committed abuse, allowed abuse to be inflicted or committed, or created or allowed to be created a risk of abuse. As a result, the mandatory reporting requirement of KRS 620.030(1) does not apply when a child inappropriately touches another child unless a parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision allows such inappropriate touching to be committed or creates or allows such a risk of abuse. Turner v. Nelson, 342 S.W.3d 866, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 96 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that was based on compounded inferences was insufficient to support a finding of a mother’s neglect of her children under KRS 600.020(1)(f); her failure to sign an “Aftercare Plan” to keep the father away from the children, without evidence that he posed a risk to them, was insufficient. K.H. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 358 S.W.3d 29, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 248 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>

A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> Unless otherwise exempted by KRS Chapters 600 to 645, the juvenile session of the District Court of each county shall have exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings concerning any child living or found within the county who has not reached his or her eighteenth birthday or of any person who at the time of committing a public offense was under the age of eighteen (18) years, who allegedly has committed a public offense prior to his or her eighteenth birthday, except a motor vehicle offense involving a child sixteen (16) years of age or older. A child sixteen (16) years of age or older taken into custody upon the allegation that the child has committed a motor vehicle offense shall be treated as an adult and shall have the same conditions of release applied to him or her as an adult. A child taken into custody upon the allegation that he or she has committed a motor vehicle offense who is not released under conditions of release applicable to adults shall be held, pending his or her appearance before the District Court, in a facility as defined in KRS 15A.067. Children sixteen (16) years of age or older who are convicted of, or plead guilty to, a motor vehicle offense shall, if sentenced to a term of confinement, be placed in a facility for that period of confinement preceding their eighteenth birthday and an adult detention facility for that period of confinement subsequent to their eighteenth birthday. The term “motor vehicle offense” shall not be deemed to include the offense of stealing or converting a motor vehicle nor operating the same without the owner’s consent nor any offense which constitutes a felony;</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Unless otherwise exempted by KRS Chapters 600 to 645, the juvenile session of the District Court of each county or the family division of the Circuit Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings concerning any child living or found within the county who has not reached his or her eighteenth birthday and who allegedly:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Is beyond the control of the school or beyond the control of parents as defined in KRS 600.020;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Actions brought under subsection (2)(d) of this section shall be considered to be nonoffender actions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> Actions brought under subsection (2)(f) of this section shall be considered to be mental health actions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(7)</b> Nothing in this chapter shall deprive other courts of the jurisdiction to determine the custody or guardianship of children upon writs of habeas corpus or to determine the custody or guardianship of children when such custody or guardianship is incidental to the determination of other causes pending in such other courts; nor shall anything in this chapter affect the jurisdiction of Circuit Courts over adoptions and proceedings for termination of parental rights.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(8)</b> The court shall have no jurisdiction to make permanent awards of custody of a child except as provided by KRS 620.027.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(9)</b> If the court finds an emergency to exist affecting the welfare of a child, or if the child is eligible for the relative or fictive kin caregiver assistance as established in KRS 620.142, it may make temporary orders for the child’s custody; however, if the case involves allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, no emergency removal or temporary custody orders shall be effective unless the provisions of KRS Chapter 620 are followed. Such orders shall be entirely without prejudice to the proceedings for permanent custody of the child and shall remain in effect until modified or set aside by the court. Upon the entry of a temporary or final judgment in the Circuit Court awarding custody of such child, all prior orders of the juvenile session of the District Court in conflict therewith shall be deemed canceled. This section shall not work to deprive the Circuit Court of jurisdiction over cases filed in Circuit Court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(10)</b> The court of each county wherein a public offense, as defined in subsection (1) of this section, is committed by a child who is a resident of another county of this state shall have concurrent jurisdiction over such child with the court of the county wherein the child resides or the court of the county where the child is found. Whichever court first acquires jurisdiction of such child may proceed to final disposition of the case, or in its discretion may make an order transferring the case to the court of the county of the child’s residence or the county wherein the offense was committed, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(11)</b> Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the court from holding a child in contempt of court to enforce valid court orders previously issued by the court, subject to the requirements contained in KRS 610.265 and 630.080.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(12)</b> Except as provided in KRS 635.060(4), 630.120(5), or 635.090, nothing in this chapter shall confer upon the District Court or the family division of the Circuit Court, as appropriate, jurisdiction over the actions of the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet in the placement, care, or treatment of a child committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice or committed to or in the custody of the cabinet; or to require the department or the cabinet to perform, or to refrain from performing, any specific act in the placement, care, or treatment of any child committed to the department or committed to or in the custody of the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(13)</b> Unless precluded by KRS Chapter 635 or 640, in addition to informal adjustment, the court shall have the discretion to amend the petition to reflect jurisdiction pursuant to the proper chapter of the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(14)</b> The court shall have continuing jurisdiction over a child pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, to review dispositional orders, and to conduct permanency hearings under 42 U.S.C. sec. 675(5)(c) until the child is placed for adoption, returned home to his or her parents with all the court imposed conditions terminated, completes a disposition pursuant to KRS 635.060, or reaches the age of eighteen (18) years.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1. Legislative Intent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of this section in giving the District Court the ability to review any information it may require regarding one of its orders is to safeguard the interests of the child, considering its welfare as being too precious a commodity to jeopardize by an incomplete or inadequate judicial review. Cabinet for Human Resources v. McDonald, 765 S.W.2d 581, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 175 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the Kentucky Legislature conferred sole and exclusive authority upon the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to determine the appropriate placement of a child committed to its care in KRS 610.010(11) (now (12)), pursuant to Ky. Const., §§ 27, 28, the trial court erred in restricting where the Cabinet could place two (2) children. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. ex rel. A.W. v. Huddleston, 185 S.W.3d 222, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 47 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Curfew Violation Not Status Offense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) is not authorized to require its court designated workers to process juvenile curfew violators as public offenders under this section; therefore, respondent city was expressly prohibited from requiring its court designated workers to process juvenile curfew violators as status offenders under the definition in KRS 600.020. Covington v. Court of Justice, 784 S.W.2d 180, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 13 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Juvenile Court Authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The juvenile court did not have the authority to sentence an eighteen (18) year-old defendant to confinement in a juvenile facility for a car theft committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday. Jefferson County Dep't for Human Services v. Carter, 795 S.W.2d 59, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Express statutory authority anticipated that a juvenile court had the power to hold a child in contempt as KRS 610.010(10) (now (11)) specifically provided that nothing in “this chapter” would prevent a District Court from holding a child in contempt of court to enforce valid court orders previously issued by the court, KRS 610.265(1), 610.265(5) (now (3)) and 635.055 each set out provisions for the detention of a juvenile who was charged with being in contempt of court, and KRS 635.083(1) gave a juvenile court continuing jurisdiction over a juvenile who was convicted or adjudged delinquent of three (3) or more offenses, this jurisdiction continued even after the service of incarceration or other court-ordered punishment in the form of conditional discharge, and violation of the terms and conditions of conditional discharge could be punished as contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile court had the authority to hold a public offender in contempt for violating the terms of her probation, but the court should refrain from using its contempt authority to punish violations of probation unless it found that other options were either inappropriate or unavailable. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a public offender was found in contempt for violating the terms of her probation, significant due process considerations came into play, and, while her counsel’s stipulation to a violation of probation was adequate to establish a violation, it could not serve as the basis for finding the offender guilty of contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 610.010(11) (now (12)), restricting the trial court’s authority over the actions of the Cabinet concerning the placement, care, or treatment of a child committed to it, did not restrict the trial court’s authority to order the Cabinet to pay for drug abuse treatment for the mother because the mother’s treatment did not relate to the child’s treatment. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. v. Evans, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 52 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 831 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order modifying the amount of restitution that a juvenile was directed to pay was affirmed because KRS 610.010(13) (now (14)) granted the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to review a previously entered restitution order. Further, the order was not untimely as CR 59.05 did not apply to the entry of the dispositional order. D.F. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 81 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 499 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there was precedent and a clear statement in KRS 610.010(13) (now (14)) that as a general rule juvenile court jurisdiction did not extend to adults, a circuit court erred when it inferred such an extension with respect to outstanding restitution orders to former juveniles who had turned 18. Nothing in KRS 413.090 conveyed jurisdiction. S.K. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 154 (Ky. Ct. App. May 26, 2006), rev'd, 253 S.W.3d 486, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a general rule, KRS 610.010(13) (now (14)) limits juvenile court jurisdiction to minors. Neither the court’s contempt power nor the limitations period for an action on a judgment implies an exception to that rule for restitution obligors. S.K. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 154 (Ky. Ct. App. May 26, 2006), rev'd, 253 S.W.3d 486, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Federal Jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Federal District Court and not state District Court had jurisdiction over juvenile for crimes committed on Fort Knox military reservation since by KRS 3.030 the Kentucky Legislature has expressly granted jurisdiction to federal courts for matters occurring on the premises of Fort Knox and such statute does not conflict with this section. United States v. Juvenile Male, 939 F.2d 321, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 15266 (6th Cir. Ky. 1991).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Appellate Jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a Circuit Court enters a judgment terminating parental rights to a child who was previously committed to the Cabinet for Human Resources, the District Court loses its jurisdiction to review the earlier commitment order. (Decided under prior law) Cabinet for Human Resources v. D.S., 746 S.W.2d 87, 1988 Ky. App. LEXIS 30 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over and, therefore, properly dismissed a juvenile’s appeal from an order of an elected Circut Court judge sitting in Family Court which required the juvenile to cooperate in counseling, undergo a drug and alcohol screening, and to schedule a gynecological examination before the next hearing date; the juvenile should have taken her appeal to the Circuit Court pursuant to the Family Court rules of practice. T.A. v. Byer, 13 S.W.3d 629, 2000 Ky. LEXIS 27 (Ky. 2000).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>6. Circuit Court Jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court had jurisdiction to enter custody orders as to a child who was originally presented to a hospital in Kentucky with life-threatening injuries, and who was transferred to a hospital in Tennessee by air lift on that same date; however, an order permitting the Cabinet to terminate life sustaining treatment for the child was improper because the best interests of the child were secondary to the overriding and paramount right of the mother to a due process adjudication of termination. Until those rights were formally adjudicated, the Cabinet was not permitted to terminate treatment. D.K. v. Commonwealth, 221 S.W.3d 382, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 93 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Firearm enhanced drug offense is actually charged at the higher level regardless of the procedural circumstances. Therefore, a circuit court properly acquired jurisdiction in a juvenile case because transfer order was facially valid where a district court found probable cause that appellant committed the offense of drug trafficking with a firearm enhancement; moreover, the trial court made two sets of findings, one concerning mandatory findings and one about the discretionary factors. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 363 S.W.3d 11, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 25 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>7. Removal From Home State.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court abused its discretion in relieving the Cabinet for Human Resources of its responsibility, under an original order, to return the children to their home state of New York from where they had been removed from proper custody. (Decided under prior law) Waters v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 736 S.W.2d 365, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 565 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>8. Guilty Pleas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant juvenile was wrongly designated as a status offender after a family court found him in contempt because the court did not engage defendant in any sort of meaningful discussion concerning the consequences of his guilty plea, nor did it determine or assure whether he made it voluntarily. The court did not ask defendant about his state of mind or if anyone had pressured him to make the plea, it did not explain to defendant that he had the option of pleading not guilty and thus becoming entitled to a hearing, and it did not ascertain whether he was aware of the constitutional rights that he waived as a result of his admission. D.G. v. Commonwealth, 355 S.W.3d 476, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 228 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Entry of a guilty plea did not preclude the consideration of whether a transfer order in a juvenile case was facially invalid, and a waiver rule did not apply to a facially insufficient transfer order. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 363 S.W.3d 11, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 25 (Ky. 2012).</p>

<p class="p7">If it appears to the court, by affidavit or by sworn testimony, that the child is a danger to himself or the community, or is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare is being harmed or threatened with harm to such a degree that his best interest requires that his custody be immediately changed by the court from the original custodian to another, the judge may sign an order giving temporary custody of the child to a suitable custodian consenting to temporary custody. However, if this case involves allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, no emergency removal or temporary custody orders shall be effective unless the provisions of KRS Chapter 620 are followed; and, if the case involves allegations of mental illness, the provisions of KRS Chapter 645 shall be followed. As a part of such order, the court may direct that the child shall be taken into custody by the peace officer serving the summons or by any other peace officer and placed as directed by the court. In any event, a copy of the temporary custody order shall be served on the parent, guardian or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child when the summons is served. The temporary custody order shall be effective until the case is heard on its merits or until modified by the court.

<p class="p7">If it appears from the investigation required in KRS 610.100 or otherwise that the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of any child, or the estate of any child, who has been found to fall within the purview of KRS Chapters 600 to 645 and who has been left in his own home or in the home of a relative, placed on probation or placed in a foster home or boarding home, or in the care of a public or private facility or agency, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet, is able to contribute to the support of the child, the court shall enter an order requiring the parent or estate to pay a reasonable sum for the support, maintenance, or education of the child. The order shall direct that the money be paid to the circuit clerk to be disbursed as ordered by the court or be paid to the person, facility, agency, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or cabinet to which the child was committed or probated. On application and on such notice as the court may direct, the court may make alterations in the requirement for contribution. The court may issue such orders necessary to compel payment of the sum due. The enforcement of a sentence imposed on a parent who fails to comply with the order of the court may be suspended at the discretion of the court, but the suspension may be revoked at the discretion of the court upon the failure of the parent to obey further orders of the court. This section shall not apply when the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child was the victim of the child’s criminal conduct under KRS Chapters 635 or 640, or filed the complaint against the child under other provisions of the Unified Juvenile Code.</p>

<p class="p7">A parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of a child is charged with the control of such child and shall have the power to exercise parental control and authority over such child. In any case where a child is adjudicated a public offender and placed on probation, if the court finds at the hearing that the person having custody of such child has failed or neglected to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority, and that such failure or neglect is the proximate cause of the act or acts of the child upon which the adjudication is based, the court may require such parent to enter into a recognizance with sufficient surety, in an amount of not more than five hundred dollars ($500), conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the conditions of probation of such child. If the child thereafter commits a second act and is by reason thereof adjudicated a public offender, or violates the conditions of probation, and the court finds at the hearing that the failure or neglect of such parent to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority or to faithfully discharge the conditions of probation of such child on the part of such parent, is the proximate cause of the act of the child upon which such second finding is based, or upon which such child is found to have violated the conditions of his probation, the court may declare all or a part of the recognizance forfeited and the amount of such forfeited recognizance shall be applied in payment of any damages which may have been caused by such child, if there be such damages, otherwise, the proceeds therefrom, or part remaining after the payment of damages as aforesaid, shall be retained by the court to apply to any future damages resulting from the act or acts of said child before he reaches his eighteenth birthday, at which date the remaining proceeds shall be returned to the parent or guardian. The provisions of this section as it relates to failure or neglect of parents to subject a child to reasonable parental control and authority shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other sections of KRS Chapters 600 to 645 relating to failure or neglect to exercise such parental control or authority.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A system of selective placement of juveniles in the county jail for dispositional and predispositional purposes, although for limited periods of time, constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it was treating, for punitive purposes, the juveniles as adults and yet not according them, for due process purposes, the rights accorded to adults.

Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (3) of this section, KRS 61.878(1)(k) and 620.050(4) are aimed at protecting juveniles, and not adults who are criminally prosecuted for victimizing juveniles. OAG 93-ORD-42.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A transcript of grand jury testimony is a record subject to the exclusive control of the judiciary.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The deletion of juvenile law enforcement records, per subsection (3) of this section and KRS 61.878(1)(<i>l</i>), from an existing database of arrest records is not equivalent to the production of a record in a specially tailored or nonstandardized format within the meaning of KRS 61.874(3), thus, the Division of Police is required to discharge this duty under KRS 61.878(4), provide the requested records, and bear the cost of redaction.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the shroud of secrecy and confidentiality mandated by this section and KRS 610.070 is to protect the juvenile, and clearly this purpose was uppermost in the minds of the General Assembly; it was intended that trials of juveniles not be publicized in the news media, as such publicity would possibly deprive the juvenile of a fair trial and, more particularly, would likely diminish his or her prospect for rehabilitation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 600.020(12) provides that the Unified Juvenile Code applies to matters conducted in the juvenile session of District Court, in light of KRS 610.070(3), this section, and Const., § 115, the public and press are to be excluded not only from all juvenile proceedings at the District Court level, but from all appellate proceedings stemming therefrom. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 48 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To exclude the press at the district level, but admit them at the appellate level would tend to nullify the original intent and purpose of the Legislature and the wholesome policy of the Uniform Juvenile Act.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Confidentiality of juvenile court records under the Kentucky Uniform Juvenile Code, KRS 610.340 did not violate a press association’s First Amendment right of access to the courts because (1) the right of access was not extended to juvenile proceedings, and (2) the presumption of openness did not apply to juvenile proceedings as they were historically closed to the public and public access to such proceedings would frustrate the purpose of the juvenile courts.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to allow a juvenile expert from his attorney’s office to review the juvenile court records of several of the victims because defendant provided no evidence that the dispositional information would be exculpatory, but merely only made vague references that what transpired in the juvenile cases would be part of his defense and would be exculpatory.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7">The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. sec. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
<p class="p7">It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;</p>

It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.

Children have certain fundamental rights which must be protected and preserved, including but not limited to, the rights to adequate food, clothing and shelter; the right to be free from physical, sexual or emotional injury or exploitation; the right to develop physically, mentally, and emotionally to their potential; and the right to educational instruction and the right to a secure, stable family. It is further recognized that upon some occasions, in order to protect and preserve the rights and needs of children, it is necessary to remove a child from his or her parents.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS 600.020 was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS 620.100, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice.

Since the permanency order in question in this case was not a “custody decree” within the meaning of KRS Chapter 403, KRS 403.340 is inapplicable, and the Family Court was required to consider the petition for custody as if there had been no prior custody determination.

As a result, the mandatory reporting requirement of KRS 620.030(1) does not apply when a child inappropriately touches another child unless a parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision allows such inappropriate touching to be committed or creates or allows such a risk of abuse.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section provides that agencies providing services to children, such as schools, must cooperate with the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) and provide assistance and information, such interviews should be conducted in a manner that causes the least disruption to the students’ school schedule and the procedures vary if the allegations of student abuse are against school personnel. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the police desire to talk with a student who is a victim of a crime, then the school authorities should use their best judgment in determining whether the parents should be contacted. In the event that the officer is investigating allegations of dependency, neglect or abuse, the school should allow the interview to occur at school. The school should consult with the officer before the school officials inform the parents that an interview has taken place. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>School officials should use their discretion and confer with the police officer in deciding whether to be present when the court designated worker or the police questions a student. If the child is a victim of abuse, then the child should have input on choosing a trusted adult to sit in during the interview. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the school is not required to notify the parents before the Cabinet for Human Resources talks with the students, the fact that the parents cannot be reached is immaterial. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The school system is required pursuant to this section to permit social workers from the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to come into the school and talk with students regarding investigations of dependency, neglect or abuse. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether school personnel should be present when the social workers question the students is a decision that is best left to the discretion of the Cabinet for Human Resources’ social worker conducting the interview. OAG 92-138.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child who does not receive necessary medical care due to his parents’ religious belief may be considered an abused or neglected child; accordingly, the reporting requirements of subsection (1) of this section and the investigation requirements of KRS 620.050(3) are mandatory and must be followed in cases involving the religious exemption contained in KRS 600.020(1).

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires schools to continue to allow the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to interview children on school premises without consent of parents in the course of an abuse investigation if that is the course of action determined appropriate by the CHR. OAG 87-33.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Department for Social Services acted properly when it refused to make available for inspection to the alleged perpetrator of child abuse the names of informants and those portions of the statements of a judge and an informant wherein those parties set forth personal opinions, observations, and recommendations not related to the child abuse investigation and the findings resulting from that investigation. OAG 87-82.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The public agency’s refusal to furnish records and documents to the requesting party relative to an investigation of an alleged instance of child abuse and neglect was supported by subdivision (1)(j) of KRS 61.878 and subsection (4) of this section. OAG 88-4.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cabinet for Human Resources acted consistently with the Open Records Laws to the extent that it withheld from inspection the names of informants which spawned its investigation pursuant to KRS 61.878(1)(a) and (j) and subdivision (4)(a) of this section, and to the extent that it denied inspection of the verbal complaint or oral allegations made by an individual to an employee of the cabinet. However, the cabinet acted inconsistently with the Open Records Law to the extent that it denied inspection of the written complaint which initially spawned the investigation, although, the names of informants contained within the written complaint may properly be withheld. OAG 91-33.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where person requesting documents regarding detention of student at a school and the report and findings of an investigation conducted by the Department for Social Services did not demonstrate that he fell under any of the statutorily recognized classifications of this section or KRS 61.878 or that his particular situation warranted the release of the requested material, his request was properly denied. OAG 91-93.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) is applicable to information obtained as a result of a joint investigation by the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Kentucky State Police. OAG 91-173.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section clearly requires that the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Department for Social Services withhold from all persons information acquired as a result of an investigation conducted pursuant to this section, unless the requesting party can demonstrate that he or she satisfies one of the requirements set forth in subsection (4)(a) through (4)(f) of this section. Thus where, although the requesting party was currently involved in a custody dispute with his former wife, she was the custodial parent, and the allegations of abuse were not substantiated, the requesting party could not be said to have satisfied the requirements of subsection (4)(e) of this section and his open records request was properly denied. OAG 92-53.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (4) of this section KRS 61.878(1)(k) and KRS 610.320(3) are aimed at protecting juveniles, and not adults who are criminally prosecuted for victimizing juveniles. OAG 93-ORD-42.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky State Police improperly relied on subsection (4) of this section, KRS 61.878(1)(a) and (k), and KRS 610.320(3) in denying a request to inspect the files generated in the course of its investigation into a candidate for county sheriff who was charged with sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful transaction with a minor. Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case. OAG 93-ORD-42.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless the Kentucky State Police is acting as the Cabinet for Human Resources’ designated representative in conducting a joint investigation into allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, as opposed to independently conducting an investigation into possible criminal charges against an adult, subsection (4) of this section does not operate to authorize nondisclosure of the records it compiles. OAG 93-ORD-42.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the shroud of secrecy mandated by KRS 620.050(4) is “not intended to protect the identities of adults and employees of a public agency charged with violations of the criminal laws,” but is instead intended to protect the affected families, and in particular, the affected children, the Cabinet for Human Resources could not persuasively argue that it was bound by the confidentiality provision found at KRS 620.050(4) in witholding unsubstantiated complaints of abuse against its employees, and, at the same time, that it was free to release most, if not all, of the remaining records it compiled in its investigation of alleged employee misconduct.

A letter prepared by a social worker does not invest her with the status of custodial parent or legal guardian. Nor has she produced a court order directing disclosure of the disputed records to her.

Since this statute addresses an option for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to follow at the conclusion of a child protection investigation that does not result in removing a child from the parent or legal guardian's home, in codification the Reviser of Statutes created a new section of KRS Chapter 620, which addresses child abuse and neglect investigations, as a more appropriate statutory designation under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> If, after completion of the temporary removal hearing, the court finds there are reasonable grounds to believe the child is dependent, neglected or abused, the court shall issue an order for temporary removal and shall grant temporary custody to the cabinet or other appropriate person or agency. Preference shall be given to available and qualified relatives of the child considering the wishes of the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision, if known.

Preference shall be given to available and qualified relatives of the child considering the wishes of the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision, if known. The child may also be placed in a facility or program operated or approved by the cabinet, including a foster home, or any other appropriate available placement. However, under no circumstance shall the child be placed in a home, facility, or other shelter with a child who has been committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for commission of a sex crime as that term is defined in KRS 17.500, unless the child committed for the commission of a sex crime is kept segregated from other children in the home, facility, or other shelter that have not been committed for the commission of a sex crime.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> If the court finds there are not reasonable grounds to believe the child is dependent, neglected or abused, or if no action is taken within seventy-two (72) hours, the emergency custody order shall be dissolved automatically and the cabinet or its designee shall return the child to the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision. A request for a continuance of the hearing by the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision shall constitute action precluding automatic dissolution of the emergency custody order.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> When the court issues a temporary order for the custody of a child, the court may order that, within two (2) weeks, arrangements be made for the child to receive a thorough medical, visual, and dental examination by a professional authorized by the Kentucky Revised Statutes to conduct such examinations. The costs of the examination shall be paid by the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> The child shall remain in temporary custody with the cabinet for a period of time not to exceed forty-five (45) days from the date of the removal from his home. The court shall conduct the adjudicatory hearing and shall make a final disposition within forty-five (45) days of the removal of the child. The court may extend such time after making written findings establishing the need for the extension and after finding that the extension is in the child’s best interest.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(6)</b> If custody is granted to a grandparent of the child pursuant to this section, the court shall consider granting reasonable visitation rights to any other grandparent of the child if the court determines the grandparent has a significant and viable relationship with the child as established in KRS 405.021(1)(c).</p>

Further, when the father’s counsel urged the consideration of at least some form of visitation, the court rejected it with no explanation. T.C. v. M.E., 603 S.W.3d 663, 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 54 (Ky.

<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Upon consent by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the child may be declared a ward of the state and custody vested in the cabinet or in any child-placing agency or child-caring facility licensed by the cabinet or in another person if all persons with parental rights to the child under the law have had their rights terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. If the other person is not excepted by KRS 199.470(4), a grant of permanent custody shall be made only if the proposed custodian has received the written approval of the secretary or the secretary’s designee for the child’s placement.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court exceeded its authority where, although it found sufficient evidence to terminate parental rights, it declined to do so provided that the parents comply with all the conditions detailed in the court’s order. Cabinet for Human Resources v. J.B.B., 772 S.W.2d 646, 1989 Ky. App. LEXIS 82 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Factors Considered by Court.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absence, voluntary or court-imposed, may be a factor to consider in determining whether the children have been neglected. (Decisions under prior law.) J.H. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 704 S.W.2d 661, 1985 Ky. App. LEXIS 719 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where for reasons other than poverty alone, the incarcerated father continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or was incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement, and where the incarcerated parent never contributed to the economic well-being of the family when with them, the trial court was correct in involuntarily terminating his parental rights. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute requires a finding (1) that the child, by clear and convincing evidence, is an abused or neglected child; (2) that the termination would be in the best interest of the child; and (3) that one or more of the factors set out in subsection (1)(a)-(f) (now (2)(a)-(c), (e) and (f)) of this section are present. R. C. R. v. Commonwealth, 988 S.W.2d 36, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 138 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to support termination of a mother’s parental rights where the mother had been incarcerated since the birth of the child at issue for reasons directly related to the abuse of an older child, social worker testified that parenting instructions provided did not carry over from one (1) visit to another, and a psychological associate testified that the mother’s history in prison included two (2) suicide attempts and self-mutilation. M.P.S. v. Cabinet for Human Resources ex rel. S.A.S., 979 S.W.2d 114, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 66 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before a circuit court may terminate a parent’s rights, it must find, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that the child is an abused or neglected child, as defined by KRS 600.020(1); and (2) that termination would be in the child’s best interest. After that threshold is met, a court must find the existence of one of the numerous grounds recited in KRS 625.090(1), including abandonment, infliction of serious physical injury or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or neglect in providing access to basic survival needs, in order to terminate parental rights. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court properly terminated the parental rights of a minor mother under KRS 625.090 without receiving expert testimony as to the mother’s parenting potential upon adulthood because § 625.090(2)(e), (g) did not require proof that a minor parent would be unable to effectively parent a child when the parent reached the age of majority. Commonwealth v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the child’s best interests would be served if the mother’s rights were terminated, given the evidence that (1) the mother did not have stable housing and was dependent on her boyfriend, (2) she did not pay any child support, (3) the child had special needs based on his drug addiction at birth, and (4) the child was in a foster home, and the child recognized the providers as his parents. D.J.D. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 350 S.W.3d 833, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 259 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regarding abandonment, neither parent saw the child for more than one year, neither parent worked on his or her case plan, both had child support arrearages, and there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court’s decision to terminate the parents’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rights, and this was not clearly erroneous. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court found that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents with the child, and considering the neglect and parents’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lack of insight and lack of progress on their case plans, the trial court properly found that termination was in the child’s best interests. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by finding that at least on ground listed in KRS 625.090(2) existed because: (1) at the time of the termination of parental rights hearing the children had been in the custody and control of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services for over 24 months and for a period of not less than six months, and for reasons other than poverty alone; (2) the parents failed to provide essential parental care and protection for the children, including clothing, shelter, medical care, or education; (3) the parents had not had any contact with their children since September 2010; and (4) the parents did not complete all required substance abuse orders and recommendations, individual counseling services, or parenting classes. C.A.W. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 391 S.W.3d 400, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 24 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of parental rights was proper because the court found that the State had provided all reasonable services; there was ample testimony that both the mother and the children had been offered a number of services throughout the time the children were in foster care and that the services were fully utilized. C.H. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 399 S.W.3d 782, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 116 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It appeared that the trial court relied only on the mother’s incarceration as a ground for termination, but that was just one factor to be considered. M.L.C. v. Cabinet, 411 S.W.3d 761, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 136 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because a child was found to be abused and neglected based on the infliction of an emotional injury; the child suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the mother's mental illness made it incapable for her to care for the child. Moreover, the mother inflicted emotional injury to the child, failed to provide adequate parental care and supervision, and failed to provide the essentials of life for the child's overall well-being; termination was in the best interest of the child, reunification efforts were made, and the child's welfare would have improved if termination was ordered. B.E.K. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 487 S.W.3d 457, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 40 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not err in determining that the grounds in this section were present after a witness testified that in his professional opinion the mother’s disability was such that she was unlikely to improve to a degree that would permit her to give adequate care to the child and there were no services that would abate the concerns if the child were returned to the mother. Commonwealth v. K.S., 585 S.W.3d 202, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 382 (Ky. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the child was neglected as she was born with amphetamines in her system that came from the mother’s use of amphetamines prescribed to her, but she did not inform her physician of her pregnancy; she continuously abused drugs over the two-year period after the child had been removed; she went from one abusive relationship to another and did not complete her protective parenting class; and she did not pay child support; because there was no reasonable expectation of improvement in the mother’s situation within a reasonable amount of time; and because the child had been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months preceding the filing of the petition to terminate. 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 223.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err when it admitted into evidence the files from the dependency, neglect, and abuse proceedings of the child and her three siblings because the trial court made independent findings regarding the child’s neglect based on the testimonial evidence produced at trial and did not simply rely on the dependency, neglect, and abuse adjudications; the abuse or neglect of other children in the family was relevant to the current termination proceedings; and the documents were admissible because they were not excluded by hearsay, and were self-authenticating public documents. 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 223.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Abuse and Neglect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence showing that the defendants’ children lived in a filthy home, suffered from malnutrition, sores and impetigo and were frequently absent from school supported a judgment terminating parental rights. (Decisions under prior law.) Church v. Department for Human Resources, 555 S.W.2d 602, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 791 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although incarceration for an isolated criminal offense may not constitute abandonment justifying termination of parental rights, incarceration is a factor to be considered, particularly so where father was incarcerated for the rape of the half-sister of the two (2) children involved. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995 Ky. LEXIS 134 (Ky. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although testimony consisting of children’s out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse would be improper in a criminal case, in a termination of parental rights action statements were properly admitted as additional evidence of parental conduct. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 134 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a foster parent does not qualify as an expert witness competent to testify as to the existence of sexual abuse, question posed to foster parent as to whether she believed that the children had been sexually abused was not objectionable nor unfairly prejudicial in bench trial terminating parental rights of mother. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 134 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in failing to terminate a mother’s parental rights to her four children where, by clear and convincing evidence, the State demonstrated that the children were placed in foster care by the mother because she could not deal with their problems, she had no interaction with them for nearly a year and they were in foster care for over three years, the mother had exposed the children to sexual abuse and exploitation and refused to acknowledge the same, and she was unable and unwilling to care for their needs. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order terminating a father’s parental rights was affirmed where, inter alia, father had no contact with the child for several years, and provided no financial support for 31 months; while the father claimed he did not know where to send support payments, the parties’ agreement included the proper address. B.T.R. v. J.W., 148 S.W.3d 294, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 290 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that the residences the parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS 600.020(1) and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006 Ky. LEXIS 97 (Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS 625.090(1)(a)1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under subsection (1)(a)3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 158 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct. App. May 18, 2007), rev'd, 2008 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 150 (Ky. Aug. 21, 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Grant of petition for adoption without the consent of the biological father, who had undergone gender reassignment surgery, was, in effect, a proceeding to terminate the father’s parental rights based on abuse and neglect. The grant was proper because the evidence showed that the minor child suffered major depression, suicidal ideation, a decline in school performance, physical symptoms and withdrawn behavior, and the child testified the child felt abandoned. M.B. v. D.W., 236 S.W.3d 31, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 346 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of a mother’s parental rights was proper under KRS 625.090(2)(c) as the mother had abused her children or allowed them to be abused by a stepfather. J.M.R. v. Commonwealth, 239 S.W.3d 116, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 407 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Colvard v. Commonwealth, 309 S.W.3d 239, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 62 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of a mother’s and a father’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was in their children’s best interests because there was ongoing domestic violence between the mother and the father and the parents and the children, the parents did little to resolve their drug and alcohol dependency, the parents continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or were incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, one child was sexually abused by her parents and her uncles, another child was deemed a high suicide risk, and the parents failed to make sufficient progress toward identified goals as set forth in the court-approved case plan which would have allowed for the children’s safe return. C.R.G. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Fam. Servs., 297 S.W.3d 914, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 215 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding that mother stipulated to abusing the child based on prenatal drug use met the first prong of the test under KRS 625.090. D.J.D. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 350 S.W.3d 833, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 259 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of parental rights was inappropriate pursuant to KRS 625.090(5) because the parents were loving, they had the potential to learn at least some appropriate parenting skills, and they had repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to learn and change their behavior at the request of Cabinet for Health and Family Services. D.G.R. v. Commonwealth, 364 S.W.3d 106, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 36 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 600.020(1)(a)(2) allowed a finding by a court of neglect or abuse where the risk of abuse existed, and in this termination case, the child tested positive for marijuana at birth and the parents admitted to using such before and during the pregnancy, such that there was sufficient evidence to remove the child from the home in order to ensure her safety. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Parents conceded that the child was neglected or abused since they did not contest such. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 301 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by determining that the children were abused and/or neglected under KRS 600.020, 625.090 because the parents admitted that their children were neglected as a result of their substance abuse issues and admitted that because of their lack of supervision of one child she was injured and sustained a bruise to her face. C.A.W. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 391 S.W.3d 400, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 24 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of this section clearly mandates that the trial court must find that each parent satisfies the three prongs found in the terminate the parental rights statute, including whether the child qualifies as an abused or neglected child. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. K.H., 423 S.W.3d 204, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 13 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Substantial evidence supported conclusion that son was abused or neglected under this section, including evidence that the father had not seen his son since his removal from his mother in June 2009, he refused to provide documentation that he had a steady job or was making child support payments, and he had a very limited understanding of his son’s psychological needs. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. K.H., 423 S.W.3d 204, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 13 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of the mother’s parental rights was improper because the evidence did not show that the child was neglected; while a doctor stated that the mother’s limited intellect gave rise to a risk of neglect, that is not the same as neglect but rather indicates a child is dependent. The mother never had custody of the child, never neglected the child, and complied with her case plan, and while she had developmental disabilities, that alone was insufficient to render her behavior as neglectful. K.S. v. Commonwealth, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 224 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2018), rev'd, 585 S.W.3d 202, 2019 Ky. LEXIS 382 (Ky. 2019).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the agency was not required to amend its permanency goal from reasonable efforts/reunification to termination/adoption prior to the filing the termination petition, because the agency failed to prove the requirements for termination in KRS 625.090, the trial court properly dismissed its petition.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1. Purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory reasons underlying the termination process relate to parental abandonment, neglect and abuse so substantial that the child must be legally cut off from the parent. They justify a legal structure that provides finality and blocks every path to further litigation to reestablish a connection to parents whose rights have been terminated. Litigation by grandparents, by the family of such parents, would frustrate and circumvent the termination decree. The statutory language of severance required in the termination decree now expresses no exception, and none may be created by implying an exception from the grandparents’ visitation statute. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where natural father voluntarily terminated his parental rights to a daughter born out of wedlock, he had no legal relationship to the child and, therefore, no standing to challenge her adoption. (Decisions under prior law.) Hill v. Garner, 561 S.W.2d 106, 1977 Ky. App. LEXIS 891 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sum and substance of this statute is to “terminate” all parental connection with no exceptions such as provided in KRS 199.520(2) for stepparent adoptions. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mother of a handicapped child had failed to obtain legal authority to fund and manage a trust, which was funded by a settlement received from those allegedly responsible for the child’s condition, as she was not appointed by the District Court, did not obtain approval of the trust, failed to file settlements or accountings, and administered the trust with no court supervision and control; nevertheless, her ex-husband was not entitled to half of the trust funds upon the child’s death under the laws of descent and devise because his parental rights had been previously terminated. Scott v. Montgomery Traders Bank &amp; Trust Co., 956 S.W.2d 902, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 162 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Stepparent Adoption.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The overriding considerations expressed through the termination and adoption statutes for cutting, finally and irrevocably, all connections to the biological parent and his family where there has been a final order terminating parental rights and where there has been an adoption introducing the child into a new family, simply do not apply where there has been only a stepparent adoption with no prior legal severance of the bond to the grandparents. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>4. Grandparents’ Rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Paternal grandparents were awarded visitation rights, under the “best interest of the child” standard, where the granddaughter’s father had died and the granddaughter was subsequently adopted by her stepfather. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Paternal grandmother whose son’s parental rights to an infant were terminated on the basis of abandonment for a period exceeding five (5) years, was not entitled to visitation rights. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Paternal grandparents of children whose parents died and who were then adopted by a maternal first cousin and her spouse, had no legal relationship with their grandchildren and thus were not awarded visitation rights. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989 Ky. LEXIS 8 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because KRS 625.100 specifically recognized that persons related to a child had an elevated status when custody of the child was awarded after a termination of the parents’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rights, and because the grandparents had a legally cognizable interest in the child, they could intervene as a matter of right in the custody determination. L.J.P. v. Cabinet Family Servs., 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 368 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 26, 2008), rev'd, 316 S.W.3d 871, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 120 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Right to Counsel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an indigent mother and father were not afforded counsel at a goal change hearing held before the District Court, as well as during other critical stages of the dependency action, an order terminating their parental rights was improper, as such detrimentally affected the termination proceeding before the Circuit Court when the court made an erroneous finding of fact that the child had been in foster care for 15 of the preceding 22 months.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the juvenile does not directly use the firearm but is charged with a complicity offense, the record must reflect sufficient evidence to show probable cause that complicity has occurred. Since this review occurs at the charging stage rather than at a trial of guilt or innocence, this means that there must be allegations that, if true, would support a probable cause finding that the juvenile acted with the kind of culpability with respect to the result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense when she solicited or conspired with others, aided in planning or committing the offense, or failed to prevent the offense when legally required to do so. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the principal offense is a result offense, KRS 502.020(2) requires that, in order to be guilty of the crime by complicity, a defendant must act with the culpability required to obtain the result of the charged offense and cause that particular result as an element of the offense by soliciting or conspiring with another, aiding another in planning or committing the offense, or failing to make a proper effort to prevent the offense when there is a legal duty to do so. Use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury is the necessary element that separates first- and second-degree assault. However, to support first-degree assault by complicity, the proof in a youthful offender transfer hearing must further establish allegations that the accused was indeed complicit. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 635.020(4) provides that transfer is mandatory when a firearm is used in commission of the underlying offense; by treating offenses in which a firearm is used differently, the General Assembly has declared a different public policy, one of essentially no tolerance of gun-related crimes by juveniles, and in light of that policy, it would be unjust to allow a juvenile who has used a firearm to avoid prosecution as a youthful offender. If the district court errs in finding that the gun was not used by a juvenile, then it fails to comply with the mandate of KRS 635.020(4), which creates a risk that the administration of justice will suffer; in such a case, a writ of mandamus would be appropriate. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application of KRS 635.020(4) to a juvenile charged with complicity to a felony must first focus on the strong language of this section, which mandates that a child charged with a felony in which a firearm, whether functional or not, was used in the commission of the offense, must be transferred to the circuit court for trial as an adult; while the statute includes some other qualifiers that are important, the language sets forth the legislative intent to place juveniles who are involved in gun crimes in a different position than other public offenders. This is sometimes referred to as an automatic transfer rule, but that is only true if all the statutory elements are met: there must be probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a felony, that a firearm was used in commission of that felony, and that the juvenile was 14 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony. KRS 635.020(4), and yet the seriousness with which the legislature regards the use of guns by juveniles is clearly presented. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a gun is used in the commission of a felony, the district court’s first inquiry must be whether that use was by the juvenile directly or whether the use can be attributed to the juvenile. When the juvenile is charged as a principal, that is, having directly committed the charged offense and used a gun in the process, this inquiry is relatively simple. For example, first-degree assault is the criminal offense in this case involving a firearm. The first-degree assault statute, KRS 508.010, requires that a defendant must intentionally cause serious physical injury by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To be transferred under KRS 635.020(4), the child must at least be complicit in another person’s use of a firearm. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Transfer statute requires that, if a juvenile defendant is charged with a felony, the juvenile shall be transferred to circuit court if a firearm was used in the commission of the offense; all this requires is that there be a felony charge and that a firearm be used in commission of the felony. Further, there is no language in KRS 635.020(4) stating that the firearm must actually be used by the juvenile charged; rather, the statute only requires that the firearm be used in the commission of the felony the juvenile is charged with, not that the juvenile was the one who wielded the firearm. Because the transfer language in the statute is mandatory and because of the obvious policy the legislature has expressed with regard to juveniles using firearms in crimes, complicity to commit an offense involving use of a firearm requires transfer when an offense involving direct use of a firearm would. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 4 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That a firearm offense committed by means of complicity can be the basis of transfer under KRS 635.020(4) does not mean that all such charged offenses must be transferred; the charge alone does not decide whether a transfer occurs. Pursuant to KRS 635.020(4), transfer only occurs for such charges if, following a preliminary hearing, the district court finds probable cause to believe that the child committed a felony, that a firearm was used in the commission of that felony, and that the child was fourteen years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The juvenile court did not have the authority to sentence an eighteen (18) year-old defendant to confinement in a juvenile facility for a car theft committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday. Jefferson County Dep't for Human Services v. Carter, 795 S.W.2d 59, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under subsection (5) of this section, a juvenile public offender may not be committed to a secure juvenile detention facility for more than 90 days, even if the offender is charged with multiple incidents of criminal behavior. Commonwealth v. W.E.B., 985 S.W.2d 344, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 170 (Ky. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile court was without authority to order the juveniles confined in adult detention facilities for public offenses which they committed before they reached the age of 18; since KRS 635.060(2), (3) expressly envisioned situations beyond the 18th birthday, it was clear that the only authorized dispositions for the juveniles were either placement on probation, home incarceration, or supervision for a period not to exceed 1 year, sentencing the juveniles to adult detention facilities was not within the parameters of the authorized dispositions. D.R.T. v. Commonwealth, 111 S.W.3d 392, 2002 Ky. App. LEXIS 2031 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 635.060(4) provided that a juvenile offender who was older than age 14 but younger than age 16 could be confined for a period not to exceed 45 days but KRS 600.060 stated that notwithstanding any other provision of KRS Chs. 600 to 645, the inherent contempt power of the court was not diminished, so, because KRS 600.060 specifically addressed the juvenile court’s contempt powers, it controlled over the more general limitation on sentencing of public offenders contained in KRS 635.060(4), and a juvenile court was allowed to sentence a public offender to 60 days in detention for being in contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 91 (Ky. Ct. App. May 2, 2003), aff'd, 163 S.W.3d 4, 2005 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order modifying the amount of restitution that a juvenile was directed to pay was affirmed because KRS 610.010(13) granted the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to review a previously entered restitution order. Further, the order was not untimely as CR 59.05 did not apply to the entry of the dispositional order. D.F. v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 81 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 499 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, age 17, was properly sentenced for second degree robbery as an adult pursuant to KRS 635.020(4); because a gun was used in the commission of the crimes and because defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court, she fell within the purview of KRS 635.020(4) and not KRS 635.020(2). Chipman v. Commonwealth, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 349 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 2008), review granted, transferred, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 135 (Ky. Feb. 11, 2009), rev'd, 313 S.W.3d 95, 2010 Ky.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since KRS 635.060(4), (5), restricts the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated. N.T.G. v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 218, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 51 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>3. Raising Charges.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where charges against juvenile for third-degree burglary and second-degree criminal mischief were raised to second-degree and first-degree, respectively, after commencement of the trial, but in both cases complaints clearly stated facts to support the raised charges, and where juvenile proceeding took place under the Unified Juvenile Code which makes no distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors, such defects were not tantamount to an additional or different offense, and did not mislead the defendant or cause him to suffer any prejudice. A.E. v. Commonwealth, 860 S.W.2d 790, 1993 Ky. App. LEXIS 98 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a juvenile who had been charged with a capital offense was transferred to Circuit Court as a youthful offender where she was acquitted on the capital charge, and convicted of a Class C felony, the trial court was without authority to sentence her pursuant to KRS 640.030, but was limited to the much more lenient dispositions provided by this section. Canter v. Commonwealth, 843 S.W.2d 330, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 181 (Ky. 1992).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Minors are permitted to waive any of the rights set out in the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, unless otherwise provided, so long as the minor, by the express terms of a plea agreement, validly and knowingly waives the rights, including the right to be sentenced under KRS 635.060. However, a juvenile defendant can not be found to impliedly waive a right to which the defendant was not explicitly made aware. Kozak v. Commonwealth, 279 S.W.3d 129, 2008 Ky.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When it was found, under RCr P. 11.42, that defendant received ineffective assistance at a juvenile transfer hearing, defendant could not receive a new transfer hearing because, while defendant was presumptively prejudiced by counsel’s abdication of responsibility to defendant at a critical stage of the proceedings, (1) a juvenile court adjudication would not benefit defendant due to defendant’s advanced age, and (2) de novo review of the propriety of transfer was foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine, as the Kentucky Supreme Court decided the issue on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Robertson, 431 S.W.3d 430, 2013 Ky. App. LEXIS 66 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a juvenile was adjudicated for being complicit in criminal mischief, it was not plain error to hold the juvenile solely liable for restitution for the resulting damage because (1) KRS 635.060 granted such discretion, (2) an interpretation of KRS 533.030 granting such authority in adult cases applied to juvenile cases, and (3) the order did not contravene the Juvenile Code’s purposes or affect the juvenile’s substantial rights, nor was the order issued at a shocking or jurisprudentially intolerable proceeding. R.S. v. Commonwealth, 423 S.W.3d 178, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 6 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>9. “Involving a deadly weapon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly determined that the plain meaning of the phrase, “involving a deadly weapon,” in the statute at issue was broad enough to include both the use and possession of a deadly weapon because, in common usage, “to involve” meant “to include,” as used in the statute, the plain meaning of the phrase was that a deadly weapon was present during or somehow included in the commission of an act, and the statute allowed the juvenile court options, one of which is committing a child to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice. R.T. v. Commonwealth, 583 S.W.3d 1, 2018 Ky. App. LEXIS 265 (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because a plain reading and straightforward application of subsection (4)(a)(1) revealed the juvenile court had the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; because defendant had three prior adjudications, the juvenile court had the authority to commit him to the DJJ for the fourth adjudication. L.H. v. Commonwealth, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 89 (Ky. Ct. App. May 17, 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because subsection (4)(a)(1) gave the juvenile court the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; the decision to conserve judicial resources by holding one disposition hearing to dispose of all four adjudications in no way impacted the nature and character of the prior adjudications because they remained separate and distinct adjudications. L.H. v. Commonwealth, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 89 (Ky. Ct. App. May 17, 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant juvenile had the requisite criminal history prior to disposition, satisfying the purpose underlying subsection (4)(a)(1), because he repeatedly engaged in disruptive, volatile behavior resulting in the Commonwealth filing multiple petitions against him, which resulted in multiple misdemeanor or Class D felony adjudications; defendant demonstrated an unwillingness to live within the parameters of the law. L.H. v. Commonwealth, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 89 (Ky. Ct. App. May 17, 2019).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the juvenile court ordered a jurisdiction be transferred to the Circuit Court and where it appeared positively form the record that no hearing of any sort was held in the Juvenile Court, the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to try the cause and should have remanded the matter to the Juvenile Court.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a juvenile court assumes jurisdiction of an alleged offense committed by a juvenile, the court must either adjudicate the matter or conduct a hearing and transfer the case to Circuit Court.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a juvenile court hearing confined itself solely to the determination whether the case should be transferred to the Circuit Court, the subsequent trial in the Circuit Court did not subject the defendant to double jeopardy.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The transfer of a juvenile accused of murder and robbery to Circuit Court was proper where the juvenile court found that the offenses were committed against persons rather than property, that the offenses had sufficient prosecutive merit to warrant transfer to Circuit Court and that the offenses were aggressive, premeditated, willful and committed without remorse. (Decided under prior law) Mayes v. Commonwealth, 563 S.W.2d 4, 1978 Ky. LEXIS 335 (Ky. 1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where it was contended that there were irregularities in the appointment of the commissioner who heard the case in juvenile court and ordered the defendants waived to the grand jury to be dealt with as adults, but the order of transfer was signed by the regular juvenile judge in the orders of the day, the order was valid.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process requires that the reasons for a transfer of a juvenile case to the Circuit Court be stated with particularity in order to permit meaningful review, but unless appellate review is sought it cannot be claimed that the transfer order is void.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The juvenile court did not err in transferring a rape and robbery case to the Circuit Court where the evidence showed that the defendant was 17 and one-half years old at the time the offenses were committed, that the defendant had a record of other juvenile offenses, that there was no adequate manner to protect the public from the defendant, and that there were no adequate facilities in which the defendant could have been committed so as to afford a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation. (Decided under prior law) Pevlor v. Commonwealth, 638 S.W.2d 272, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 291 (Ky. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1149, 103 S. Ct. 794, 74 L. Ed. 2d 998, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3136 (U.S. 1983).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to indict and convict the defendant of first-degree burglary, or to use that offense as an aggravating circumstance authorizing the death penalty, notwithstanding that he had not been charged with that offense in juvenile court, since it is the offender, rather than the offense, which is transferred to Circuit Court. Osborne v. Commonwealth, 43 S.W.3d 234, 2001 Ky. LEXIS 69 (Ky. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the context of the conflicts in the wording of KRS 610.015(1) and KRS 640.010, the appellate court believes the Legislature intends that the criminal rules governing preliminary hearings should apply to preliminary transfer hearings in juvenile court; thus, KRS 610.342 is not a rule of discovery, RCr 3.07 controls, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a juvenile is not entitled to complete discovery until probable cause is established.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus because the Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal; the district court's denial of the motion to transfer defendant juvenile to circuit court was an interlocutory order because further proceedings were necessary in district court to dispose of all the issues in the case. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 429 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2017), review denied, ordered not published, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Feb. 7, 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus after a district court denied its motion to transfer defendant juvenile because the Commonwealth demonstrated a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if the district court was proceeding erroneously and correction of the error was necessary and appropriate in the interest of orderly judicial administration; the mandatory findings under subsection (2)(a) can be the proper subject of a writ of mandamus. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 429 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2017), review denied, ordered not published, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Feb. 7, 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth a writ of mandamus and ordered a district court to find probable cause for first-degree wanton endangerment because the district court applied the wrong legal standard, and it abused its discretion in finding that probable cause only existed for second-degree wanton endangerment; the grand jury, not the district court, was charged with the task of determining whether defendant juvenile was properly charged with a felony or misdemeanor. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 429 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2017), review denied, ordered not published, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Feb. 7, 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature's use of the broader term “offense” in subsection (2)(a), rather than the specific term “felony,” indicates that the district court's probable-cause determination should be focused on whether there is probable cause to support the named offense; but in cases where the offense can be prosecuted as either a felony or a misdemeanor, the district court is not responsible for determining whether there is probable cause for the felony charge. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017 Ky. App. LEXIS 429 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2017), review denied, ordered not published, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 59 (Ky. Feb. 7, 2018).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where expert testimony as to defendant juvenile’s progress and need for additional treatment was relevant to the issue of sentencing and because<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 533.010(2),<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>532.050(6), and RCr 11.02 required the trial court to consider probation and alternative sentencing prior to sentencing, the trial court erred in failing to consider the evidence before sentencing pursuant to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 640.030(2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley v.

Hickman v. Commonwealth, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 127 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 28, 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial courts were not constrained to sentence the juvenile offenders under the terms of the Violent Offender Statute, KRS 439.3401, when the courts were addressing the status of juvenile offenders when they reached the age of 18, pursuant to KRS 640.030; and the sentencing constraints set forth in KRS 439.3401 did not apply to the KRS 640.030 proceedings.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutorily mandated 18-year-old hearing was not a final sentencing because, under KRS 640.030, the trial court had the authority to place a youthful offender on probation or conditional discharge, to return the youthful offender to juvenile custody to complete a treatment plan whereupon he would be finally discharged, or to order transfer to adult corrections. The Circuit Court did not have authority to modify, alter, or otherwise dismiss the underlying sentence. Commonwealth v. Carneal, 274 S.W.3d 420, 2008 Ky.
