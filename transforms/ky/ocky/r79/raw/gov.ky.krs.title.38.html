<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court rejected defendant’s argument that his opportunity to controvert the contents of a presentence investigation (PSI) report pursuant to KRS 532.050 applied to a victim impact statement pursuant to KRS 421.520 so as to afford him the opportunity to also controvert the contents of a victim impact statement because, unlike KRS 532.050, KRS 421.520 did not specifically afford a defendant an opportunity to controvert the contents of a victim impact statement. Although KRS 421.520(1) permits a victim impact statement to be included in a PSI report or submitted by itself if a defendant waives the PSI report, nothing in either statute suggests that the rules governing challenges to PSI reports also apply to victim impact statements; absent such a provision or case law supporting such an application, the trial court did not err by declining to afford defendant such an opportunity.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the existence or nonexistence of a contempt, civil or criminal, requires the resolution of a factual issue, the trial court may itself resolve that issue upon the basis of a hearing in which the alleged offender is afforded a fair opportunity to present a defense, but trial court may not in such a case inflict a fine greater than $500 and incarceration for more than six (6) months except upon the unanimous verdict of a jury finding the offender guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although contempt proceedings do not lie for perjury except where the truth of the facts or the falsity of the evidence is judicially known, the trial court has to find defendant’s testimony false in order to inflict punishment for a contempt that is dependent on the premise that the party allegedly in contempt is not telling the truth.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the order imposing conditional imprisonment was obviously for the purpose of compelling the contemnor to testify in the felony prosecution of two defendants, the rendition of a guilty verdict against the two (2) defendants and the discharge of the jury constituted a final disposition of the prosecution so as to discharge the contemnor from his imprisonment for contempt. Hardin v. Summitt, 627 S.W.2d 580, 1982 Ky. LEXIS 228 (Ky. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The justification for imprisonment under this section depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court’s order and it is untenable to suggest that the term “final disposition” as used in this section requires a contemnor to remain incarcerated during the pendency of an appellate process which may continue for several years.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In prosecution for having liquor for sale in local option territory, comment by prosecutor that defendant had not taken stand and explained to what institutions the liquor was to be furnished violated this section and required reversal of the judgment. Hicks v. Commonwealth, 311 Ky. 492, 224 S.W.2d 916, 1949 Ky. LEXIS 1198 (Ky. 1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution as a habitual criminal, comment by the Commonwealth’s Attorney that no witness had taken the stand to deny the identity of the defendant as the same person who had been previously convicted did not violate this section. Foster v. Commonwealth, 415 S.W.2d 373, 1966 Ky. LEXIS 7 (Ky. 1966), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 914, 87 S. Ct. 2128, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1355, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1175 (U.S. 1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remark by prosecutor that evidence for the state was uncontradicted was not improper as drawing attention to the failure of defendant to testify. Fanelli v. Commonwealth, 418 S.W.2d 740, 1967 Ky. LEXIS 229 (Ky. 1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Though in summation to the jury the prosecutor at one point commented on defendant’s failure to testify, the other evidence was so overwhelming that any constitutional violation of the privilege against self-incrimination was not prejudicial. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 503 S.W.2d 485, 1972 Ky. LEXIS 3 (Ky. 1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Argument that a defendant has failed to contradict the prosecutor’s evidence has been upheld as a proper form of argument; accordingly, comments by a prosecutor which did not directly refer to the defendant’s failure to testify, but only referred to the fact that the defense did not put on any witnesses at all, were a proper form of argument. Haynes v. Commonwealth, 657 S.W.2d 948, 1983 Ky. LEXIS 283 (Ky. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Comment on the failure to testify must be manifestly intended to reflect on the accused’s silence or of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it as such, to constitute prejudice. Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 484 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S. Ct. 2626, 110 L. Ed. 2d 646, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3101 (U.S. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was no indication of an extraordinary case in which a constitutional violation had probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, the petitioner’s argument that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument violated his privilege against self-incrimination was barred by procedural default, in the absence of a contemporaneous objection. Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 484 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S. Ct. 2626, 110 L. Ed. 2d 646, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3101 (U.S. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Murder conviction was reversed based on a prosecutor’s comment on defendant’s failure to tell police where a shot was fired from because the reference was clearly to the failure to testify at trial since such a question was not asked during police interrogation; the record showed that the proof of defendant’s guilt was not overwhelming, defense counsel objected, and the trial court failed to cure the error.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a codefendant’s attorney may not comment on the accused’s failure to testify, the possibility of such comment does not constitute a ground for separate trial.

Robinson v. Commonwealth, 474 S.W.2d 107, 1971 Ky. LEXIS 94 (Ky. 1971) (decision prior to 1974 amendment).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of defendant’s right to testify at her trial for lighting herself and her children on fire, resulting in the death of one of the children, was reversible error where defendant was competent to stand trial, where the right was fundamental, personal, and was not waived by her, and where she was prejudiced by the denial of that right because the trial court was forced to gag her and forcibly drag her form the courtroom in the presence of the jury because defendant was disruptive in trying to assert her right to testify. Even though the collective efforts of the trial court, prosecutors and defendant’s own attorneys was to prevent defendant from harming herself by taking the stand and attempting to commit suicide by insuring she would receive the death penalty, the trial court still had to grant defendant the right to tell her story in her own words.

Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 77 (U.S. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant requested the trial court to instruct the jury that no inference of guilt should be drawn from defendant’s failure to testify, the trial court was justified in refusing to give the instruction because the giving of the instruction would be a direct “comment” within the meaning of this section and would have emphasized the fact that the accused had not testified in his own behalf. Green v. Commonwealth, 488 S.W.2d 339, 1972 Ky. LEXIS 39 (Ky. 1972).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The former section providing that a defendant could not testify after any other defense witness, as applied to a case in which none of the other witnesses offered any testimony helpful to the defense, was not unconstitutional. Burch v. Commonwealth, 555 S.W.2d 954, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 517 (Ky. 1977) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a trial court incorrectly informed defendant that, if he testified in his rape prosecution differently from what he told his attorney during the trial with respect to the issue of force and penetration, he could be prosecuted for perjury, defendant was not deprived of his right to testify on his own behalf as the error was harmless, in that it was highly improbable under the circumstances of the case that competent defense counsel would have advised his client to testify and highly improbable that a well-advised defendant would have elected to present defendant’s testimony. Moreover, there was no claim that defendant was dissuaded from taking the stand because of the judge’s comments. Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, 339 S.W.3d 411, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 64 (Ky. 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If at a hearing the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or a grand jury investigation in the other state, and that the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending, or grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence (and of any other state through which the witness may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel), will give to him protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process, he shall issue a summons, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the summons.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> If a person in any state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within its borders to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions, or grand jury investigations commenced or about to commence, in this state, is a material witness in a prosecution pending in a court of record in this state, or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence, a judge of such court may issue a certificate under the seal of the court stating these facts and specifying the number of days the witness will be required. Said certificate may include a recommendation that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to assure his attendance in this state. This certificate shall be presented to a judge of a court of record in the county in which the witness is found.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If the witness is summoned to attend and testify in this state he shall be tendered the sum of ten cents ($0.10) a mile for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending, and five dollars ($5) for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a witness, same to be paid in manner that other witnesses are paid by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A witness who has appeared in accordance with the provisions of the summons shall not be required to remain within this state a longer period of time than the period mentioned in the certificate, unless otherwise ordered by the court. If such witness, after coming into this state, fails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, which provides for procuring prosecuting witnesses from other states but does not cover defense witnesses, involves court action and thus KRS 44.020 applies. OAG 81-336.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (2) of this section is impliedly repealed by KRS 421.015 as relates to the mileage factor. OAG 82-620.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding the ordinary level of reimbursement of travel expenses to be afforded nonresident material witnesses in felony cases, the Commonwealth must pay, as part of the necessary expenses of a witness, that amount required by the law of another state (one adopting the Uniform Witness Act) to be tendered in advance to a nonresident witness, as a prerequisite to issuance of its subpoena requiring a witness to travel to and give testimony in Kentucky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The important public policy and interest in protecting the welfare and psychological and physical well-being of children is no less compelling when the child is a witness to a crime rather than a victim, and this important public policy is sufficient to justify the absence of face-to-face confrontation with the defendant where the court determines that use of closed circuit television or video taped testimony, is necessary in a particular case; therefore, the extending of the special procedures of this section to witnesses who are 12 years of age or younger did not violate the defendant’s state or federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this section and Kentucky Acts 1996 chapter 178 (Senate Bill 169), which amended this section by extending the procedures for use of video taped and closed circuit television testimony to not only offenses involving sexual contact but also to proceedings where the child is alleged to be abused, neglected or otherwise endangered are directly related to furthering the important public policy of protecting the well-being and welfare of children; thus, use of the special procedures provided by the statute in these narrowly defined types of cases for a narrowly defined group of witnesses, is not unconstitutionally broad and does not violate the defendant’s rights to confrontation under the state and federal constitutions.

<p class="p9">A judge of the state court of record in another state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons confined in penal institutions within that state to attend and testify in this state, may certify that there is a criminal proceeding or investigation by a grand jury or a criminal action pending in the court, that a person who is confined in a penal institution in this state may be a material witness in the proceeding, investigation or action, and that his presence will be required during a specified time.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>States have substantial flexibility in deciding what procedures are needed in the context of postconviction relief, and a state may properly limit the available procedures, which will be found to violate due process only if they are fundamentally inadequate to vindicate the substantive rights provided. The procedures established in KRS 422.285 are sufficient to vindicate any substantive right to DNA testing that might also be created by the statute, as the procedures are similar to those provided for DNA evidence by federal law and the law of other States, and they are not inconsistent with the traditions and conscience of our people or with any recognized principle of fundamental fairness; as such, due process requires no additional rights beyond what is already provided in KRS 422.285 and the various postconviction procedures found in Kentucky law. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no substantive due process right to DNA testing, nor is there a procedural due process right to anything beyond what KRS 422.285 currently provides. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>1. Hearings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant could not establish that even if defendant had both anal swab slides available for DNA testing under defendant’s preferred method, that defendant would have been able to establish a reasonable probability of exculpatory evidence, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing and properly dismissed defendant’s KRS 422.285 petition. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 291 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 147 (Ky. 2009).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. DNA Testing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence must not have been previously tested for DNA or, if it was tested, the movant must show that the type of testing now being requested is qualitatively different and may resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis. KRS 422.285(2)(c) and (3)(c). By this language, the legislature made clear its intent not to have successive, redundant DNA testing requests and placed a high burden on a movant to establish that an entirely new issue is involved. Otherwise, DNA testing, sometimes many years after trial, is limited to the one bite of the apple rule. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is enough other incriminating evidence and an explanation for the DNA result, science alone cannot prove a prisoner innocent.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testing under KRS 422.285 requires that the evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing and analysis to be conducted; if the evidence does not exist, then it obviously cannot be tested, and KRS 422.285 only gives the right to a test, not to reversal of a conviction simply where testing is impossible. Thus, as a precondition to ordering testing under KRS 422.285, the trial court must also find that the evidence requested to be tested exists in a condition that will allow proper DNA testing; if it is not, then obviously the inquiry is at an end. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 91 (Ky. June 16, 2011), modified, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence to be tested for DNA must exist even though a trial court may have found reasonable probability that the evidence as described by the movant would exonerate him, lead to a more favorable verdict, or definitely be exculpatory.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in concluding that it was precluded from ordering DNA testing to be performed by an outside laboratory and in concluding that any testing ordered had to be performed by the Kentucky State Police forensic laboratory because KRS 422.285(7) authorized the circuit court to make “any other orders that the court deems appropriate.” That was a fairly broad power and clearly anticipated that the initial test done by the police laboratory might not be the end of any testing. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 91 (Ky. June 16, 2011), modified, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s finding under KRS 422.285 in support of an order for testing, that there is a reasonable probability that an appellant may have been exonerated if the results of DNA testing were favorable, is not by itself conclusive of anything. The trial court’s finding is only relevant and significant to support requiring testing. By itself, without favorable results from a DNA test, that finding is meaningless as it relates to guilt or innocence. Section 422.285 is only a mechanism for obtaining post-conviction DNA testing, which in turn might be used to show innocence or be exculpatory to a lesser degree. The statute is not itself a mechanism for speculating about innocence. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On a motion for DNA testing under KRS 422.285, a circuit court need not necessarily make separate findings for each piece of evidence to be tested. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether and when to order the collection of a sample of a KRS 422.285 petitioner’s DNA falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. So, too, does allowing the testing of a self-collected sample submitted by a petitioner’s counsel. While this latter practice may not be the best one, since it presents a greater possibility for mischief, a trial court is sufficiently cognizant of the risks of such self-collection to take steps to minimize them. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 191 (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 190 (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While KRS 17.176 anticipates that DNA testing will ordinarily be done by the Kentucky State Police Forensic Laboratory or its designee, and may even evince a preference that testing be done there, it does not impose a limit on who may test, nor does it require that testing be performed by the Kentucky State Police Forensic Laboratory or a lab of its choice in all cases. Instead, whether to order independent or outside testing falls within the sound discretion of the circuit court. The only limit on the court’s power to order outside testing is that it may do so only if it deems such testing appropriate. KRS 422.285(7). Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the circuit court erred in its determination that it did not have jurisdiction to decide appellant's motion for DNA testing under this section, the error was harmless.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was convicted of the 1990 murders of a couple and assault of their infant son, who was shot during the crimes, and he received capital sentences; he moved for DNA testing, claiming that such testing would prove that another person committed the crimes. The trial court did not err in denying his petition because the age of any DNA found could not be established sufficiently to determine when it was deposited and DNA testing at best could result in mere speculation; as the owner of the vehicle and jacket that defendant wanted to have tested, defendant’s DNA would obviously be found, and if DNA belonging to a member of the victims’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>family was also found, without being able to precisely pinpoint when the DNA was deposited, it would prove nothing. Even if another’s DNA could be found in the car or on defendant’s jacket after 16 years, that fact did not give rise to a reasonable probability of exonerating defendant, nor was there a reasonable probability that it would change the verdict or be exculpatory in any way. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 98 (Ky. Mar. 24, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the trial court’s written order omitted the phrase, “reasonable probability,” with respect to KRS 422.285(3)(a), the trial court appropriately applied that standard in denying DNA testing. Even if the hairs that defendant sought to test were not his, it would not have proven that he was never inside the car where they were found. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 381 S.W.3d 180, 2012 Ky. LEXIS 64 (Ky. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellant waived his due process claim regarding the unavailability of fingernail clippings and his inability to have them tested for DNA evidence because he did not pursue his argument to have the items tested in his appeal from the order refusing his request for DNA testing; his failure to assert his right to have the clippings analyzed foreclosed his right to make that demand later and his claim that the destruction of the clippings deprived him of due process. Garland v. Commonwealth, 458 S.W.3d 781, 2015 Ky. LEXIS 11 (Ky. 2015).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>5. Burden of Proof.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First level of proof the movant must make in support of the DNA testing request, under either KRS 422.285(2) or (3) is that the evidence sought would either exonerate the defendant, lead to a more favorable verdict or sentence, or otherwise be exculpatory. To do this, the movant must describe the role the evidence would have had if available in the original prosecution. It is obvious that at this point the movant will not know with certainty what the DNA evidence will show. Thus, KRS 422.285(2)(a) and (3)(a)(1) require the court to undertake the reasonable probability analysis under the assumption that the evidence will be favorable to the movant. This assumption does not mean that the movant gets a free pass simply because he can allege that the evidence will be helpful. He must still state what he expects the evidence to be and how that evidence would, within a reasonable probability, result in exoneration or a more favorable verdict or sentence or be exculpatory. In the exercise of sound discretion, the trial court must then make the call whether such reasonable probability exists, looking to whether such evidence would probably result in a different verdict or sentence. However, the analysis does not stop there. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both KRS 422.285(2) and (3) also require that the DNA evidence still be in existence and in such a condition that testing can be conducted. KRS 422.285(2)(b) and (3)(b). This requires the movant, at a bare minimum, to specifically identify what is to be tested, and where on the item the DNA is expected to be found, as it is patently unreasonable to expect every area of an item to be tested. Since the evidence is not in the movant’s custody, this may require the Commonwealth to establish the existence and condition of the evidence left in its or the court’s control. If the Commonwealth objects that the evidence is not testable, since the state is the custodian of the evidence, the Commonwealth must go forward with expert testimony as to the viability of testing, which the movant may rebut. Even though a trial court may have found reasonable probability that the evidence as described by the movant would exonerate him, lead to a more favorable verdict, or definitely be exculpatory, the trial court must also find that the evidence requested to be tested exists in a condition that will allow proper DNA testing. If it is not, then obviously the inquiry is at an end. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 313 (Ky. 2010).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where response from the Transportation Cabinet, Division of Driver Licensing to a request to inspect various records relating to a client’s licensing process initially required payment to a rehabilitation center for $40.00 for an “in-car driver evaluation” performed at the center, later modified to a cost of $1.00 per page for the report, the Cabinet violated the reasonable fee provision of the Open Records Act, KRS 61.874(3). The courts and the Office of the Attorney General have determined that a charge of ten cents per page is reasonable for a standard 8-1/2 inches x 11 inches paper copy. It should also be noted that under subsection (1) of this section, if the Cabinet had not retained a copy or if the requesting party had not proceeded under the Open Records Act, subsection (1) of this section may have required a release of the records without charge. 96-ORD-267.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky law does not permit commissioned officers or enlisted personnel to take acknowledgments or perform other notarial acts for spouses or other dependents of military personnel who are within the limits of Kentucky; however, commissioned officers and enlisted personnel may be appointed as notaries public by the Kentucky Secretary of State if they meet the requirements of KRS 423.010. OAG 82-591.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based upon the language of subdivision (4) of this section, commissioned officers or enlisted personnel are not permitted to take acknowledgments or perform other notarial acts for spouses or other dependents of military personnel who are within the limits of Kentucky; the federal military reservation of Fort Knox must be considered within the limits of Kentucky for at least the limited purpose of applying subdivision (4). OAG 83-136.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 228 of the Constitution requires an officer taking the oath of office to be a citizen or resident of Kentucky, and Const., § 234 requires all civil officers of Kentucky to reside in Kentucky; therefore, the provision of subdivision (6) of this section relating to the appointment of a special notary living in a foreign jurisdiction, is unconstitutional. However, under the principle of severability, as expressed in KRS 446.090, this section, minus the offending language involving appointing nonresidents, is constitutional; thus the special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under this section, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that such exercise of function does not violate the public policy of or is not in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction; the extraterritorial recognition of this section is only based upon the principles of comity. OAG 85-36.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under this section, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that such exercise of function does not violate the public policy of or is not in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction; the extraterritorial recognition of this section is only based upon the principles of comity. OAG 85-36 (modified by OAG 88-20 to the extent of conflict).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All notary publics, residents of Kentucky, including those appointed under this section, must take the oath mentioned in this section before the county judge/executive of the county in which the notary resides, and must take the oath prescribed in Const., § 228 before one of the applicable officers mentioned in KRS 62.020. OAG 85-36.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there are no substantial reasons to prohibit nonresidents from becoming notaries in this commonwealth, barring nonresidents from the ability to practice as notaries is unconstitutional. OAG 88-20 (modifying OAG 85-36 to extent of conflict).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since residency should not be considered a requirement to practice as a notary, the provision in Const., § 228 regarding state citizenship should be deleted from the oath given to a notary; furthermore, the oath may be administered in any county.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Unpublished decision:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> Based upon the plain meaning of KRS 423.130, as well as Sixth Circuit caselaw, a notary had to identify who signed the mortgage in the Certificate of Acknowledgment. Therefore the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel correctly concluded that the mortgage did not provide constructive notice under KRS 382.270 to subsequent purchasers or creditors because it was not properly acknowledged under Kentucky law and was consequently subject to avoidance by the trustee pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544, and that it should have been preserved for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 551; accordingly, the court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment to the trustee.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section and KRS 424.120, where no newspaper was published in a city and a newspaper in an adjoining city claiming to have the largest circulation in the city concerned but not in the county claimed to be qualified to accept legal advertising under KRS 424.120, such newspaper could not qualify and the qualified newspaper was that newspaper published in the entire county which had the largest bona fide circulation in that county. OAG 73-419.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of this section and KRS 424.120, a city could not legally place its required advertisement in a weekly newspaper that did not maintain its office within the corporate limits of the city even though it had the largest circulation therein. OAG 73-663.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For extensive zoning changes and map amendments, only the publication requirements of KRS Chapter 424 must be followed; individual notices need not be given all property owners. OAG 78-74.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the purpose of legal advertisements, the “publication area” for the Kenton County airport board is Kenton County, inasmuch as the operation of the Kenton County airport, though conducted in the main in Boone County, is an official activity of the airport board, which was created by Kenton County and which is derivatively a board of Kenton County. OAG 80-584.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter applies only to those publications required by law to be published. However, an exception under this act is the list of uncollectible delinquent taxes, which must be published pursuant to KRS 424.330. OAG 82-128.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the home rule authority it is possible that a city could, pursuant to appropriate ordinance, require the publication of the names of those persons who are delinquent in paying their sewer and water bills. However, the power to do so would remain questionable pending litigation. OAG 82-128.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Publication pursuant to KRS Chapter 424,” as provided by KRS 426.560 means (1) publication in a particular “publication area” and (2) publication in a qualified newspaper. OAG 94-9.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the language of subsection (1) of this section, the “publication area” within which an advertisement is required by law to be made by a master commissioner, is the particular county in which circuit court a master commissioner serves, is located.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The circulation of a newspaper, as reflected in the “statement of ownership,” is not controlling in determining the “bona fide paid circulation” in the publication area; therefore, a fiscal court, in a county with two (2) or more newspapers that meet the requirements of KRS 424.120, must solicit affidavits from otherwise qualified newspapers as to their “bona fide paid circulation” within the publication area, in order to determine which newspaper is entitled to receive statutorily required advertising of governmental notices.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> It shall be published in the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be published in the area if it maintains its principal office in the area for the purpose of gathering news and soliciting advertisements and other general business of newspaper publications, and has a periodicals class mailing permit issued for that office. A newspaper published outside of Kentucky shall not be eligible to carry advertisements for any county or publication area within the county, other than for the city in which its main office is located, if there is a newspaper published in the county that has a substantial general circulation throughout the county and that otherwise meets the requirements of this section; and</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> It shall be of regular issue and have a bona fide circulation in the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be of regular issue if it is published at least once a week, for at least fifty (50) weeks during the calendar year as prescribed by its mailing permit, and has been so published in the area for the immediately preceding two (2) year period. A newspaper meeting all the criteria to be of regular issue, except publication in the area for the immediately preceding two (2) year period, shall be deemed to be of regular issue if it is the only paper in the publication area and has a paid circulation equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the population of the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be of bona fide circulation in the publication area if it is circulated generally in the area, and maintains a definite price or consideration not less than fifty percent (50%) of its published price, and is paid for by not less than fifty percent (50%) of those to whom distribution is made; and</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> It shall bear a title or name, consist of not less than four (4) pages without a cover, and be of a type to which the general public resorts for passing events of a political, religious, commercial, and social nature, and for current happenings, announcements, miscellaneous reading matter, advertisements, and other notices. The news content shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total column space in more than one-half (1/2) of its issues during any twelve (12) month period.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> If, in a publication area there is more than one (1) newspaper which meets the above requirements, the newspaper having the largest bona fide paid circulation as shown by the average number of paid copies of each issue as shown in its published statement of ownership as filed on October 1 for the publication area shall be the newspaper where advertisements required by law to be published shall be carried.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> For the purposes of KRS Chapter 424, publishing shall be considered as the total recurring processes of producing the newspaper, embracing all of the included contents of reading matter, illustrations, and advertising enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection. A newspaper shall not be excluded from qualifying for the purposes of legal publications as provided in this chapter if its printing or reproduction processes take place outside the publication area.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2) (a)</b> If, in the case of a publication area smaller than the county in which it is located, there is no newspaper published in the area, the publication shall be made in a newspaper published in the county that is qualified under this section to publish advertisements for the county. If the qualified newspaper publishes a zoned edition which is distributed to regular subscribers within the publication area, any advertisement required by law to be published in the publication area may be published in the zoned edition distributed in that area.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> If, in any county there is no newspaper meeting the requirements of this section for publishing advertisements for that county, any advertisements required to be published for the county or for any publication area within the county shall be published in a newspaper of the largest bona fide circulation in that county published in and qualified to publish advertisements for an adjoining county in Kentucky. This subsection is intended to supersede any statute that provides or contemplates that newspaper publication may be dispensed with if there is no newspaper printed or published or of general circulation in the particular publication area.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If a publication area consists of a district, other than a city, which extends into more than one (1) county, the part of the district in each county shall be considered to be a separate publication area for the purposes of this section, and an advertisement for each separate publication area shall be published in a newspaper qualified under this section to publish advertisements for the area.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is more than one newspaper qualifying under this section to run mandated county advertising, then the newspaper with the largest bona fide circulation should get the county’s advertising; in speaking of the largest bona fide circulation, it is the circulation shown by the published statement of ownership for the publication area. However, where two county newspapers each claim that it has the largest circulation, the fiscal court in making the determination of which newspaper actually does have the highest bona fide circulation in the county may use any reasonable means to elicit evidence necessary to make such determination.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the annual performance report required by KRS 158.690 (repealed) to be published is a matter required by law to be published, it is an “advertisement” within the meaning of KRS Chapter 424, and this section is applicable to the school district’s duty to publish the annual performance report pursuant to KRS 158.690 (repealed).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The publication of the entire notice of annexation statute (KRS 81A.420) does not reasonably inform the general public of the time frame for protesting an annexation proposal; in preference to giving the public notice by publishing KRS 81A.420 in its entirety, a simple “notice” publication conforming to KRS 424.130(1)(b) and this section, informing the interested public of their right to protest would have been sufficient and not reasonably susceptible to misinterpretation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorneys of Kentucky are not required to publish a financial statement pursuant to this section since the auditing of the county attorney’s books pursuant to KRS 43.070 and KRS 64.810 is ample to disclose the specifics of his official operation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts 1982, ch. 430, which amends several statutes relating to publication requirements of cities, including KRS 91A.040 and this section, is basically an amendment of the municipal publication requirements and does not affect the city budget process, financial matters in cities or matters relating to the administration of city finances. It gives a city a choice as to which of two devices relating to finances and expenditures must be published annually rather than requiring that they both be published and affects what a city publishes after the completion of the fiscal year, but does not affect the activities of a city during the fiscal year; it does not impair any vested rights.

OAG 82-631.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section conflicts with KRS 91A.040 and 91A.041 (repealed) in that it requires the publication of the financial statement within 60 days after the close of the fiscal year; since KRS 91A.040(8) is more specific in nature, in that it applies solely to cities, and since it is new legislation, it would prevail in its time requirement which is tied in with the 270-day time leeway permitted in KRS 91A.040(1) with regard to the preparation of the city’s audit.

Thus, it would not apply to a district health department which received its funding from state, federal, county, and public health taxing district sources, and imposed no taxes or charges upon the public.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 65.070, relating to publication of financial statements, has no application to a district health department; however, the financial statement provisions of this section do apply to a district health department.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county metropolitan sewer district may, whether operating under this section, the bidding statute, or KRS 45A.345, the model procurement code, adopt a “Buy American” clause, which requires a contractor or supplier to furnish only goods manufactured in America, as a standard procurement policy, included in all purchasing contracts and bid specifications. OAG 81-34.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court of a county may lease a portion of the tobacco base owned by the county to individuals, since the power of the court under KRS 67.080 to sell real property includes the power to lease, and the lease of county property does not come under the competitive bidding requirements of this section and the Model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A, since the bidding principle applies only to governmental acquisitions, not situations where the government is the lessor; however, the lease must contain the precise consideration given, since the fiscal court must make full public disclosure of its transactions. OAG 81-107.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a fiscal court has specifically adopted the Kentucky Model Procurement Code, pursuant to KRS 45A.350 (repealed), it must, under subdivision (23) of KRS 45A.345, purchase insurance under a competitive bidding system, even though this section excepts professional services such as insurance from competitive bidding. OAG 81-109.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county fiscal court, in a county which has not adopted the Kentucky Model Procurement Code under KRS 45A.350 (repealed), may participate in a self-insuring workers’ compensation trust in connection with a workers’ compensation benefits program for hospital workers without letting out the insurance contracts under a competitive bidding procedure, since failure to adopt the procurement code leaves the fiscal court free under this section to let the contract without bidding. OAG 81-117.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assuming that a county fiscal court has not adopted KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460 of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code, then this section applies to the purchase of its gasoline, petroleum, and other supplies used by the county road department. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statutory requirement of advertisement for bids is “jurisdictional,” and a fiscal court is without power to enter into a contract without such advertisement, where the purchase requires bidding. Further, a party deals with a public agency at its peril if it contracts with an agency and fails to inquire into the power of the agency to execute such contract. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Number of months’ supply of any needed commodity which must be considered for bidding purposes is, because of its nature, a matter that must be left to the sound administrative discretion of the fiscal court. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The matter of letting out for bids the gasoline and oil needed for the county road department is left to the good business judgment of the fiscal court in terms of the period of consumption, price fluctuations, availability of the commodity for a definite period, etc. However, a fiscal court should not deliberately buy the needed commodities in “dribbles and dabs” merely to circumvent advertised bidding. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The three important benefits of the bidding process are: (a) an offering to the public, (b) an opportunity for competition and (c) a basis for an exact comparison of bids. OAG 82-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no conflict between this section and the model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A, concerning the necessity of school boards taking competitive bids for general liability insurance since local school districts, as local public agencies, have a choice whether to operate with respect to their procurement needs under either the local Model Procurement Code or this section. OAG 82-170.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require general liability insurance for school districts to be competitively bid. OAG 82-170.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The emergency clause of Acts 1982, ch. 282, which amended this section among others, related solely to § 3 of the act which amended KRS 45A.335 to exclude members of state boards and commissions from the term “officer or employe,” as used in the conflict of interest statute, KRS 45A.340(5); it not only did not relate to the other sections of the bill, which were separable, but it gave no reason to justify that an emergency existed with respect to these sections. In view of the fact that the Ky. Const., § 55 requires an act to express in plain language what the emergency is in order for it to be effective only § 3 became effective on April 2, 1982, upon the passage of the act and approval of the governor, and the remaining sections of the act became effective as ordinary legislation on July 15, 1982. OAG 82-308.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court, governed by this section (that is, any fiscal court not adopting KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460), may effect purchases up to $7,500 without formal bidding procedure. OAG 82-324.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any fiscal court adopting KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460 may, under KRS 45A.385, effect purchases not exceeding $5,000 without formal bidding procedures, while those fiscal courts, under current law, which have not adopted such sections, are governed by this section. OAG 82-324.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although site work can be, and is usually interpreted to be, a part of a project involving school building construction or remodeling, site work unrelated to school building construction does not come within the scope of KRS 162.070. Thus, where a school district wished to correct a drainage problem at one of its schools, this section and the $7,500 “small purchases” ceiling was applicable to the contract for drainage site work. OAG 82-407.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that KRS 162.070 and this section are in conflict, the provisions and therefore the $7,500 amount found in this section, as amended in 1982, must be deemed to prevail over the lower $5,000 amount remaining in KRS 162.070. OAG 82-407.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section, a cafeteria plan of insurance coverage for school teachers need not be bid; under the Model Procurement Code if a contract is for group life insurance, group health and accident insurance, group professional liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and unemployment insurance, the contract may be noncompetitively negotiated. OAG 83-151.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section has no application to a county sheriff. OAG 83-249.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fiscal court resolution requiring that tiles and tires be purchased from the cheapest places in the county is in restrictive conflict with this section and KRS 45A.365(5) and is invalid. OAG 83-258.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the reconstructing or paving of separate county road segments could involve unified specifications and work performance of such nature that bids on the total number of projects as a total package could be obtained, the total work should be let under advertisement for bids, pursuant to this section or KRS Chapter 45A, whichever is applicable to the county; however, if the fiscal court determines upon investigation that lump sum bids upon the total projects cannot be obtained from the road construction trade, then the various road segments should be treated as legally and factually separate and bidding would be necessary for any of the projects if they exceed for a single project the sum of $5,000 (if the Model Procurement Code applies in the county) or exceeds $7,500 (if this section applies in the county). OAG 83-316.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No county fee officer can engage in a bidding contract of purchase of supplies or equipment, i.e., binding on the county where the money for the purchase is to come directly out of the county treasury; the fiscal court is the authority in contracting for county supplies or equipment, payable out of the county treasury. OAG 83-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Should a fee officer have to purchase items of equipment or personal property that are not consumable but will have a reasonable life span, such as motor vehicles, the title would be taken in the name of the county and the purchases would be subject to the county’s handling of the purchases and applicable provisions relating to bidding law under this section or KRS Chapter 45A (where the fiscal court has adopted the provisions of KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460). Where the county clerk or sheriff has adopted KRS 45A.345 through 45A.460, such officer could handle the purchase under the applicable bidding law in KRS Chapter 45A, but only with the approval of the fiscal court; and the title to the nonconsumable property or property of any reasonable life span would be in the name of the county. OAG 83-448.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 42.355(4) (now subsection (2)), in mentioning the bidding law of this chapter, specifically adopts this section to the extent that this section requires formal bidding. OAG 84-57.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A unit of government, in connection with the demands of a bidding statute, cannot divide the work and let it under several contracts so as to circumvent the bidding requirement, thus where the transactions are not legally and factually severable, they cannot be manipulated to circumvent the declared bidding policy of this section. OAG 84-57.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though a riverport authority is created jointly by a city and county, the created authority is still a body politic and corporate, it is still a special district and, thus, the district, i.e., the riverport authority, is subject to the bidding principle under this section, or the Model Procurement Code if adopted by the authority. OAG 84-196.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bidding statute, this section, applies to a riverport authority created pursuant to KRS 65.510 et seq., unless the authority has specifically adopted the Model Procurement Code (KRS 45A.345 to 45A.460), in which latter case the Model Procurement Code, with its bidding requirements, applies to the riverport authority. OAG 84-196.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A city’s expenditure of $10,000 for the services of a professional engineer to survey and engineer a sewer line installation project falls within the category of professional services exempt from bidding under the terms of this section. OAG 84-274.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a riverport authority, created pursuant to KRS 65.510 et seq., has chosen to not adopt provisions of the Model Procurement Code under KRS 45A.343, such riverport authority automatically comes under the mandatory terms of the bidding statute, this section. OAG 84-297 (modifying OAG 80-71).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If reasonably detailed specifications describing the scope of a project are first prepared, such that competing potential bidders can know with particularity the product for which a bid might be tendered, and bids are solicited in relation to those specifications in conformity with KRS 424.130, and 424.140, the design/build approach to construction procurement might be utilized by a county. OAG 92-143.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the construction inspector hired by the board of education is merely inspecting the building constructed by the general contractor and reporting back to the board, and the contract specifically releases the construction inspector from any responsibility for the actual construction of the school, these activities did not constitute professional services. The construction inspector lacked the necessary decision-making responsibility. Since the construction inspector was not considered to be supplying professional services, he was not exempt from the bidding requirements of this section. OAG 92-144.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where self-insured groups of Kentucky Association of Counties contracted with third party administrators to provide professional services involving the use of training, discretion, and judgment in the field of insurance, such professional services contracts may be entered into without any type of open bid. OAG 94-1.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where bid invitation contained no indication of either the quantity of materials to be purchased nor the projects for which the materials would be used, the bid invitation did not grant reasonable notice of county’s intentions and did not comply with the statute. OAG 94-20.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Documents tendered as part of competitive sealed bidding become open public records at the time the bids are opened, even if the bids are rejected. Public disclosure of bid documents associated with a competitive sealed bid can not be delayed until the contracting public agency determined whether to move to competitive negotiation, and if a determination is made to proceed into competitive negotiation, the original bid documents can not be considered part of the negotiation process and remain closed until a contract is awarded or negotiations are cancelled. OAG 05-ORD-001.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A local public agency that has not adopted the Model Procurement Code is not required to follow competitive bidding procedures for insurance, and may contract with an insurance broker to solicit and receive bids for insurance, although competitive bidding remains preferred. A local public agency that has adopted the Model Procurement Code must follow all applicable provisions in seeking contracts with insurance brokers. OAG 13-006.</p>

It gives a city a choice as to which of two devices relating to finances and expenditures must be published annually rather than requiring that they both be published and affects what a city publishes after the completion of the fiscal year, but does not affect the activities of a city during the fiscal year; it does not impair any vested rights.
