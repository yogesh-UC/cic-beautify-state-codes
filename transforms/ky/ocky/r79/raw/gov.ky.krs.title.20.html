<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “qualified voter” as used in this section means a voter who is constitutionally qualified and properly registered, so that a person who signs a local option petition must be 18 years of age, a resident of the state for one year, of the county for six months, and of the precinct for 60 days as prescribed by Ky Const., § 145, and be a duly registered voter, but need not have voted in the last election. OAG 66-190.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While under subsection (1) of this section, a petition may consist of one or more separate units, each unit should clearly indicate that it is part of a single petition calling for a local option election on a certain date. OAG 66-190.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a county-wide local option election, cities of the first four classes vote separately and are not controlled by the vote in the rest of the county. OAG 66-309.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once an entire county has voted dry, no smaller unit of that county can hold a separate election for voting wet except for cities of the first four classes. Accordingly, a county court should not order a local option election to be held in a county that has voted dry even though the petition filed with the court meets all the requirements of this section. OAG 70-500.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the addresses following the names on a petition are not specific, such signatures should be counted in determining the number of valid signatures unless the names are challenged. OAG 73-64.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a petition for the holding of a local option election has been filed with the county court clerk, the petition containing the signatures of the petitioners becomes a record of the county clerk and the petition signer no longer possesses the right to enjoin or prohibit the use of his name without his consent, so that a citizen or a group of citizens could obtain all of the names on a local option petition calling for an election on the sale of alcoholic beverages and publish the names of the signers without the consent of the signers.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the boundaries of a precinct are changed in order to decrease the number of registered voters to the legal maximum of 700 as provided by KRS 127.050 (repealed), a local option election can be validly called in the new precinct only upon a petition of qualified voters of the new precinct equal to 25 percent of the votes cast by the voters in the new precinct at the last preceding general election. OAG 73-300.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no time limit as to when a petition must be filed after the first petitioner signs the petition, but all signers of the petitions for local option elections must be registered voters so that the signature of anyone who has moved out of the territory or who has died prior to the filing date of the local option election petition cannot be considered the signature of a “constitutionally qualified voter.” OAG 73-707.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A local option election may not be held for an annexed portion of a city where the portion is less than a whole precinct as the smallest division encompassed by the term “territory” is a precinct. OAG 74-451.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, subsequent to local option election in city in which city voted “wet,” territory was annexed to city, application for a malt beverage license should have been denied since the annexed territory encompassing the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was being sought remained “dry” after becoming annexed to the city and an election would have to be held in the entire precinct encompassing the annexed territory and therefore in the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was sought in order to redetermine the local option status of the annexed territory, including the business location in question.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The holding of a city-wide election which produces a vote against prohibition does not prevent a local option election from thereafter being held in any precinct of the city. OAG 79-382.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The smallest area considered and defined as a territory is a precinct and no smaller political unit or area of a city or county can hold a local option election. OAG 79-382.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where three commercial liquor establishments located in a county precinct about to have a local option election were annexed by a “wet” city the day before the election, they were no longer a part of that precinct and would be unaffected by the outcome of the election.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A voter who signs a petition for a local option election must indicate his address opposite his name for identification purposes that can either be his exact residence or a post office address, since such designation has been held to be directory rather than mandatory and the clerk may exercise his own discretion as to whether the designation is sufficient in order to identify the petitioner as a qualified voter. OAG 80-431.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for a local option election is a public record and may be inspected by any person and the petition may be published in a newspaper or in any other manner, including the names of the persons who signed the petition; unless a person purported to have signed a petition has had the court declare that his name was placed on the petition without the person’s authority and should therefore be removed, the person has no legal recourse if his name is made public as a signer of the petition and there is no liability for the disclosure of the petition and the names thereon. OAG 80-450.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a local option election is confined to the corporate limits of the city, only those qualified voters residing within the city are entitled to sign the petition or to vote in the election; the clerk, in sending out the registration lists to the split precincts, should indicate which voters live within or without the city so that the election officers can lockout the local option election for those voters who may appear but who are not entitled to vote in the city election by virtue of being nonresidents. OAG 80-466.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a local option petition is filed, it is the responsibility of the clerk, on behalf of the county judge/executive who calls the election, to check the petition to see if the correct percentage of the qualified voters have signed as required by this section; following the filing of the petition it can be challenged in court by any qualified voter in opposition to the election.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the county judge/executive who is responsible for examining the petition for a local option election on its face to determine whether the petition is correctly filed under the express terms of this section, but the county judge/executive can call on the clerk to assist him in comparing the petition with the voters’ registration data on file in the clerk’s office; where the county judge/executive has good reason to believe that a particular signature is not genuine, he may ask the person with that name to voluntarily come to the county judge/executive’s office to give evidence about it, one way or the other, and if it appears to the county judge/executive, after such evidence, that someone other than the so-called petitioner signed his name without authority, the county judge/executive may eliminate such name by an order in his executive order book, and such signature will not be counted as a petitioner. OAG 80-495; 82-538.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So long as it appears a signer is a constitutionally qualified voter in the county and that he signed his own name, a misstatement as to his residence would not be a basis for the county judge/executive’s ordering the elimination of that name from the local option election petition.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county clerk cannot be held liable in a civil suit for making a petition for a local option election available to the public for inspection or having a copy made since, by law, it becomes a public record when it is filed subject to both inspection and copying; the mere fact that the petition is subsequently declared invalid for insufficient compliance with the statute would have no bearing on the clerk’s civil liability. OAG 83-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once a petition for a local option election is filed and duly recorded, it becomes a public record irrespective of whether or not it is found to meet the statutory requirements for validity and cannot be withdrawn.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a petition could be valid despite the omission of Social Security numbers, it necessarily follows that an irregularity in the inclusion of the numbers, such as using voter’s files from the clerk’s office to add the numbers to the signed petition, would not necessarily invalidate the petition. OAG 91-174.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The complete omission of a Social Security number or date of birth would not necessarily invalidate a petition, as long as the county judge/executive can make the required determination of whether a sufficient number of voters request the election.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The petition must state the petitioner’s address, and the date on which he signed, and either the petitioner’s Social Security number or date of birth. OAG 91-174.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the date may be omitted entirely without disqualification of the voter’s signature, it follows that a mere alteration to the date does not necessarily disqualify the petition or the signature. OAG 91-204.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The petition is filed with the clerk, since the clerk is the official custodian of such records, and the clerk then delivers the petition to the county judge/executive. OAG 92-132.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The petitioner must state his social security number or date of birth. If this information is given, the clerk should be able to determine the identity of the person signing even though the actual signature may be illegible. Therefore an illegible signature should be disallowed only if the clerk or the county judge/executive is unable to determine the petitioner’s identity after consulting the other information given on the petition. OAG 92-132.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of the local option statute requiring petitioners to state their address and date of signing were “directory” rather than mandatory, and therefore the names of petitioners should be counted even if they omitted the address or date entirely. OAG 92-132.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, in conjunction with the general law on petitions, requires that a petitioner be a qualified voter both at the time the petition is signed and at the time it is filed. OAG 92-132.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any messenger or delivery service used to acquire alcoholic beverages to be transported into dry territory would be in direct violation of this section, regardless of whose money was used to purchase the beverages and regardless of ownership.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the conducting of gambling activity on licensed premises, if not found to be advancing or profiting from such activity, would not subject a licensee to criminal liability under the penal code, the ABC Board has authority to revoke or suspend an individual’s license for permitting such activity on licensed premises.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The penalties provided for in KRS 243.990 (1) may only be additionally imposed on an offender whose license has been actually revoked, for if the offender’s license is only temporarily suspended the sanctions are not applicable.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute forbids a licensee to “procure or permit” a third party on the licensed premises to sell, give or deliver alcoholic beverages to a minor, regardless of where the beverages were obtained. OAG 64-281.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A licensee permits alcoholic beverages “to be sold, given away or delivered” when he has actual knowledge that such is being or will be done or when the circumstances are such that as a reasonably prudent man he should have had such knowledge.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That portion of a city ordinance which imposed a lesser punishment for the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors than the state statute on the same subject was unconstitutional. OAG 67-273.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section appears to be directed more toward retail businesses, while KRS 530.070 appears to be directed toward private persons acting in their private capacities. OAG 91-51.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee of a retail licensee sells alcoholic beverages to a minor the retail licensee is held to a strict liability standard for the direct illegal acts of his employee. Although the offense might be directly committed by the employee, the retail business is held accountable.

A licensed common carrier shall not knowingly ship unlicensed alcoholic beverage shipments into the Commonwealth. Deliveries or shipments of alcoholic beverages shall only be made into areas of the state in which alcoholic beverages may be lawfully sold. When the shipper requests adult-signature-only service, it shall be a violation for a common carrier not to inspect government-issued identification for proof of age.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether the vertical restraint created by this section violates the antitrust laws would depend on whether the restraint poses a significant injury to competition and the anti-competitive conduct clearly overrides any procompetitive redeeming benefit. OAG 82-514.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting this section, the 1982 General Assembly clearly articulated its policy to supplant the free and open market determination of distributor arrangements by requiring a written agreement between the distributor and brewer or supplier which defines the distributor’s exclusive territory; however, the section fails to provide for adequate state supervision over this policy since the determination of the exclusive territories is accomplished by private parties rather than by the state and the state does not regulate or “police” the enforcement of these exclusive territorial arrangements entered into by private parties. Thus, even though the exclusive territories for distributors are required by this section, the arrangements are not immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine; whether the conduct contemplated by the section violates the antitrust laws would depend upon the factual circumstances surrounding the particular arrangement and the existence of an illegal restraint of trade. OAG 82-514.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section represents a vertical restraint between the brewer or supplier and the distributor by confining the distributor to a particular area of operation (plus various other restrictions relating to sale and quality control); these vertical nonprice restraints contained the potential to promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of his products and, moreover, society’s increasing demand that manufacturers directly assume responsibility for the safety and quality of their products constitutes a legitimate reason or justification for manufacturer control over the manner in which his product is sold. Accordingly, there is a rational relationship, for equal protection purposes, between the classification and the objectives justifying it; the statute also withstands a due process analysis in that it bears a reasonable relationship to the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages. OAG 82-514.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to effectuate the intent of this section and to construe subsection (3) of this section in harmony with the other subsections, the phrase “brewer and supplier” in the last sentence of subsection (3) must be interpreted as “brewer or supplier” and thus subsection (3) must be interpreted to require the prior written approval of the supplier or brewer for the sale of a particular brand of malt beverage.
