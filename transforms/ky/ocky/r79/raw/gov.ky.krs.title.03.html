Acts ch. 92 was passed last by the General Assembly and, ordinarily, any provisions in ch. 92 which conflict with provisions in ch. 89, the earlier-passed bill, would prevail under the authority of KRS 446.250. However, new language added in ch. 92 has not been incorporated into KRS 11.200 because to make such change would make the section unintelligible. KRS 7.136(3) provides that if a statute is amended by more than one act in the same session of the General Assembly, that the change shall be given effect and incorporated only if the change will make the section intelligible.</p>

<p class="p9">The General Assembly declares it to be the purpose of KRS 11.210 to 11.260 to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a governor and the inauguration of a new governor. The interest of the Commonwealth requires that such transitions be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the Commonwealth and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in KRS 11.210 to 11.260 directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all officers of the state government so conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as to be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of Governor, to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power and otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of Governor.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> It is the public policy of this Commonwealth that a public servant shall work for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the Governor is defined as a department of state government, he is covered under the terms of KRS 61.092 to 61.096 (see now KRS 45A.330 to 45A.340). OAG 60-242.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Lieutenant Governor, by virtue of his membership on the Legislative Research Commission, is included under KRS 61.092 to 61.096 (see now KRS 45A.330 to 45A.340). OAG 60-242.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The officers and employees of the Governor’s department would be included under the terms of KRS 61.092 to 61.096 (see now KRS 45A.330 to 45A.340). OAG 60-242.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State agencies may make payment to the state auditor of the costs of the annual audit or other necessary audit and the auditor may receive such payments, reimbursements and/or inter-accounting to cover the costs of such proper services.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Heritage Commission is a separate administrative body of state government with both policy making and advisory roles in carrying out its duties and functions under KRS 171.381 and should coordinate with other departments which may be expending funds on conservation, archaeological, economic, historic landmarks and other matters related to the commission’s functions and projects and also is advisory to the Governor on executive actions, legislative matters and in passing on the budget of the commission and on the budgets of other departments upon which the commission’s advice might be sought. OAG 75-80.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Governor may under KRS 12.025 (repealed) reorganize by executive order the Department of Agriculture, which is administered by a constitutional officer, until the General Assembly reconvenes since the Department of Agriculture is clearly a department for Chapter 12 purposes under this section, since the General Assembly has not specifically exempted a department headed by an elected official from the KRS 12.025 (repealed) reorganization powers of the Governor, as was done with certain other departments, and since the Governor in the absence of the General Assembly can prescribe through executive order the duties and responsibilities of the Commissioner of Agriculture under Ky. Const., § 91 and Ky. Const., § 93; however, the Governor cannot strip a constitutional officer of all duties under KRS 12.025 (repealed) and leave an empty shell for him to administer since the General Assembly could not do this while it was in session. OAG 81-3.</p>

The subject matter of each executive order relating to reorganization shall be presented to the General Assembly in a separate bill. If the General Assembly fails to enact the temporary reorganization plan or an alternative to such plan, the organizational structure that existed immediately prior to the implementation of the temporary plan shall be reinstated upon the termination of the temporary plan. If the General Assembly fails to enact a temporary reorganization plan, the Governor, the Kentucky Economic Development Partnership as created in KRS 154.10-010, and other elected state executive officers shall not effect the plan prior to the next succeeding session of the General Assembly.</p>

Const., §§ 27, 28 and also 36; and, even if an attempt were made to establish the Legislative Research Commission as an executive agency, the General Assembly is prohibited by Ky.

OAG 63-140.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If counsel to represent the Commissioner of Fish and Wildlife Resources before the Personnel Board is employed pursuant to KRS 12.210, and not supplied by the Attorney General, he will be paid from the funds of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee of the Department of Child Welfare (now Cabinet for Health and Family Services) is involved in criminal charges brought as the result of events which occurred while he was carrying out duties for the Department, the Attorney General could not represent the employee in a criminal defense but the Department’s attorney or special counsel, if such appointment is first approved by the Governor or a prior appointment of special counsel is ratified by the Governor, could do so; but in a civil matter the Attorney General, a departmental attorney, or special counsel may represent him if it is determined in the best interest of the Commonwealth. OAG 73-512.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the duty of the Attorney General to represent state officers or departments in litigation in which the Commonwealth has an interest but it does not give a state officer or employee an enforceable right to representation when he is sued individually unless the Attorney General or the legal counsel of the department believes the state has an interest in the litigation. OAG 73-874.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The contract for the defense of an employee of the state fire marshal’s office was between the Department of Insurance and the attorney and was entered into under the authority of this section with the approval of the Governor and was therefore legal at its inception and could legally be renewed until the purpose of the contract was accomplished; the fact that the Attorney General decided under KRS 12.211 not to undertake the defense was immaterial as to the validity of the contract.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State university personal service contracts for legal services are subject to the provisions of this section; before consideration for approval of the contract by the Governor, the contract must be presented to the Attorney General for review, and the term of the contract may not exceed the biennium period in which it is executed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An arrangement made by a fiscal court with attorneys, pursuant to KRS 134.370 (now repealed), for the collection of taxes, does not make it a contract of employment by the state, even though the secretary of revenue approves the employment as relates to state taxes; thus such county contracts of employment would in no way violate the letter or spirit of KRS 45.717 (now repealed) and subsection (1) of this section.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> When promulgating administrative regulations and reviewing existing ones, administrative bodies shall, whenever possible, tier their administrative regulations to reduce disproportionate impacts on certain classes of regulated entities, including government or small business, or both, and to avoid regulating entities that do not contribute significantly to the problem the administrative regulation was designed to address.

The SEAP merely reviews the actions of the LEAP to determine compliance with an approved evaluation plan and thereby provide accountability and encouragement for local districts to implement appropriate evaluation plans. The SEAP is not empowered to reinstate a teacher to a prior position or provide any other remedy apart from setting aside a defective evaluation. Therefore, the SEAP does not conduct administrative hearings and actions of the SEAP do not come within the purview of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 13B. Geron v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ., 2018 Ky.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> A hearing officer shall preside over the conduct of an administrative hearing and shall regulate the course of the proceedings in a manner which will promote the orderly and prompt conduct of the hearing. When a prehearing order has been issued, the hearing officer shall regulate the hearing in conformity with the prehearing order.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The hearing officer, at appropriate stages of the proceedings, shall give all parties full opportunity to file pleadings, motions, objections, and offers of settlement. The hearing officer, at appropriate stages of the proceedings, may give all parties full opportunity to file briefs, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and proposed recommended or final orders. The original of all filings shall be mailed to the agency, and copies of any filed item shall be served on all parties and the hearing officer by mail or any other means permitted by law or prescribed by agency administrative regulation. The agency shall when it is received stamp the time and date upon a document.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The hearing officer may issue subpoenas and discovery orders when requested by a party or on his own volition. When a subpoena is disobeyed, any party may apply to the Circuit Court of the judicial circuit in which the administrative hearing is held for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with an order of the court shall be cause for punishment as a contempt of the court.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> To the extent necessary for the full disclosure of all relevant facts and issues, the hearing officer shall afford all parties the opportunity to respond, present evidence and argument, conduct cross-examination, and submit rebuttal evidence, except as restricted by limited grant of intervention or a prehearing order.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Any party to an administrative hearing may participate in person or be represented by counsel. In informal proceedings, a party may be represented by other professionals if appropriate and if permitted by the agency by administrative regulation.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If a party properly served under KRS 13B.050 fails to attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of the administrative hearing process, or fails to comply with the orders of a hearing officer, the hearing officer may adjourn the proceedings and issue a default order granting or denying relief as appropriate, or may conduct the proceedings without the participation of the defaulting party, having due regard for the interests of justice and the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings. A default order shall be considered a recommended order and shall be processed as provided in KRS 13B.110.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> A hearing officer may conduct all or part of an administrative hearing, or a prehearing conference, by telephone, television, or other electronic means, if each party to the hearing has an opportunity to hear, and, if technically feasible, to see the entire proceeding as it occurs, and if each party agrees.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> An administrative hearing shall be open to the public unless specifically closed pursuant to a provision of law. If an administrative hearing is conducted by telephone, television, or other electronic means, and is not closed, public access shall be satisfied by giving the public an opportunity, at reasonable times, to hear or inspect the agency’s record.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> In an administrative hearing, findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence on the record. The hearing officer shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts of this Commonwealth. Hearsay evidence may be admissible, if it is the type of evidence that reasonable and prudent persons would rely on in their daily affairs, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support an agency’s findings of facts unless it would be admissible over objections in civil actions.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form if doing so will expedite the hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any party. The hearing officer may make a recommended order in an administrative hearing submitted in written form if the hearing officer determines there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Any party shall have the right to inspect, at least five (5) days prior to the hearing, a list of all witnesses every other party expects to call at the hearing, and the available documentary or tangible evidence relating to an administrative hearing either in person or by counsel. Copies of documentary evidence may be obtained upon the payment of a fee, except documents protected from disclosure by state or federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as giving a party the right to examine or copy the personal notes, observations, or conclusions of the agency staff, unless exculpatory in nature, nor shall it be construed as allowing access to the work product of counsel for the agency. Conditions for examining and copying agency records, fees to be charged, and other matters pertaining to access to these records shall be governed by KRS 61.870 to 61.884. To the extent required by due process, the hearing officer may order the inspection of any records excluded from the application of KRS 61.870 to 61.884 under KRS 61.878 that relate to an act, transaction, or event that is a subject of the hearing, and may order their inclusion in the record under seal.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Objections to evidentiary offers may be made by any party and shall be noted in the record.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The hearing officer may take official notice of facts which are not in dispute, or of generally-recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency’s specialized knowledge. The hearing officer shall notify all parties, either before or during the hearing, or in preliminary reports or otherwise, of any facts so noticed and their source. All parties shall be given an opportunity to contest facts officially noticed.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> The agency shall cause all testimony, motions, and objections in a hearing to be accurately and completely recorded. Any person, upon request, may receive a copy of the recording or a copy of the transcript, if the hearing has been transcribed, at the discretion of the agency, unless the hearing is closed by law. The agency may prepare a transcript of a hearing or a portion of a hearing upon request but the party making the request shall be responsible for the transcription costs. The form of all requests and fees charged shall be consistent with KRS 61.870 to 61.884.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> In all administrative hearings, unless otherwise provided by statute or federal law, the party proposing the agency take action or grant a benefit has the burden to show the propriety of the agency action or entitlement to the benefit sought. The agency has the burden to show the propriety of a penalty imposed or the removal of a benefit previously granted. The party asserting an affirmative defense has the burden to establish that defense. The party with the burden of proof on any issue has the burden of going forward and the ultimate burden of persuasion as to that issue. The ultimate burden of persuasion in all administrative hearings is met by a preponderance of evidence in the record, except when a higher standard of proof is required by law. Failure to meet the burden of proof is grounds for a recommended order from the hearing officer.</p>

When any attorney is employed for any said agency, the same shall have the approval of such agency before such employment. If any funds of any kind or nature whatsoever are recovered by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, in any action, including an ex rel. action where the Attorney General has entered an appearance or is a party according to statutory or common law authority, those funds shall be handled under KRS 48.005.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In reading KRS 15.200 and KRS 15.020 with consistency, the Kentucky Court of Appeals believes that, when the General Assembly enacted KRS 15.020, the Kentucky Attorney General did not have the common law power to investigate and prosecute cases at will, nor was the enactment of KRS 15.020 a grant of such a power; however, the subsequent enactment of KRS 15.200 is a specific grant of authority to the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute cases in limited circumstances. Accordingly, the Attorney General’s power and authority to investigate and prosecute cases is defined by KRS 15.200. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 10 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2012 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed a trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment, KRS 218A.240(1) provided the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) with clear authority to make arrests regarding controlled substances, and the indictments were valid. KRS 15.020 had nothing to do with the investigative authority of the OAG, other than recognizing that which may have existed at common law, and KRS 15.200(1) was a limitation on the prosecutorial authority of the OAG.

Based on an incorrect interpretation of KRS 218A.240(1), it was error to deny appellant’s motion to dismiss his indictments. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 10 (Ky. Ct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1980 amendment to KRS 95.440(2) repealed by implication this section, and a police officer, who was not a qualified voter of the county containing his city of employment, did not qualify as a police officer of that city.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because this section applies equally to the class of all police officers throughout the state and is sufficiently supported by the reason that the safety of the police requires the most competent and qualified individuals available from the largest applicant pool, it is not special legislation and does not violate Ky.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under Ky. Const., § 234, a policeman is required to reside within the city in which he is employed. OAG 68-358.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions herein repeal by implication the residential requirements of KRS 88.170 (repealed) with respect to a town marshal of a city of the sixth class. The town marshal is no longer required to be a resident and legal voter of such city. OAG 70-3.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions herein repeal by implication the residential requirements of KRS 61.300(1)(b) with respect to a deputy sheriff. Thus a deputy sheriff is no longer required to meet the terms of KRS 61.300(1)(b) as to residence. OAG 70-34. (Opinion prior to 1980 amendment of KRS 61.300).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person would not be disqualified from serving as chief of police of a city of the third class where he has only resided in the city and county for one day and is not a qualified voter of either the city or the county. OAG 70-49.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No person is disqualified from holding a position as a peace officer by reason of his residency or voting eligibility except as provided in the Constitution. OAG 70-49.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A deputy constable is not disqualified from serving in that capacity because of his residing in a district other than that in which the constable resides. OAG 70-187.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither the marshal, deputy marshal nor policemen are required to possess the residential and voting qualifications required under KRS 88.170 (repealed) or Ky. Const., § 234, since the enactment of this section. OAG 71-336.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the repealing effect of this section on KRS 88.170 (repealed) and since Ky. Const., § 234 only applies to those officers directly named and designated in the Constitution, the marshal is not required to live within the city boundaries of the city in which he is marshal. OAG 73-634.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A chief of police is a “peace officer” and not a “city officer” and does not have to reside within the city he serves as chief. OAG 73-834.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county police officer is not a constitutional officer for the purpose of residency under the Kentucky Constitution; thus, pursuant to this section, limiting residency and voting qualifications to constitutional officers, the residency requirements of KRS 61.300 and 70.540 do not apply. OAG 74-581.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section repeals by implication KRS 61.300 and, since a deputy sheriff is not an officer named and designated in the text of the Constitution, he is not required by Ky. Const., § 234 to reside in the county in which he serves. OAG 75-52.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since peace officers are not disqualified from holding their positions by reason of residency, a city of the sixth class could employ a town marshal who does not live within the city limits. OAG 76-188.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section remains effective irrespective of the subsequent amendments to KRS 61.300, 63.180, and 95.710 and consequently controls the residency requirements for police officers in cities of the fifth class. OAG 79-505.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislative intent in passing this section was to eliminate any and all residency requirements for elected and nonelected peace officers as long as they are not mentioned in the Constitution, thereby permitting the employment of policemen in all classes of cities regardless of where they reside as long as it is in Kentucky. OAG 79-505.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county ordinance requiring deputy sheriffs to complete a two-week peace officer course at the Kentucky Bureau of Training within six months of appointment, qualify on a pistol range and purchase a minimum of $100,000 professional liability insurance as minimum qualifications for deputy sheriffs is invalid since it conflicts with the various requirements of KRS 70.030, KRS 61.300, and this section which preempt the field of deputy qualifications. OAG 81-35.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not in conflict with Ky. Const., §§ 100, 101 or 234, as relates to the sheriff and constable, since the waiver of residency requirement is expressly declared to be not effective for constitutional officers. OAG 82-105.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 61.300(2), which establishes a two-year residency requirement for certain peace officers, repeals by implication this section, which waives the residency requirements for peace officers, to the extent of their conflict; thus a deputy sheriff is required to have resided in the county of appointment for a period of at least two years. OAG 83-491.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A city council may pass an ordinance requiring employes to be city residents but policemen would be exempt from such requirement under this section. OAG 84-76.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 95.440 was amended subsequent to the enactment of this section, and the amended statute repealed by implication the provisions of this section, even though the amendment did not relate to residency; as a consequence, police officers are governed by KRS 95.440 and 95.710, requiring county residency. The statutory requirement, that of county residency for police officers, cannot be altered by a city ordinance requiring city residency, as such would constitute a direct conflict. OAG 85-2, withdrawing opinions to the contrary — see OAG 71-246, 73-461, 73-556, 76-416, 78-268, 79-369, 79-505, 80-68, 82-225.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The reason stated in the emergency clause of Acts 1982, ch. 246 which act deals generally with a surcharge upon certain insurance premiums collected in the state which is intended to fund a trust for the payment of incentives to the fire fighters and policemen of the various municipalities, to the effect that the general fund appropriations for fiscal year 1981-82 for the professional fire fighters foundation program fund as provided by KRS 95A.200 through 95A.990, and the law enforcement foundation program fund as provided by KRS 15.410 through 15.510, would lapse on June 30, 1982, sufficiently supported the legislative declaration of an emergency.

OAG 75-375; 76-361.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since by the Department of Justice (now Justice Cabinet) regulations a police officer’s base salary does not include overtime pay, the fifteen percent (15%) incentive funds reimbursed to a police department would not include fifteen percent (15%) of overtime pay. OAG 77-89.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a city erroneously paid Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund funds to one of its injured policemen, and the policeman subsequently resigned asking for a refund of his contributions to the pension fund pursuant to KRS 95.620(2), the city had to refund the funds to KLEFPF or risk having its participation terminated; the policeman should have also repaid such funds to the city, but if he did not the pension fund trustees could not withhold his contributions to the fund since if the trustees elected to return such contributions they had to refund all of such contributions and could not withhold a sum from the contributions representing what he owed to KLEFPF. OAG 78-385.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund (KLEFPF) reimburses a police department $2,500 per year for each eligible police officer who must be paid such sum. If such officers work overtime (beyond 40 hours per week), the local police department is required to pay said officer overtime pay, including KLEFPF money in determining such overtime rate, just as it would be so required if none of the officer’s salary were reimbursed by KLEFPF.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The salary supplement which a local unit of government receives from the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund (KLEFPF) for its qualified police officers in the program should either go to the qualified officers or be refunded to the KLEFPF if overpayment results; the governmental unit has no right to any part of the officers’ money. Accordingly, even though a particular officer received no base salary for the three days he was off (without annual leave or sick leave balance), he was entitled to his KLEFPF incentive pay money for that month.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mayor of a city of the fifth class, acting under the discretionary power given him by KRS 83A.080(2), removed the city’s chief of police from office without first holding a due process hearing, this section, which set certain administrative due process rights for police officers, had no application since the chief’s removal was not predicated upon any complaint of professional misconduct or upon any charge involving violation of any local unit of government rule or regulation, and, therefore, the mayor acted within his statutory authority. McCloud v. Whitt, 639 S.W.2d 375, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 246 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a university police officer’s termination from employment was based on an internal departmental investigation rather than being commenced by a citizen’s complaint, KRS 15.520 did not apply. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 230 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police officer argued that his termination violated the due process and hearing protections afforded to police officers under KRS 15.520; however, the appellate court found that KRS 15.520 only applied when disciplinary action was taken against a police officer based upon a citizen complaint, and since the officer’s termination resulted from an internal police investigation without a citizen complaint, the provisions of KRS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>15.520 did not apply. Beavers v. City of Berea, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 1 (Ky. Ct. App. Jan. 6, 2012).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 78.445 and this section do not require that disciplinary proceedings must necessarily emanate from a citizen’s sworn complaint. While disciplinary action may rest upon the sworn allegation of a complaining citizen, this does not preclude disciplinary action by the departmental authority based upon initiation from within and upon any source of information. McDaniel v. Walp, 747 S.W.2d 613, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 621 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987), abrogated in part, Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reviewing court does not have the authority to review the penalty determination of the Civil Service Board and does not have the power to reverse the disciplinary action taken by the Board. Louisville by Kuster v. Milligan, 798 S.W.2d 454, 1990 Ky. LEXIS 114 (Ky. 1990).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A discharged employee in a Circuit Court upon judicial review is entitled to something less than a trial de novo, a quasi trial de novo as it were; the trial court in its review is to consider both the transcript and additional testimony, and it is limited to a determination of whether the administrative body acted arbitrarily in deciding whether the employee violated the rules and regulations of the police department. Stallins v. Madisonville, 707 S.W.2d 349, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1034 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The function of the hearing body in instances of charges against police officers is to make two determinations: first, whether the officer has violated the rules and regulations of the department and if so, second, it must exercise its discretion in imposing a penalty. The first is subject to judicial review; the second is not. Stallins v. Madisonville, 707 S.W.2d 349, 1986 Ky. App. LEXIS 1034 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judicial estoppel did not bar an appellate court from considering the applicability of KRS 15.520 to a university police officer’s administrative disciplinary proceeding where the university initially conceded that KRS 15.520 applied, but then it reversed its course before the administrative proceeding was over. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 230 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9) permit a local executive authority such as a mayor to terminate the employment of a nonelected city official such as a police officer only if there is no statute which provides otherwise; KRS 95.765 is such a statute, and requires that a disciplinary hearing be conducted before the legislative body rather than before the mayor. Madisonville v. Sisk, 783 S.W.2d 885, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 15 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mayor or other local executive authority may not receive a citizen’s complaint against a police officer and then fire the officer based on that complaint without ever affording the officer a right to publicly defend against the complaint; in such a situation, the officer is entitled to a due process hearing. City of Munfordville v. Sheldon, 977 S.W.2d 497, 1998 Ky. LEXIS 135 (Ky. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police officers were not non-elected city officers for purposes of Independence, Ky., Code of Ordinances § 31.35(C), and a police captain was not entitled to a termination hearing before an attorney appointed by the city council; the city’s mayor, as the “appointing authority”, was authorized to conduct the hearing. Howard v. City of Independence, 199 S.W.3d 741, 2005 Ky. App. LEXIS 230 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005), abrogated in part, Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 998 (Ky. Ct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police captain was afforded due process in his termination hearing where, inter alia, he was represented by counsel at all stages, the hearing was recorded and transcribed, the police captain’s counsel examined and cross-examined witnesses, and many of his motions and objections were sustained.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>motion to dismiss plaintiff police officer’s claim brought under the Police Officer’s Bill of Rights was denied because although the officer might have been generally aware of the reasons for his termination (i.e., the ending criminal charges), there was no indication that actual, written notice of the specific charges against him was provided within 24 hours of his suspension as required by KRS 15.520(1)(b). Thus, the officer stated a viable claim which fell outside the administrative hearing context of KRS 15.520(1)(h). Seger v. City of Lancaster, 930 F. Supp. 2d 821, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35540 (E.D.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where police officer shot at intruder who had broken into his home, and where the shooting was directed in part at a moving car in which the intruder was fleeing, the fact that said officer had 19 years of unblemished service and he testified that he was not only attempting to arrest a fleeing suspect, but that he also believed he was defending his home and a person living in his home who had previously been assaulted by the intruder, under the circumstances, the Civil Service Board had the authority to determine that dismissal was not justified and was clearly erroneous.

Any technical violation of KRS 15.520(1)(d) was remedied by the officer’s reinstatement with full back pay before termination occurred and before any accompanying hearing was held, and the remedy occurred well within 60 days of plaintiff’s suspension. Seger v. City of Lancaster, 930 F. Supp. 2d 821, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35540 (E.D. Ky. 2013).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals erred in affirming a circuit court's dismissal of two police officers' disciplinary complaints because the officers were improperly denied the due process protections provided by the police officer's Bill of Rights where the statute contained no explicit suggestion that the administrative due process rights provided therein were not available to officers confronting intra-departmental complaints,the very idea of standards and of setting administrative due process rights denoted uniformity. Pearce v. Univ. of Louisville, 448 S.W.3d 746, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 605 (Ky. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Members of the police and fire departments of an urban county government who have had criminal charges filed against them cannot be suspended from duty by the appointing authority or the head of their departments pending final disposition of the criminal charges, without following the procedures and requirements set forth in KRS 95.450 which require that charges be preferred and hearings conducted by the legislative body in connection with the persons whose suspensions are sought or who have been suspended. OAG 80-655.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the mayor under the councilmanic form of government has the sole authority under KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9) to remove nonelected officers and employees, he, rather than the council, would have the responsibility of hearing disciplinary charges against a police officer unless he has promulgated a hearing proceeding otherwise that has been approved by the council under KRS 83A.130(4); on the other hand, the council could, under the authority of KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9), enact an ordinance establishing a hearing board to hear the charges, the members of which are to be appointed by the mayor with the approval of the council under KRS 83A.080(2). OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (1)(h) of this section when read in conjunction with the section as a whole clearly implies that police officers against whom complaints are filed are entitled to a due process hearing as therein provided though admittedly the statutory language of subsection (1)(h) of this section is somewhat ambiguous; the use of the phrase “when a hearing is to be conducted by any appointing authority … ” simply means that a hearing is predicated on the initial finding by the authority or body designated to take action in the matter and that the complaint is not frivolous and thus warrants a full investigation to determine its authenticity. OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing under this section that would prohibit a so-called ranking officer (mayor or police chief) from preferring charges against an officer arising from the same incident involving a citizen who declines to make his complaint under oath, provided sufficient evidence is deemed available relating to the incident outside of that which the citizen has sole knowledge of, but refuses to furnish under oath. OAG 81-48.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mayor of a fourth-class city can fire the chief of police for insubordination by executive order, unless the officer is under civil service or the police department is funded under the Law Enforcement Foundation Program, in which case the officer can only be removed pursuant to a hearing as provided in this section. OAG 81-132.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mayor of a fifth-class city may not give a police commissioner or any one member of the city council authority to hire and fire on the police force since only the mayor can hire members of the police department or any other nonelective officer with the approval of the city legislative body; however, he may remove members of the police department or other nonelective officers at will, unless the officer is under civil service or the police department participates in the Law Enforcement Foundation Program under this section, or the city legislative body has enacted an ordinance to the effect that no nonelected officer or police officer can be removed without legal cause and a hearing. OAG 81-133.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a complaint against a police officer results in a hearing, the officer must be given notice a minimum of three days before the hearing as required by this section rather than two days prior as required by KRS 95.450, since this section was the later enacted of the two sections and under general rules of statutory construction the later act prevails where there is a conflict between two acts. OAG 81-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where charges are filed against a police officer, the requirement that the hearing be held within three days after charges have been filed with the legislative body under KRS 95.450 is superseded by the provisions under this section to the effect that the hearing must be held within 60 days following the filing of any charges. OAG 81-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where charges are to be filed regarding a complaint against a police officer, such charges must be filed with the clerk of the legislative body as required by KRS 95.450, since this section appears to be silent as to the person with whom charges are to be filed. OAG 81-134.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A part-time police officer in a fourth-class city who receives state funds as part of his salary is not entitled to the protection of a hearing under this section which provides, in subsection (4), that the hearing provision only applies to police officers who receive supplemental pay from the Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund, since the supplemental pay only applies to “full-time” members of the local police department under KRS 15.420. OAG 81-200.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purposes of this section are to establish a system of professional conduct for the police officers of units of local government, to establish administrative due process rights for police officers of local units of government and to provide a means of redress by citizens for wrongs allegedly done to them by police officers. OAG 83-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, in part, establishes administrative due process rights for municipal police officers charged with professional misconduct or violations of municipal rules and regulations; thus, if a city’s proposed policy of documenting the work performances of its employees involves charging police officers with professional misconduct or with violations of municipal rules and regulations, the city must adhere to the provisions of this section requiring notification to the police officers of the charges and a hearing relative to those charges, assuming the city and its police officers are participating in the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund. OAG 83-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a city’s police officers are receiving funds from the Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund, then those officers are entitled to the protections afforded police officers by this section. OAG 83-114.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No due process hearing is required prior to removal of a city police officer in absence of a civil service requirement, even under the terms of this section, except where removal is predicated upon a complaint of professional misconduct in violation of this section, in which case the procedure under this section would have to be followed.

Both legislative decisions are legitimate and logical classifications. Graham v. Mills, 694 S.W.2d 698, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1985).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit clerks are not at all subject to the supervision of prosecutors, but of the judiciary, and the fact that a warrant must be prepared by the Commonwealth’s or county attorney has nothing to do with the clerk’s exercise of independent judgment in deciding whether probable cause has been shown to justify issuance of warrant; furthermore, the determination of probable cause is made not from the warrant but from the supporting affidavit or affidavits.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section specifically provides that a county clerk can issue a criminal warrant prepared by a county attorney when no district judge, circuit judge or trial commissioner is available, the authority to sign the judge’s name to an arrest warrant cannot be delegated to the county attorney since Ky. Const., § 28, prohibits anyone in one branch of government from exercising the power in another branch of government, the county attorney being in the executive branch under Ky. Const., § 99, and the judicial branch being under Ky. Const., § 109. Dugger v. Off 2nd, Inc., 612 S.W.2d 756, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 425 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “total compensation as county attorney which he received during the calendar year 1976” means “the incumbent county attorney” instead of “he” and therefore, the compensation of that office in 1976 is the measure of the prosecutorial compensation of a county attorney serving in January, 1978, and thereafter, and there is no difference in compensation of a county attorney who was not in office in 1976 and a county attorney who was; the county attorney in 1978, regardless of whether he ever served as county attorney before 1978 or not, should receive from the state for his prosecutorial duties an amount equal to the total compensation received by the incumbent county attorney as compensation for his public duties in that office.

OAG 77-125.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under current law the compensation of county attorneys generally will be funded by the state treasury (prosecutorial duties) and by the county treasury (civil county duties). OAG 78-113.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no legal basis for deducting actual expenses or the expense allowance from a county attorney’s earned and collected fees, commissions and salary. OAG 78-209.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Total compensation,” as mentioned in this section, can only refer to the totality of earned and collected fees, commissions and any salary paid out of the county treasury and does not include the county attorney’s expense allowance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature intended the $250 per month allowance to relate to residual civil functions performed for the state other than criminal prosecutions; neither this allowance nor the allowance under KRS 15.750 is compensation and no formal accountability is required, except that the expenses claimed under KRS 15.750(3) must be documented as required by the Executive Department for Finance and Administration (now Finance and Administration Cabinet).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Current legislation does not guarantee, by way of salaries from the state and county, that the county attorney shall receive the annual rubber dollar maximum. OAG 78-243.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a fiscal court fixed the salary of the county attorney at $150 per month, commencing January 1, 1978, and after he took office in January, 1978, the fiscal court entered an order raising his salary to $600 per month thereby increasing his annual salary from $1800 per year to $7200 per year, there was no prohibited change in his compensation, as is prohibited by Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county attorney, who in Kentucky performs the dual function of prosecutor in the district court and civil attorney for the county, has his total compensation from state and county combined geared to the consumer price index formula under subsection (1) of this section and the Legislature intended that the prosecutorial compensation be based upon the total compensation received as county attorney in 1976, subject each year to the actual yearly advancement of the consumer price index and subject to the statutory minimum of $7,200 under subsection (1) of this section; thus, the statutory maximum under subsection (3) of this section for 1981 is $43,429.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An assistant county attorney could serve as a lobbyist for a private interest group during the session of the General Assembly so long as it does not interfere or conflict with the duties of his office. OAG 77-773.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A part-time assistant county attorney who is appointed to the membership of the Kentucky Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission is not eligible to receive per diem compensation for his service on the Commission in light of the clear language of KRS 34.320. OAG 80-127.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county attorney is a county constitutional officer, pursuant to Ky. Const., § 99, and, therefore, an assistant county attorney is a statutory county officer for the purpose of considering the general question of incompatibility of offices; since the office of assistant county attorney involves only one office, a county constitutional office, no incompatibility exists even though the county attorney has been given state duties as a prosecutor (KRS 15.725(2)) and county duties as an adviser to fiscal court (KRS 69.210). OAG 80-341.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assistant county attorneys are county employees when hired by an elected county attorney to work for the county, despite their affiliation with the Unified Prosecutorial System for the purpose of uniform enforcement of criminal law and administration of criminal justice, and they are not subject to the provisions of KRS Chapter 18A on compensation except to the extent that this section requires that salaries established by the Prosecutors Advisory Council be comparable with the classification and compensation plan for comparable positions maintained by the Department of Personnel.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While assistant county attorneys are appointed with the approval of the Prosecutors Advisory Council, salaries are merely comparable with the classification and compensation plan for comparable positions maintained by the state department of personnel, pursuant to KRS 64.640, not synonymous with them.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> With the exceptions specified in this section, KRS 16.150, 16.160, and 16.196 to 16.199, no officer of the department shall be removed, suspended, reduced in grade or pay for any reason except inefficiency, misconduct, insubordination, or violation of law or of any administrative regulation promulgated by the commissioner. Any person may prefer charges in writing against any officer or individual employed as a Trooper R Class, which shall be filed in the Office of Internal Affairs, which shall be designated by the commissioner as the recipient of charges and shall be administratively responsible for the maintenance of good order within the department through the collection and investigation of charges and the retention of their dispositions. The charges shall be signed by the person making the same, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall prefer charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part. If the officer admits the truthfulness of the charges, the commissioner shall remove, suspend, reduce in rank or pay the officer so offending, in proportion to the seriousness of the charges.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If the charges are denied and the officer demands a hearing within the time above specified, he shall make his demand known to the commissioner in writing. After demand for hearing has been made, the commissioner within twenty (20) days from the date thereof shall arrange for a public hearing before a trial board to be constituted in the manner provided in this section. The officer defendant shall be given not less than twenty (20) days’ notice of the time, place, and hour of the hearing.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Upon the hearing, all charges shall be considered traversed and put in issue, and the trial shall be confined and limited to the issues presented by the written charges. The trial board hearing the charges may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or sittings, by subpoena issued by the commissioner and served upon any witness by any sheriff or other person authorized by law to serve process. If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board, or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The officer defendant shall have the right to subpoena in his behalf any witnesses he may desire, upon furnishing their names to the trial board or to the commissioner. The officer shall likewise have the right to appear in person and by counsel.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> All charges against the officer defendant, together with all proceedings before the trial board, shall be transcribed and reduced to writing and a permanent record kept thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> In any instance where the commissioner has probable cause to believe that an officer has been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, he may immediately suspend the officer from duty, or from both pay and duty, pending trial, and the officer shall not be again placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until a determination of the charges under this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> The trial board, after hearing the charges, shall fix the punishment of any officer found guilty of any one (1) or more charges, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time not to exceed six (6) months, or by reducing the grade if the officer’s classification warrants same, or by combining any two (2) or more of the punishments, or by reducing the monthly salary of the officer by not more than twenty percent (20%) for not more than six (6) months, or by removing or dismissing from the service of the department any officer so found guilty.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> For the purpose of hearing charges against any officer, as set forth in this section, there is created a trial board, which shall consist of the commissioner and of a panel of ten (10) officers of the department appointed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall designate from the panel not less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) members thereof to hear charges against any officer in the manner and under the procedure above set forth. The commissioner may promulgate reasonable administrative regulations governing the procedure before the trial board, which do not conflict with this section. The panel or trial board shall be a continuing body, and the officers designated shall serve thereon in addition to their other duties and without any increase in compensation, except they may be reimbursed for meals, lodging, and traveling expenses incurred while in the performance of their official duties as members of the board. Any officer defendant may for cause challenge the right of any member of the board in the trial of any action against him, and if the remaining members of the board find that the challenge is justifiable, the member of the board shall be excused from hearing the charges, and another member substituted in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> No officer is entitled to a hearing as provided in this section, unless his suspension is for more than twenty (20) days, or his pay reduced more than ten percent (10%); but if the officer receives more than twenty (20) days’ suspension or reduction in salary of more than ten percent (10%) within a period of one (1) year, he shall have the right to such hearing in the manner above provided.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(10)</b> Any civilian employee may be discharged, suspended, or reduced in pay at any time by the commissioner, pursuant to KRS Chapter 18A.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(11)</b> Any officer appointed to the department shall be considered on probation for a period of one (1) year from and after the date of his appointment, and during that period may be discharged or suspended or reduced in rank or pay, with or without cause, by the commissioner. The rights conferred upon an officer for a hearing, as provided in this section, shall not accrue until the officer has been employed by the department for a period of one (1) year or more.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> With the exceptions specified in this section and KRS 16.193, no officer commissioned under KRS 16.186 to 16.195 shall be removed, suspended, or reduced in grade or pay for any reason except inefficiency, misconduct, insubordination, or violation of law or of any administrative regulation promulgated by the commissioner. Any person may present charges in writing against any officer, which shall be filed with the Office of Internal Affairs, which shall be designated by the commissioner as the recipient of charges and shall be administratively responsible for the maintenance of good order within the department through the collection and investigation of charges and the retention of their dispositions. The charges shall be signed by the person filing the charges, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall present charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand a public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part. If the officer admits the truthfulness of the charges, the commissioner shall remove, suspend, or reduce in rank or pay the officer so offending, in proportion to the seriousness of the charges.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If the charges are denied and the officer demands a hearing within the time specified by subsection (1) of this section, he shall make his demand known to the commissioner in writing. After a demand for hearing has been made by the officer, the commissioner, within twenty (20) days from the date thereof shall arrange for a public hearing before a trial board to be constituted in the manner provided in this section. The officer defendant shall be given not less than twenty (20) days notice of the time, place, and hour of the hearing.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Upon the hearing, all charges shall be considered traversed and put in issue, and the trial shall be confined and limited to the issues presented by the written charges. The trial board hearing the charges may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or sittings, by subpoena issued by the commissioner and served upon any witness by any sheriff or other person authorized by law to serve process. If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> The officer defendant shall have the right to subpoena in his behalf any witnesses he may desire upon furnishing their names to the trial board or to the commissioner. The officer shall likewise have the right to appear in person and by counsel.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> All charges against the officer defendant, together with all proceedings before the trial board, shall be transcribed and reduced to writing and a permanent record kept thereof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> In any instance where the commissioner has probable cause to believe that an officer has been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, he may immediately suspend the officer from duty, or from both pay and duty, pending trial, and the officer shall not be again placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until a determination of the charges under this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> The trial board, after hearing the charges, shall fix the punishment of any officer found guilty of any one (1) or more charges, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time not to exceed six (6) months, or by reducing the grade if the officer’s classification warrants same, or by combining any two (2) or more of the punishments, or by reducing the monthly salary of the officer by not more than twenty percent (20%) for not more than six (6) months, or by removing or dismissing from the service of the department any officer so found guilty.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> For the purpose of hearing charges against any officer, as set forth in this section, there is created a trial board, which shall consist of the commissioner and a panel of ten (10) officers of the department appointed by the commissioner which shall be composed of six (6) commercial vehicle enforcement officers, two (2) facilities security officers, one (1) arson investigator officer, and one (1) hazardous devices investigator officer. The commissioner shall designate from the panel seven (7) members consisting of four (4) commercial vehicle enforcement officers, one (1) facilities security officer, one (1) arson investigator officer, and one (1) hazardous devices investigator officer, to hear charges against any officer in the manner and under the procedures established by this section. The commissioner may promulgate reasonable administrative regulations governing the procedure before the trial board that do not conflict with this section. The panel or trial board shall be a continuing body and the officers designated shall serve on the board or panel in addition to their other duties without any increase in compensation, except they may be reimbursed for meals, lodging, and traveling expenses incurred while in the performance of their official duties as members of the board or panel. Any officer defendant may for cause challenge the right of any member of the board in the trial of any action against him, and if the remaining members of the board find that the challenge is justifiable, the member of the board shall be excused from hearing the charges, and another member substituted from the panel.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> No officer is entitled to a hearing as provided in this section unless his suspension is for more than twenty (20) days, or his pay reduced more than ten percent (10%), except that if the officer receives more than twenty (20) days suspension or reduction in salary of more than ten percent (10%) within a period of one (1) year, he shall have the right to a hearing as provided by this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(10)</b> Any officer appointed to the department under this section shall be considered on probation for a period of one (1) year from and after the date of his appointment, and during that period may be discharged or suspended or reduced in rank or pay, with or without cause, by the commissioner. The rights conferred upon an officer for a hearing, as provided in this section, shall not accrue until the officer has been employed by the department for a period of one (1) year or more.</p>

However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex.

Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

Notwithstanding any statutes, administrative regulations, and policies to the contrary, if standards and technologies other than those set by the Commonwealth Office of Technology are required, the executive director of the Commonwealth Office of Technology shall review, expedite, and grant appropriate exemptions to effectuate the purposes of the unified criminal justice information system. Nothing in this section shall be construed to hamper any public officer or official, agency, or organization of state or local government from furnishing information or data that they are required or requested to furnish and which they are allowed to procure by law, to the General Assembly, the Legislative Research Commission, or a committee of either. For the purposes of this section, “criminal justice agencies” include all departments of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet except the Department of Public Advocacy, the Unified Prosecutorial System, Commonwealth’s attorneys, county attorneys, the Transportation Cabinet, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, and any agency with the authority to issue a citation or make an arrest.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The program to design, implement, and maintain the system shall be under the supervision of the executive director of the Office of Homeland Security, in consultation with the executive director of the Commonwealth Office of Technology and the Administrative Office of the Courts.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once prosecution is complete and final disposition is made, police records of a case are open to public inspection.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is within the discretion of the police to decide whether a case is active, inactive or finally closed, but when a demand for inspection of records is refused the burden is on the police to justify the refusal of the inspection with specificity; therefore, where the missing person’s file had been maintained as an open case (active or inactive as opposed to closed) for almost eight years, the public agency’s mere reference to subdivision (1)(f) (now (1)(h)) of KRS 61.878 and this section, with no additional explanation, did not meet the burden of proof imposed by law relative to a denial of inspection.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Sex Offender Registration Act, KRS 17.500 et seq., is not intended to punish sex offenders and, therefore, the act does not impose an additional punishment and is not an ex post facto law under the United States Constitution or Kentucky Constitution.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sexual Offender Registration Act, KRS 17.500 et seq. (Act), violated neither state nor federal constitutional provisions as the Act was remedial and not punitive in nature so it did not violate ex post facto laws; the legislature permissibly granted the trial court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Act to carry out its provisions such that there was no separation of powers violation, defendants right to privacy was not outweighed by public interest in people being able to protect themselves from sex offenders, and Act was not a bill of attainder since it neither inflicted punishment nor adjudicated guilt. Hyatt v. Commonwealth, 72 S.W.3d 566, 2002 Ky. LEXIS 18 (Ky. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 909, 123 S. Ct. 1481, 155 L. Ed. 2d 230, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 2026 (U.S. 2003).</p>

While a sex offender’s past conduct is the reason he or she is required to register, the failure to register occurs in the present; an increase in the degree of the offense for failing to register would only present an ex post facto issue if the act of failing to register occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The inclusion of kidnapping as an offense requiring registration under the Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 et seq., even where not sexually-motivated, is rationally related to the Kentucky General Assembly’s stated purpose of protecting minors from crime and potential sexual assaults. As such, the Commonwealth does not violate an individual’s substantive due process rights by forcing him or her to register under KSORA based on a kidnapping conviction. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 et seq., is nonpunitive; therefore, one required to register thereunder cannot maintain an Eighth Amendment claim predicated on its enforcement. Because KSORA does not impose punishment but is regulatory in nature, it does not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v.

Commonwealth v. Newman, 145 S.W.3d 416, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS 17.500 (2000), applies to any person who is required to register by its terms and requires registration by anyone being released by the court, the parole board, the cabinet, or any detention facility who was 18 years or older at the time of the offense if the offense was a sex crime or was an enumerated offense against a minor. A criminal offense against a minor is defined to include kidnapping in violation of KRS 509.040; the 2000 amendments require lifetime registration for any person convicted of kidnapping in violation of KRS 509.040, if the victim was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant did not make an objection in either the trial or appellate court, defendant’s claim that defendant was not required to register as a sex offender had to be reviewed by the state supreme court for manifest injustice pursuant to RCr P. 10.26. Since no showing was made that defendant had to register under any version of the Sex Offenders Registration Act, KRS 17.500 et seq., defendant could not be found guilty of the crime of failing to register and the indictment lodged against defendant charging that offense had to be dismissed. Commonwealth v. Nash, 338 S.W.3d 264, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 80 (Ky. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the grant of the employer’s motion to dismiss was proper because the Sex Offender Registration Act did not create a public policy exception to the terminable-at-will doctrine. Despite the underlying public policy of protecting the public from sex offenders and the immunity provided by the Act, it did not provide an explicit right to disseminate information from the registry in a private workplace.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510(10) was not unconstitutionally vague in requiring a registered sex offender who knew he or she would have a change of address to inform authorities; it was the failure to give notice of one’s change in residence, not homelessness, that was prohibited. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 396 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1042 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2007), aff'd, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of former KRS 17.510(7) to define “residence” did not cause the statute to be unconstitutionally vague because the language of the statute was sufficiently definite to put defendant on notice that if defendant failed to register as a sex offender when defendant moved from Tennessee, where defendant was registered as a sex offender, to Kentucky, defendant would be guilty of a crime. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 52 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510(10)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because, even though defendant became homeless when he was expelled from a center where he was living, this fact was irrelevant to the statute’s application; the statute did not require that a registrant must have had an actual place he was moving to. Further, KRS 17.510(10)(a) as written did not cause arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement and did not criminalize being homeless because all sex offenders, regardless of socioeconomic status, had to register with the proper authorities and report any change in address. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2006 amendment to KRS 17.510(11), which reclassified the failure to register from a misdemeanor to a felony, did not constitute a violation of a sex offender’s constitutional rights to be free from ex post facto laws because the amendment did not have a real and direct effect on the punishment for a sex offender’s past crimes but served only to affect the punishment for his commission of a future crime. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 178 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Amendments to Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), KRS 17.510, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution or the Kentucky Constitution because any potential punishment arising from violation of SORA was totally prospective and was not punishment for defendant’s past criminal behavior. Buck v. Commonwealth, 308 S.W.3d 661, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 95 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any potential punishment arising from the violation of the Kentucky Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), KRS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>17.500 et seq., is totally prospective and is not punishment for past criminal behavior. While a sex offender’s past conduct is the reason he or she is required to register, the failure to register occurs in the present; an increase in the degree of the offense for failing to register would only present an ex post facto issue if the act of failing to register occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 17.510 (2000) is aimed at both sex crimes and crimes against minors, and that provides support that the Kentucky General Assembly’s purpose for including kidnapping a minor in the list of offenses requiring registration was aimed at protecting children from crime in general, not just sexually-related crime. Thus, inclusion of those convicted of a kidnapping involving a minor is rationally related to the General Assembly’s intent to protect children from crime. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104516 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 247, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Applicability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not required to register as a sex offender, and charges against him for failure to register were properly dismissed, where he was convicted in 1990, more than four (4) years before the effective date of the Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), KRS 17.500 et seq., and was discharged from prison approximately three (3) years before the effective date of the Act. Commonwealth v. Newman, 145 S.W.3d 416, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 262 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant was prosecuted under former KRS 17.510(7) for failing to register as a sex offender after defendant was convicted of a sex crime in Tennessee, registered as a sex offender there, and moved to Kentucky, the fact that defendant’s crime was committed before KRS 17.510(11) was amended did not cause the trial court to lack jurisdiction to convict defendant of a felony because defendant moved to Kentucky, and failed to register, after the statute was amended. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009 Ky. LEXIS 52 (Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>From a plain reading of KRS 17.510(11), it is clear that the state legislature intended to expand the coverage of the felony penalty to include all registered sex offenders. By expressly providing that a sex offender’s first violation of the current version or prior versions of the sex offender law constitutes a Class D felony, the legislature intended to establish a uniform penalty for all sex offenders. As such, a sex offender’s violation of the registration law after the effective date of the 2006 amendment constituted a felony even if he would have been subject only to a misdemeanor under the law in effect at the time he was first required to register. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 178 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 17.510(7) requires sex offender registration of any person who was required to register in another state upon that person's relocation to Kentucky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Requiring defendant to register as a sex offender for a term of 10 years was not an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>ex post facto</i> application of the Kentucky Sexual Offender Registration Act (Act),<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 17.500 et seq., although registration was not required for second-degree sexual abuse under the 1994 version of the statute in effect at the time of his offenses; former KRS 17.495 (see now<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 17.545) was not an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>ex post facto</i> law because it applied only to those on probation and parole, imposed no conditions that could not have been imposed on such persons before its enactment, did not extend a defendant’s time behind bars, and was reasonably related to nonpunitive goals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thorpe v. Commonwealth, 2003 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1016 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 17.520(2)(a)(4), because the legislature had directed that lifetime registration was mandatory for conviction for two felony crimes against a minor, neither the trial court nor the Commonwealth could provide any lesser requirement; however, defendant should have been permitted to withdraw his plea because the trial court had reason to know the registration period was an essential element of defendant’s agreement to plead guilty, and he was misinformed on the law. Buford v. Commonwealth, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 187 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court did not err in imposing statutory residency restrictions on defendant upon his conviction for kidnapping as kidnapping was explicitly included in KRS 17.500(3)(a)(1) in the definition of a “criminal offense against a victim who is a minor,” if the victim was under the age of eighteen, and defendant was clearly a “registrant” subject to lifetime registration pursuant to KRS 17.520(2)(a)(1) and 17.545. Ladriere v. Commonwealth, 329 S.W.3d 278, 2010 Ky. LEXIS 259 (Ky. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>2. Lifetime Registration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in requiring defendant, who was 15 at the time of the offenses, to register for lifetime as a sexual offender pursuant to KRS 17.520 upon defendant’s convictions on two (2) counts of first-degree sexual abuse; none of the sections in KRS 17.520 requiring lifetime registration applied to defendant, in that defendant’s conduct was criminal based solely upon the age of the victims, not because he had used forcible compulsion, and as a result, the trial court should have applied KRS 17.500(2)(b) to exempt defendant from the lifetime registration requirement. Dever v. Commonwealth, 300 S.W.3d 198, 2009 Ky. App. LEXIS 1 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to advise of the lifetime registration requirement for a sex offender pursuant to statute does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because the requirement is nonpunitive and designed to protect the public. Therefore, an applicant was not entitled to postconviction relief based on the failure to give such advice in a case where he entered a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor. Embry v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.3d 264, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 159 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015), overruled in part, Commonwealth v. Thompson, 548 S.W.3d 881, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Movant seeking postconviction relief must offer some proof of his claims to justify relief; bare allegations in the motion will not justify granting extraordinary relief. Therefore, an applicant's bare allegation that counsel told him that he would only have to register as a sex offender for a decade after entering a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor was insufficient to prove that relief was justified. Embry v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.3d 264, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 159 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015), overruled in part, Commonwealth v. Thompson, 548 S.W.3d 881, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 260 (Ky. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violations of federal procedural or substantive due process rights occurred when a person convicted of kidnapping a minor under KRS 509.040 was placed on the sex offender registry pursuant to KRS 17.510(6), 17.520(2)(a), 17.500(3)(a). His registration rationally furthered the state’s interest in protecting children, the registry did not state that he had committed a sex crime, and his vagueness challenge lacked merit. Moffitt v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 247, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 25 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant did not avail himself of the structure for attacking the judgment of conviction of a sex offense that led to defendant being sentenced to probation and that probation later being revoked, defendant was not entitled to relief from that revocation of probation. Although defendant wanted to attack application of KRS 17.520 that tolled the sex offender registration statute as an impermissible ex post facto violation under Ky. Const. § 19, defendant’s failure to use RCr P. 11.42 and CR 60.02 allowing for postconviction relief precluded defendant challenging the conviction. Lucas v. Commonwealth, 380 S.W.3d 554, 2012 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Individual lacked standing to assert a claim that KRS 18A.140(1) chilled his First Amendment free speech rights by preventing him from recommending candidates for state employment on political grounds where KRS 18A.140(1) did not subject the individual to indictment for simply recommending individuals for employment because mere recommendation was very different than appointing, promoting, demoting, or dismissing someone based on political affiliation. The fact that one of the individual’s letters was subject to a subpoena in an ongoing merit system investigation did not lead to the conclusion that he would be indicted, the newspaper articles and statements contained therein did not establish that the individual would be indicted, and as a result, the individual had failed to establish specific present objective harm or threat of specific future harm. Forgy v. Stumbo, 378 F. Supp. 2d 774, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14968 (E.D. Ky. 2005).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a Governor’s blanket pardon for individuals involved in a merit system investigation was valid under Ky. Const. § 77 and there was no evidence that defendant rejected the pardon, the order dismissing the indictment was vacated because the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction and the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the misdemeanor charges under KRS 24A.110. Commonwealth v. Groves, 209 S.W.3d 492, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 345 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a state employee’s 42 USCS § 1983 claims against the Kentucky Transportation Department, its former deputy secretary, and the state Republican Party were largely dismissed due to sovereign and qualified immunity, some individual claims against the former deputy secretary of the state transportation department stood because the freedom of association under the First Amendment was a clearly established constitutional right and KRS 18A.140 prohibited discrimination of merit system employees due to political affiliation. Gritton v. Disponett, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63611 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 6, 2006), aff'd, 332 Fed. Appx. 232, 2009 FED App. 0372N, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 11343 (6th Cir. Ky. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of qualified immunity for supervisors who fired a civil servant allegedly in violation of her First Amendment political-affiliation rights was proper because the civil servant adequately pled a clearly established constitutional violation by claiming she was fired because of and by reason of her political affiliation as a Democrat.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the General Assembly could authorize the earning of annual and sick leave days in advance as part of the emoluments of service in the General Assembly, to grant sick leave after the fact of serving time would be a grant of exclusive public emoluments in violation of Const., § 3. Therefore, the correct interpretation of this section is that General Assembly time may be included in determining total length of service for purposes of figuring the 1 day, 1 1/4 days, 1 1/2 days, or 1 3/4 days of annual leave earned per month for those persons eligible to earn and now earning annual leave, but members of the General Assembly do not earn annual or sick leave while they are in such positions.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> The Commonwealth of Kentucky annual leave sharing program is created. An employee who has accrued an annual leave balance of more than seventy-five (75) hours may request that the appointing authority of the agency for which the employee works makes available for transfer a specified amount of his or her annual leave balance to another named employee authorized to receive leave under subsection (2) of this section. The employee may not request a transfer of an amount of leave that would result in reducing his or her annual leave balance to less than seventy-five (75) hours.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> An appointing authority, with the approval of the secretary of personnel, may permit an employee of the agency to receive leave under this section if:</p>

Transfers of leave shall not exceed the amount requested by the recipient.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Leave may be transferred from an employee of one (1) agency to an employee within the same agency. With the approval of the secretary of personnel and of the appointing authorities of both agencies, leave may be transferred from an employee of one (1) agency to an employee of another state agency. The Personnel Cabinet shall maintain records of leave transferred between employees and the utilization of transferred leave.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> While an employee is on leave transferred under this section, he or she shall be deemed a state employee and shall receive the same treatment with respect to salary, wages, and employee benefits.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> All salary and wage payments made to an employee while on leave transferred under this section shall be made by the agency employing the person receiving the leave.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Any leave transferred under this section that remains unused shall be returned to the employees who transferred the leave when the appointing authority finds that the leave is no longer needed and will not be needed at a future time in connection with the catastrophic loss for which the leave was transferred to an employee in his or her agency.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> No employee shall directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other employee for the purpose of interfering with the employee’s right to voluntarily contribute leave when authorized under this section.
