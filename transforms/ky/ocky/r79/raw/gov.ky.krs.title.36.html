Herring v. Lunderman, 302 Ky. 271, 194 S.W.2d 506, 1946 Ky. LEXIS 650 (Ky. 1946).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for assault, an instruction offered under this section to the effect that the law was for the defendant if the jury believed from the evidence that the conduct of the plaintiff was such as to excuse an ordinarily prudent man in making the assault was properly refused for failing to limit its application to mitigation of punitive damages and for failure to plead provocation as provided by this section. Herring v. Lunderman, 302 Ky. 271, 194 S.W.2d 506, 1946 Ky. LEXIS 650 (Ky. 1946).</p>

Campbell v. Bannister, 79 Ky. 205, 2 Ky. L. Rptr. 72, 1880 Ky. LEXIS 113 (Ky. Ct. App. 1880).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action for libel charging appellee with acting corruptly as a juror and perjuring himself wherein the defendants pleaded the truth of the accusation in justification and, by way of mitigation, also relied upon general rumor that the appellant would act as charged and that defendants had good reasons for their belief that the publication was true, the court held: (1) where the truth of the words was pleaded in justification, it was a complete defense to a civil action for libel and the burden of the issue was upon the defendants; (2) the object of offering matters in mitigation was, as the very name implied, to mitigate the damages that might be recovered and therefore, where recovery was denied, plaintiff was not prejudiced by evidence of any circumstances in mitigation; and (3) the jury having found the publication was in fact true, it was entirely immaterial whether the appellees were or were not actuated by malice, and testimony to that effect was not prejudicial to appellant. McIntyre v. Bransford, 17 S.W. 359, 13 Ky. L. Rptr. 454 (1891).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where publication was admitted and defendant pleaded the truth of the same but utterly failed to sustain the truth, he was guilty of libel and the mere fact that he may have believed that the statements or charges made were true was no defense.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinarily, the truth of an alleged libel must be pleaded as a defense, but that rule can only apply when there is a necessity for such a plea and, if the petition shows that to be true which would be a good defense on plea, the latter becomes unnecessary and a demurrer exposes the infirmity of the petition. Rollins v. Louisville Times Co., 139 Ky. 788, 90 S.W. 1081, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 1054, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. Ct. App. 1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rule is well settled that in a civil action for libel the substantial truth of the publication is a complete defense. Rollins v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rule that the truth of an alleged libel must be pleaded as a defense did not apply and a demurrer reached the defect where the petition alleged that the statement that plaintiff had “left the county and his friends were unable to locate him” was false but, as amended, showed a number of his friends knew his whereabouts and that he had been summoned by the sheriff to appear as a witness in another county and that he returned home the day after the article was published, since the petition showed on its face that he had left the county and that some of his friends did not know where he was. Rollins v. Louisville Times Co., 139 Ky. 788, 90 S.W. 1081, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 1054, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 5 (Ky. Ct. App. 1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant by his plea admitted that he spoke the words alleged except that he did not use the word “dishonestly” and pleaded that the words spoken by him were spoken in confidence and were a privileged communication and, being required to elect whether he would stand by his denial of having charged the plaintiff with taking the goods “dishonestly” or upon his plea of privileged communication, under protest, elected to stand upon the latter defense. The court in its instruction said to the jury that it was admitted by the pleadings that the defendant had spoken the words alleged in the petition, which included the word “dishonestly.” The court held that this was error and prejudicial to the defendant. Shipp v. Patton, 123 Ky. 65, 93 S.W. 1033, 29 Ky. L. Rptr. 480, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 125 (Ky. 1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for libel, pleading and proof of the truth of the written statements is always a complete defense, although the publication may be inspired by malice or ill will and be libelous per se.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petition made no allegation by way of colloquium or innuendo tending to extend the meaning of the written statement or to show that the language of the letter was libelous per se in its statements by reason of their tending to discredit or injure the plaintiff as a public officer, alleging that he was such, and, defendant answered, denying only that he had falsely or maliciously made the statements complained of in the letter as libelous, and where the things set forth as done by defendant were, by complainant’s testimony, shown and admitted to have been in fact done by him, demurrer to the petition should have been sustained and peremptory instruction given to the jury to find for the defendant.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is no justification for a repetition of the slander that it had been reported in the neighborhood or that appellant, at the time he communicated the slander, gave the party to whom he related it the name of the person from whom he learned said report or that he informed him at the time that he did not believe said report to be true, and it cannot be relied on by way of justification that he did not intend to charge appellant with the offense of fornication. It was, however, competent under this action to have inquired of all witnesses whether or not the report spoken of was generally known in the neighborhood, but there the inquiry should have ceased. It was also competent for appellee to prove the fact that he had stated he did not believe the report and that he gave the name of his author and any other mitigating circumstances for the purpose of rebutting actual malice and to escape the infliction of punitive damages. Nicholson v. Rust, 52 S.W. 933, 21 Ky. L. Rptr. 645, 1899 Ky. LEXIS 392 (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, which permits the pleading of mitigating circumstances in connection with a plea of the truth of the alleged slander, does not seem to have changed the common-law rule, and the mitigating circumstances might properly be introduced in evidence under the general issue without a plea setting them forth. Nicholson v. Merritt, 109 Ky. 369, 59 S.W. 25, 22 Ky. L. Rptr. 914, 1900 Ky. LEXIS 214 (Ky. 1900).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it is well settled in this state that although it is no justification to say that defendant merely repeated what he had heard, it is competent for the defendant, in an action of this character, to show in mitigation of damages that the rumor was generally known in the neighborhood, although he will not be permitted to show, in detail, conversations had with different persons with regard to the alleged rumor. Provision of this section which permits the pleading of mitigating circumstances in connection with a plea of the truth of the alleged libel or slander does not seem to have changed the common-law rule that such testimony might have been introduced under the general issue; therefore, such mitigating circumstances might properly be shown without a plea setting them forth.

In the case at bar, the evidence at trial, in which the book was scrutinized in detail, showed that defendant arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff had committed adultery on the basis of rumor and circumstantial evidence which was persuasive to her; the facts on which she based the conclusion were disclosed in the book.

<p class="p6">If the demand for correction has specified two (2) or more statements as false and defamatory, the correction may deal with some of such statements pursuant to (a) above and with other of such statements pursuant to (b) above.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> A “sufficient demand for correction” is a demand for correction which is in writing; which is signed by the plaintiff or his duly authorized attorney or agent; which specifies the statement or statements claimed to be false and defamatory, states wherein they are false, and sets forth the true facts; and which is delivered to the defendant prior to the commencement of the action.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> A “correction” is either (a) the publication of an acknowledgment that the statement or statements specified as false and defamatory in the plaintiff’s demand for correction are erroneous, or (b) the publication of the plaintiff’s statement of the true facts (as set forth in his demand for correction) or a fair summary thereof, exclusive of any portions thereof which are defamatory of another, obscene, or otherwise improper for publication. If the demand for correction has specified two (2) or more statements as false and defamatory, the correction may deal with some of such statements pursuant to (a) above and with other of such statements pursuant to (b) above.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> A “conspicuous publication” in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication which is broadcast at substantially the same time of day, and with the same sending power, as the statement or statements specified as false and defamatory in the demand for correction. A publication in a particular manner which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed “conspicuous.”</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> A “timely publication” in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication within one (1) business day after the day on which a sufficient demand for correction is received by the defendant. A “business day” is any day other than a Sunday or legal holiday. A publication on a particular day which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed “timely.”</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> “Special damages” are pecuniary damages which the plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered in respect to his property, business, trade, profession, or occupation (including such amounts of money as the plaintiff alleges and proves he has expended as a proximate result of the alleged defamation), and no other.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to such property as is owned and held for use, the criterion of damages for the loss of the use is the value of such use, but where the property is not owned and held by the owner for use but for sale, the value of the loss of possession, not being capable of estimation on a basis of its usable value, as it has no such value to the owner, is estimated on the basis of the deterioration or depreciation in its salable value caused by the attachment.

A period of three or four months would not be within the referenced time frame, but “on or about” a certain date could cover a period of several days; clearly, two days was within the span of several days, and thus, notice that an accident occurred “on or about” a particular date included a date two days subsequent thereto.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The damage provisions of the federal death on the high seas act, 46 USCS § 761, rather than this section, were found applicable in a wrongful death action resulting from an accident involving the collision on the Ohio River of a pleasure cruiser and a tow of 15 barges. In re American Commercial Lines, Inc., 366 F. Supp. 134, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11164 (E.D. Ky. 1973).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because Kentucky law did not recognize a claim by an adult parent for the loss of a minor’s consortium, or a claim by a minor child for the loss of a parent’s consortium, and limited both types of consortium claims to wrongful death actions, pursuant to KRS 411.135, the parent and child’s consortium claims were dismissed. Ferguson v. Aventis Pasteur, Inc., 444 F. Supp. 2d 755, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14425 (E.D. Ky. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action arising from an airplane crash, the airline company was entitled to dismissal of the survivors’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>claims for an award of loss of consortium to the parents of adult children; the plain language of KRS 411.135 restricted such claims to parents of minor children. Combs v. Comair, Inc. (In re Air Crash at Lexington, KY), 556 F. Supp. 2d 665, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1216 (E.D. Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action arising from an airplane crash, the airline company was entitled to dismissal of the survivors’ claims for an award of loss of consortium to adult children for the loss of their parents; in light of KRS 2.015, the federal court was not convinced that the Kentucky Supreme Court would recognize an adult child’s claim for loss of consortium of a parent under KRS 411.135. Combs v. Comair, Inc. (In re Air Crash at Lexington, KY), 556 F. Supp. 2d 665, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1216 (E.D. Ky. 2008).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By authorizing damages to the parents of a “minor” child for loss of affection and companionship that would have been derived from such child “during its minority,” the Kentucky legislature excluded an award of loss of consortium to the parents of an adult child; any other interpretation of KRS 411.135 renders the modifier “minor” and the words “during its minority” meaningless. Combs v. Comair, Inc. (In re Air Crash at Lexington, KY), 556 F. Supp. 2d 665, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1216 (E.D. Ky. 2008).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The parents of a deceased child have a claim under this section for loss of affection and companionship without regard to whether the personal representative of the decedent ever asserts a claim for wrongful death under KRS 411.130, and, indeed, without regard to whether a personal representative is ever appointed; therefore, the parents’ claim is separate and apart from that of the personal representative. Department of Education v. Blevins, 707 S.W.2d 782, 1986 Ky. LEXIS 257 (Ky. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the legislature recognized the individuality of children in this section by providing a loss of consortium claim to parents who lose a child, children have a common-law claim for loss of parental consortium. There is no legal distinction between the two (2) causes of action as both seek to redress wrongs which destroy the parent-child relationship. Giuliani v. Guiler, 951 S.W.2d 318, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 74 (Ky. 1997).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The waiver of sovereign immunity granted by the Board of Claims Act, KRS 44.070 to 44.160, does not exclude a parent’s claim for loss of affection and companionship of a minor child as created by this section. Department of Education v. Blevins, 707 S.W.2d 782, 1986 Ky. LEXIS 257 (Ky. 1986).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 411.145(2) which sets out the right of a spouse to recover damages for loss of consortium, is similar in wording to KRS 411.135, which sets out the right of a parent to recover damages for loss of affection and companionship resulting from the wrongful death of their child, and it follows that the two (2) statutes should be interpreted consistently; a wife’s loss of spousal consortium claim in the Kentucky Board of Claims arising from an injury to her husband caused by a malfunctioning pedestrian control device was barred by KRS 44.070(1), which precluded liability for collateral or dependent claims. City of Danville v. Goode, 122 S.W.3d 591, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 314 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a wrongful death action, a limited retrial was required because a jury verdict of zero awarded for a child’s power to earn money was inadequate. On retrial, the jury should also be informed of such sums as were previously awarded to the decedent’s estate for loss of affection and companionship, for pain and suffering from the time of the child’s injury until the child’s death, and for medical and funeral expenses. Turfway Park Racing Ass'n v. Griffin, 834 S.W.2d 667, 1992 Ky. LEXIS 83 (Ky. 1992).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court recognizes that there is measurable value to one’s life other than his or her earning capacity; however, this value is already recoverable in the recognized category of mental suffering, and there is no need to allow for the recoupment of hedonic damages as a separate category of loss.

Estate of Embry v. Geo Transp. of Ind., Inc., 478 F. Supp. 2d 914, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51250 (E.D. Ky. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mentally handicapped adult child of woman who was killed in an airplane crash was not entitled pursue a claim for loss of parental consortium; the language of KRS 411.135, in conjunction with KRS 2.015 setting the age of majority, was plain in restricting claims for loss of consortium to minor children. In re Air Crash at Lexington, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18374 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 10, 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Children’s claims for loss of parental consortium were dismissed because Kentucky law prohibited recovery for a minor’s loss of consortium claim if it was not accompanied by a wrongful death claim. Since KRS 411.135 provided a parent with a loss of consortium claim for the loss of a minor child only in wrongful death actions; the “reciprocal” of KRS 411.135 was also limited to wrongful death cases. Brown v. Mason &amp; Dixon Lines, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42062 (W.D. Ky. May 23, 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment for an employer and the driver of a work vehicle that struck a deceased grandchild just prior to her death was proper in an action by her grandparent guardian, seeking to recover for loss of consortium, as the clear language of KRS 411.135 included only certain particular classes of persons and excluded other unmentioned classes such as grandparents. Willis v. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro. Sewer Dist., 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 198 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2010), review denied, ordered not published, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 257 (Ky. Oct. 19, 2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the court did not expressly restrict a child’s claim for loss of parental consortium, the court did say that it was creating a reciprocal claim to the statute; however, there was no reciprocity interest in this case because Kentucky statutes do not recognize a parent’s claim for loss of consortium with their adult children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pauly v. Chang, 498 S.W.3d 394, 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 172 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Zero award of damages to parents of a minor child who drowned in a hotel pool required a new trial for the award of some amount for the parents’ loss as the parents testified regarding memories with the child, the emotional pain endured while the child lingered on life support following the drowning, and the loss suffered after the child’s death. While one parent shared fault with the hotel for the child’s drowning, that fault did not preclude recovery, but only required that any award be apportioned based on the percentage of fault.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the purposes of applying Mandy Jo’s law, KRS 411.137, 391.033, “abandon” means neglect and refusal to perform natural and legal obligations to care and support, withholding of parental care, presence, opportunity to display voluntary affection and neglect to lend support and maintenance; it means also the failure to fulfill responsibility of care, training and guidance during the child’s formative years.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a wife’s suit for damages against a third party arose before the enactment of this section which is nonretroactive, the question of recovery is governed by common law which was declared to be, in the case of Kotsiris v.

Under that analysis, the $60 million punitive award was grossly excessive; as such, it was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As there can be no punitive damages absent proximate cause, and KRS 413.241(1) provides that a dram shop’s sale of alcohol cannot be the proximate cause of any injury caused by an intoxicated tortfeasor, a trial court erred by awarding a passenger who was injured in auto accident punitive damages against a nightclub and its owner.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Supreme Court had not struck down the provision of KRS 411.184 that allowed punitive damages awards for fraud, and the Federal District Court could not predict that the Kentucky Supreme Court would strike down KRS 411.186(2)(c). Thus, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery; plaintiff was entitled to discover defendant’s financial condition, not so plaintiff could present evidence of that condition to the trier of fact, but so that plaintiff could determine whether there was any evidence that defendant’s alleged misconduct resulted in a profit that it would not otherwise have gained. Derby Fabricating v. Packing Material Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28765 (W.D. Ky. Nov. 18, 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant intentionally killed the decedent, where he was convicted of murder but his conviction was reversed, where defendant pled guilty to manslaughter to avoid a retrial, where plaintiff, the decedent’s father, filed a wrongful death suit against defendant, where the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the issue of liability and conducted a jury trial on the issue of damages, where the jury awarded $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $60 million in punitive damages, and where defendant challenged the propriety of the punitive damages award, the court held that the purpose of the punitive damage award was not to compensate the estate but to vindicate the state’s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence of conduct of the type in which defendant engaged. Under that analysis, the $60 million punitive award was grossly excessive; as such, it was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the punitive damages award was reduced to $30 million. Ragland v. Estate of Digiuro, 352 S.W.3d 908, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 201 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the District Court did not cite KRS 411.186 when calculating the amount of punitive damages awarded to the private plaintiffs in a nuisance action, the court explicitly considered two (2) of the statutory factors when it discussed the duration of defendants’ misconduct and their consistent refusal to stop fugitive dust from crossing their property lines. These references, taken in conjunction with the court’s other references to defendants’ conduct and the statute’s discretionary language, indicated that the court had applied the proper legal standard.

Both principals had a duty to supervise school personnel, including the two employees who were charged with maintenance of the schools’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>grounds, and, to the extent that those obligations gave rise to a duty that would subject the principals and the employees to liability for failure to maintain the property or warn of dangerous conditions, their liability was limited by § 411.190(3)-(4).

Ann. § 411.190(1)(c) was not limited to the enumerated activities, but was broad enough to include activities conducted by organized team sports, the league’s activities fell under the statutory definition of recreational purpose.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the surviving spouse alleged that a landowner, which owned and operated a park, failed to train its employees to handle medical emergencies and to develop and implement a safety plan for a state-controlled waterway, the landowner and its employees were entitled to summary judgment because the decedent used the owner’s park for free to access the waterway for kayaking and died outside of the park on private property. Furthermore, the conduct of the owner and its employees was not willful or malicious. Poore v. 21st Century Parks, Inc., 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 88 (Ky. Ct. App. July 31, 2020).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite the fact that the contract between the city and the community center purported to be a lease, it was clear from the language of the contract itself and the monetary arrangement between the city and the center that the document was essentially an employment contract pursuant to which the center was paid to manage and oversee the day-to-day operation of the facility; therefor, with regard to the question of ownership of the property, the city and center fell squarely within the provision of subdivision (1)(b) of this section, defining an owner as “a possessor of a fee interest” or one “in control of the premises.” Midwestern, Inc. v. Northern Kentucky Community Center, 736 S.W.2d 348, 1987 Ky. App. LEXIS 506 (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By adopting a broad definition of “owner” and including the provision “in control of the premises” in KRS 411.190(1)(b), the legislature intended to eliminate negligence liability, under the circumstances set forth in the statute, by removing the duty of care from individuals who have sufficient control to render them liable absent the statute’s application.

<p class="p8">(7/13/2004). Although 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, directed that this section be created as a new section of KRS Chapter 21, the statute has been codified in KRS Chapter 411 because it is clear from the subject matter of this statute, the structure of ch. 109, and the range created by ch. 109, secs. 21 to 27, that placement in KRS Chapter 411 was intended.

<p class="p8">(7/13/2004). In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, subsec. 4, “home inspector” is defined as “a person licensed in accordance with Sections 1 to 27 of this Act.” Because the home inspector licensure provisions in ch. 109 are confined to Sections 1 to 20, and Sections 21 to 27 set forth notice and opportunity to repair procedures that must be followed prior to bringing an action for damages against a home inspector, the reference to Sections 1 to 27 in subsection (4) has been changed by the Reviser of Statutes to the statutes at which Sections 1 to 20 are codified.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because transactions involving blood and blood components are considered services, as opposed to sales, they are outside the purview of this Commonwealth's Products Liability Act. McKee v. Miles Laboratories, Inc., 675 F. Supp. 1060, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12025 (E.D. Ky. 1987), aff'd, 866 F.2d 219, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 722 (6th Cir. Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Product Liability Act (PLA) codifies the idea that a manufacturer is not liable when the injuries result from the mutilation or alteration of the chattel since such intervening conduct severs any causal connection between the product and the injury precludes any imposition of liability on a manufacturer in cases where the product has not been used in its original, unaltered and unmodified condition. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 50 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a claim is brought against a seller or manufacturer of a product which is alleged to have caused injury then the Product Liability Act (PLA) applies, regardless of whether the action is founded on strict liability in tort, negligence, or breach of warranty. Thus while each of these theories of recovery in products liability cases requires proof of different elements and has different implications the central purpose is the same: recovery of damages for injury for property damage caused by a product. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 50 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Product’s Liability Act (PLA) does not attempt to abolish a right of recovery, be it jural or otherwise, but merely codifies long established Kentucky law that a manufacturer, under whatever legal theory, is not liable for injuries following the alteration, destruction, or mutilation of its product, or by its misuse which was not reasonably foreseeable. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 50 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Product Liability Act was inapplicable to an insurer’s subrogation claim against a fire alarm company seeking damages arising from a house fire because the contract between the insureds and the fire alarm company was not for the sale of goods, but was for services; while the fire alarm company agreed to supply the alarm system, title to the control set remained with the fire alarm company. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n v. ADT Sec. Servs., 241 S.W.3d 335, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 284 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Product liability action within the meaning of KRS 411.300(1), which was brought against manufacturers of generic versions of metoclopramide, was unsuccessful, in part because plaintiffs failed to convince the federal court that Kentucky state courts would adopt their vicarious-liability argument under the Kentucky Products Liability Act, KRS 411.300 to 411.340. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 657 F.3d 420, 2011 FED App. 0271P, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 19393 (6th Cir. Ky. 2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 974, 132 S. Ct. 2103, 182 L.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The undoubted intent of the Legislature in passing the Products Liability Act was to restrict liability; thus KRS 411.320(3) being clear and unambiguous, and its application according to its terms not yielding an absurd result, must be applied according to its plain meaning, and defendant’s motion for an instruction that contributory negligence is a complete bar in products liability action if supported by the evidence, must be granted.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court did not err when it did not provide a jury instruction setting forth the presumption embodied in KRS 411.310; once the plaintiff had offered proof of a defect, the presumption was no longer applicable.

Eversole v. Louisville Ladder Group, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 270 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 5, 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given that the presumption set forth at KRS 411.310(2) is only rebutted when plaintiffs show proof of a defect by a preponderance of the evidence, the presumption would appear to do nothing more than codify what the law has always been, and a plaintiff in a products liability action must still prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the product in question is defective.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Seller involved in a small claims action against the buyer, who sued it when the generator that the buyer purchased from the seller soon caught fire, could not show that a presumption of the Kentucky Products Liability Act (Act), contained in KRS 411.310(2), applied. Since a small claims action was involved, that Act did not apply and, indeed, the simplified small claims procedure set forth in statutes such as KRS 24A.200 and KRS 24A.300(2) governed such actions.

Further, the expert’s extensive knowledge, education, training, and professional experience qualified him as an expert. Boon Edam, Inc. v. Saunders, 324 S.W.3d 422, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 191 (Ky. Ct.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where rental center was not a seller and the product in question was not in the same condition as when originally manufactured, this section did not provide a defense and the question of the liability of the original manufacturer, if any, was simply irrelevant. Burke Enterprises, Inc. v. Mitchell, 700 S.W.2d 789, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 290 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant manufactured trailers incorporating suspension systems purchased from its supplier, the defendant could not escape liability under this section for a trailer with a defective suspension system.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because transactions involving blood and blood components are considered services, as opposed to sales, they are outside the purview of this Commonwealth's Products Liability Act.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court denied the gun distributor’s motion for summary judgment where the court found that the manufacturer failed to prove that it was entitled to protection under Kentucky law. Koby v. Star Ammunition, Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24310 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 19, 2001).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court rejected the consumers’ design defect claim against the retail store, finding that not only were the alleged defects open and obvious, but the sled contained a statement concerning the absence of a steering mechanism; so while a jury could have ultimately found that the sled was unreasonably dangerous, the consumers made no allegation that the retail store had any special knowledge to foresee such a danger. Weixler v. Paris Co., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 444 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 2, 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>motion to remand their product liability action to state court was granted because the non-diverse distributors of the dust respirators and masks at issue were not fraudulently joined; as the statutory language and Kentucky case law made clear, the defense of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 411.340 was not available under Kentucky law if there was a finding that the distributors “should have known” at the time of distribution or sale of a product that it was defective (whether the distributors had actual or constructive knowledge of any defects in the product was central to the merits of the case and was a question of fact to be resolved by a jury).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Baker v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court granted summary judgment as to a manufacturer on an accident victim’s strict liability and negligence claims based on defective design or manufacture, pursuant to KRS 411.340, because expert testimony indicated that the most likely cause of a spray paint can explosion was fatigue caused by impacts on the bottom of the can. However, the court found that there was a jury issue concerning the adequacy of the warning on the can. Coleman v. Rust-Oleum Corp., 405 F. Supp. 2d 806, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33265 (W.D. Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When plaintiff pled that the pharmacies knew or reasonably should have known that there was no indication warranting the long-term use of her prescribed medications and negligently failed to recognize the symptoms of her reaction to the medications, the allegations of negligence were inadequate to apply the second exception set forth in the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS 411.340, which applied when pharmacies knew or should have known at the time of sale that drugs were unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D. Ky. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regardless of whether plaintiff’s allegations of negligence against pharmacies were intended to state a claim that, by preparing a dosage of a prescribed drug and providing it over a long-term basis, the pharmacies altered the condition of the drugs, such a claim was not adequately stated in the complaint when plaintiff alleged only that the pharmacies filled plaintiff’s prescription as it was presented to the pharmacies from health care providers. Plaintiff did not sufficiently allege in her complaint that the pharmacies altered the condition of the drugs. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Retailer that sold a tree stand which allegedly broke and caused the purchaser to fall to his death was not entitled to summary judgment in a product liability case where a question remained as to whether the retailer created an express warranty under KRS 355.2-313 by advertising that it field-tested all of the products it sold before sending them to the customer; thus, a question remained as to whether the retailer was more than a mere seller for purposes of the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS 411.340.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the injured party, who suffered from a liver condition, became sick after eating raw oysters due to a bacteria commonly and naturally found in raw oysters, the restaurant owner was not entitled to summary judgment pursuant to RCr 56 in the injured party’s strict products liability action; KRS 411.340 did not bar strict liability against the restaurant owner, as a jury could have found that raw oysters unaccompanied by a manufacturer’s warning of the serious health risks to certain people were defective. Edwards v. Hop Sin, Inc., 140 S.W.3d 13, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 213 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lessor who purchased a scissor lift and leased it to a company was not liable to a company employee who was injured while using the lift because the lessor was immune from the employee’s strict liability and negligence claims for defective design under Kentucky’s Middleman Statute,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 411.340; the lift was not altered by the lessor, there was no allegation that the lessor breached an express warranty, and none of the employee’s evidence proved that the lessor knew or should have known of a design defect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both requirements of KRS 411.340 were satisfied where the manufacturer of the table at issue had been identified and was a party to the action, and all testimony indicated that no alterations were made to the table, and the table in fact was shipped directly to the contracting employer. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D. Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the product supplier was responsible under the terms of its agreement with the contracting employer for verifying that the product manufacturer made the contractor’s requested changes, then the supplier would not be immune under KRS 411.340. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D. Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reasonable jury could find that lift table supplier was responsible for ensuring compliance with the requested changes to the lift table, and if the resulting breach of an express warranty or the resulting sale of an unreasonably dangerous product caused injury, that would place the supplier outside the scope of KRS 411.340, which was designed to protect only those distributors, wholesalers, or retailers, who have no independent responsibility over the design or manufacture of a product. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D. Ky. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Kentucky Middleman Statute,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>KRS 411.340, did not render the distributors and retailers of the allegedly defective respirators “fraudulent” parties to the coal miner’s suit, the court held that remanding the case filed by a coal miner who claimed that certain respirators caused coal dust to enter his lungs, resulting in black lung disease, back to state court was the proper measure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29007 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 21, 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When plaintiff pled that the pharmacies had a duty to warn her of the effects of prescribed drugs but failed to allege that an express or implied warranty was made that the drugs were fit for her use, plaintiff could not utilize the first exception set out in the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS 411.340, for breach of an express warranty. Thus, plaintiff’s claims against the pharmacies were barred. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D. Ky. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff could not seek to recover against distributor under apparent manufacturer doctrine because Kentucky had not recognized that doctrine’s applicability to suits in the Commonwealth, and the court did not predict that a Kentucky court would do so if given the opportunity as it could not peacefully exist with Kentucky’s “middleman” statute, KRS 411.340. Rushing v. Flerlage Marine Co., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89009 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 27, 2010).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circumstantial evidence was not so strong as to overcome a presumption created by KRS 411.310(2) and 411.340 of the Kentucky Products Liability Act, KRS 411.300 to 411.340, that a spray paint can was not defective where the can, from a technical and performance standpoint, met industry and state of the art standards in design and manufacture. Further, the most likely cause of the explosion of the can was low cycle bending fatigue caused by impacts on the bottom of the can. Coleman v. Rust-Oleum Corp., 405 F. Supp. 2d 806, 2005 U.S. Dist.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “learned intermediary” doctrine did not abrogate the applicability of KRS 411.340 because that doctrine did not function as a rule to impose further liability on the defendant pharmacists but instead functioned as a protection for manufacturers of prescriptions drugs from liability for failure to warn a patient once the manufacturer provided an adequate warning to a prescribing physician; accordingly, because KRS 411.340 barred plaintiff’s claims against the non-diverse pharmacies, those claims did not ruin complete diversity against the remaining diverse drug manufacturer defendants for purposes of diversity jurisdiction under 28 USCS § 1332.

Fletcher v. Tenneco, Inc., 816 F. Supp. 1186, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21559 (E.D. Ky. 1993), op. withdrawn, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3054 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 22, 1993).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where no Kentucky caselaw considered the issue of whether private nuisance should be extended to allow recovery between subsequent landowners of the same parcel, the court held that, were a Kentucky court to consider the issue, it would follow the lead of the majority of the courts, which had consistently rejected allowing a subsequent landowner to recover in private nuisance from a prior landowner. Reg'l Airport Auth. v. LFG, LLC., 255 F. Supp. 2d 688, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5272 (W.D. Ky. 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the court believed that a Kentucky court would not recognize a cause of action in private nuisance between subsequent landowners of the same land, a regional airport authority was not entitled to relief in the form of damages for private nuisance against a previous property owner.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A regional airport authority could not use the theory of private nuisance under Kentucky law to attempt to recover the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination against the prior owner of the parcel of land. Reg'l Airport Auth. v. LFG, LLC, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11904 (W.D. Ky. June 19, 2003).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a regional airport authority (RAA) acquired real property as part of an airport project, then sued the prior landowner to recover the cost of cleaning up environmental contamination under a public nuisance theory, among other claims, although the RAA alleged the threatened and actual release of contaminants into the environment, it did not allege that such release occurred in a public place, or threatened the public in any way, and thus did not state a claim for public nuisance.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">If a surety pays any part of a debt or liability for which he is bound as surety, he may recover the amount, with interest from time of payment, from the principal by action at law or by motion, after ten (10) days’ notice in writing. He may also sue a cosurety, separately or as a joint defendant with the principal, in such proceeding, and in like manner recover judgment against him, separately or jointly, at the same time, for his proper part of the debt or liability so paid, as if the sureties were the sole obligors. If one (1) or more of several cosureties is insolvent, or resides out of the state, the recovery against the solvent and resident sureties shall also be for a proper part of the share of liability pertaining to the insolvent or nonresident surety. If the surety afterwards makes further payment on the debt or liability, he may again have like remedy therefor. But nothing in this section shall preclude the party sued from making any defense that might have been made against the original demand, unless the payment was made after and in consequence of a judgment in an action of which he had notice.</p>

<p class="p6">If the surety pays any part of a judgment he shall have a right to an assignment of the judgment from the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney, in whole or in part. When the plaintiff has been fully satisfied, the assignment shall give the surety the right to sue out or use any existing execution or otherwise control the judgment for his own benefit, against the other defendants, so far as to obtain satisfaction from the principal for the whole amount so paid by him, with interest, or from any cosurety his proper part of such payment, according to KRS 412.080. This assignment shall also transfer to the sureties so paying the benefit of any lien existing under or by virtue of the judgment, and the right of assignment shall exist, though the money was made or secured by sale of the property of the surety under execution.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations is intended to close the door of the courts to the bringing of suits on stale claims and is intended to be used as a blanket to smother any faint respiration of moribund claims of plaintiffs in regular causes of action or those of defendants asserted by counterclaim.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The repeal of a statute of limitation cannot act retrospectively so as to disturb rights acquired thereunder so the repeal of a provision in a city charter that a right of action against the city was barred by six-month limitation did not revive the right of action under the general statute of limitation. Lawrence v. Louisville, 96 Ky. 595, 29 S.W. 450, 16 Ky. L. Rptr. 672, 1895 Ky. LEXIS 131 (Ky. 1895).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is competent for the Legislature to change the period of limitations as to all claims not already barred and in doing so it may give the statute a retrospective effect provided that it does not impair the obligation of a contract or a vested right; yet it cannot remove a bar of limitation which has already become complete and no limitation shall be made affecting existing claims without allowing a reasonable time for parties to bring actions before their claims are absolutely barred by the new statute. Heath v. Hazelip, 159 Ky. 555, 167 S.W. 905, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 851 (Ky. 1914).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, by the enactment of a new statute, the period of limitation is shortened before a cause of action is barred, the reasonable time thereafter in which an action may be brought thereon is to be determined by the court in which it is instituted but in no event should it be extended beyond the length of time in which the action could have been brought under the old statute, nor to exceed the time allowed by the new statute. Heath v. Hazelip, 159 Ky. 555, 167 S.W. 905, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 851 (Ky. 1914).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a statute creates a new legal liability, with a right to a suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within a designated period, the time within which a suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created and not of the remedy alone. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Tafel Electric Co., 262 Ky. 792, 91 S.W.2d 42, 1935 Ky. LEXIS 798 (Ky. 1935).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations began to run against an infant, notwithstanding his infancy, at the death of his grandmother, at which time he was by law entitled to possession of the real estate, but under this section he had three (3) years after he arrived at full age within which to assert his claim to the land and the statute, having begun to run against the infant at the death of his grandmother, continued to run against his heir.

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> It is the declared policy of the Commonwealth to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land and silvicultural land for the production of food, timber, and other agricultural and silvicultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural and silvicultural areas, agricultural and silvicultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits or legal actions restricting agricultural or silvicultural operations. As a result, agricultural and silvicultural operations are sometimes either curtailed or forced to cease operations. Investments in farm and timber improvements may be discouraged. It is the purpose of this section to reduce the loss to the state of its agricultural and silvicultural resources by clarifying the circumstances under which agricultural and silvicultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance or interfered with by local ordinances or legal actions.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> No agricultural or silvicultural operation or any of its appurtenances shall be or become a nuisance or trespass, private or public, or be in violation of any zoning ordinance, or be subject to any ordinance that would restrict the right of the operator of the agricultural or silvicultural operation to utilize normal and accepted practices, by any changed conditions in or about the locality thereof after the same has been in operation for more than one (1) year, when the operation was not a nuisance at the time the operation began. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply whenever a nuisance, trespass, or zoning violation results from the negligent operation of an agricultural or silvicultural operation or its appurtenances.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3) (a)</b> For the purposes of this section, “agricultural operation” includes, but is not limited to, any facility for the production of crops, livestock, equine, poultry, livestock products, poultry products, horticultural products, and any generally accepted, reasonable, and prudent method for the operation of a farm to obtain a monetary profit that complies with applicable laws and administrative regulations, and is performed in a reasonable and prudent manner customary among farm operators. Agricultural practices protected by this section shall include, but not be limited to, fertilizer application, the application of pesticides or herbicides that have been approved by public authority, planting, cultivating, mowing, harvesting, land clearing, and constructing farm buildings, roads, lakes, and ponds associated with a farming operation.</p>

A silvicultural operation inherently includes lengthy periods between harvests and shall be deemed continuously operating so long as the property supports an actual or developing forest.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> An agricultural or silvicultural operation shall not lose its status by reason of a change of ownership or a cessation of operation of no more than five (5) years or one (1) year after the expiration of a state or national program contract, either in whole or in part, nor shall it lose its status by reason of changes of crops or methods of production due to the introduction and use of new and generally accepted technologies which allow the operator to continue an existing agricultural or silvicultural corporation, unless the operation is substantially changed.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> The provisions of this section shall not affect the right of any person, firm, or corporation to recover damages for any injuries or damages sustained by them on account of pollution of the waters of any stream or ground water of the person, firm, or corporation.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> Any and all ordinances of any unit of local government now in effect or hereafter adopted that would make an agricultural or silvicultural operation or its appurtenances a nuisance per se, or providing for abatement thereof as a nuisance, a trespass, or a zoning violation in the circumstance set forth in this section shall be void. However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent operation of any such agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the only apparent basis for this section is that a special class, builders, architects and engineers involved in construction, faced with a growing exposure to litigation, lobbied for a statute limiting their liability, and there is no social or economic basis presented to justify a special class, and other groups similarly situated do not share in their legislative windfall, this section is in fundamental conflict with the fifth clause of Ky.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff did not give the trial court the opportunity to gauge the constitutionality of this section in the light of Ky.

Derossett v. Burgher, 555 S.W.2d 579, 1977 Ky. LEXIS 510 (Ky. 1977).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section provides both a limitations period and a repose period; subdivision 1(e), read with the discovery rule contained in the first part of subsection 2, provides that an action must be brought against physicians, etc., within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, and that the cause of action accrues at the time the injury is first discovered, or with reasonable care should have been discovered. This is a statute of limitations, since it limits the time in which a plaintiff may bring suit after a cause of action accrues; the second part of subsection 2 provides that in no event shall a plaintiff commence an action more than five (5) years after the date on which the alleged negligent act was inflicted, and since it is possible that an injury and damages brought about by an allegedly negligent act may not be discovered within the five (5) years provided by this part of the statute, the cause of action would be destroyed before it legally existed; thus, this portion of the statute constitutes a statute of repose.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action against the parent of a minor, under KRS 186.590, for personal injuries arising from negligent operation of an automobile by the minor, is an action for personal injuries governed by the one (1) year period of limitations fixed by paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, and not an action upon a liability created by statute for which a five (5) year period of limitations is fixed by subsection (2) of KRS 413.120. The fact that a judgment has been obtained against the minor and that the judgment may be conclusive against the parent on the questions of negligence and damages makes no difference. Robinson v.

The converse of this is true also, and when a suit is for the sole benefit of the state although not brought in its name, the defense of the statute of limitations cannot be made; therefore, a suit brought against the department of welfare is barred by the statutes of limitation.

Thus, the tolling provision applied since it was established that the inmate had been of unsound mind since the attack at the jail forming the basis of the action. Green v. Floyd County, 803 F.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By this section, it was the evident purpose of the Legislature to provide against the contingency of one’s claim becoming barred by limitation when for some part of the statutory period there was no person in existence whom he had the legal right to sue, so, if four (4) years and six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months had passed at the time of the debtor’s death since the right to sue had accrued, and the law forbade a suit against his personal representative during the first six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months after his qualification, it must be manifest that the creditor would lose six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months of the five (5) years allotted to him by statute if he were not relieved by this section. Southern Contract Co.'s Assignee v. Newhouse, 119 Ky. 704, 66 S.W. 730, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 2141, 1902 Ky. LEXIS 175 (Ky. 1902). But see Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137 Ky. 437, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 587 (Ky. 1910).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not make the ancestor’s debt the heir’s but merely imposes on the property descended or devised the ancestor’s liabilities; therefore, when a debtor died, the statutory bar of five (5) years applied to his implied contract to pay back money prematurely distributed as dividends and no administrator was appointed for one (1) month after his death, and no action could, under the statute, be brought against the administrator for six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months after his appointment, the period of limitation was extended seven (7) months beyond the five (5) years. Southern Contract Co.'s Assignee v. Newhouse, 119 Ky. 704, 66 S.W. 730, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 2141, 1902 Ky. LEXIS 175 (Ky. 1902).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where decedent was entitled to bring action and he died before bringing the action and his personal representative qualified at least five (5) years before the expiration of the time limited for the commencement of the action, death of decedent did not suspend the running of the statute for a moment since the words in this section mean that if the personal representative does not bring his suit within the time allowed by the statute — in this case 15 years — he must bring it within one (1) year after he qualifies. Halcomb v. Cornett, 146 Ky. 339, 142 S.W. 686, 1912 Ky. LEXIS 69 (Ky. 1912).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section extends the statute of limitations only where the qualification of the personal representative was within one (1) year of the expiration of the statutory period and was clearly never intended to authorize parties by their own voluntary acts and conduct to suspend or interrupt the running; therefore, an action by a personal representative who did not qualify until 11 years after his decedent’s death and after statute of limitations had run on the note could not enforce payment of the note. Fix's Ex'r v. Cook, 192 Ky. 731, 234 S.W. 453, 1921 Ky. LEXIS 156 (Ky. 1921).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering KRS 413.120, this section, and KRS 395.270 together, in all causes of action falling under KRS 413.120, where the cause of action accrues during the life of the debtor and the debtor dies and an administrator is appointed for his estate more than one (1) year before the expiration of the time limit within which an action might be brought, this section has no application and does not stop the running of the statute during the first six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months after the administrator is appointed for the evident reason that as the creditor still has at least six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months in which to sue before the expiration of the time limit, the necessity for the passage of any remedial statute or enabling act is wanting. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137 Ky. 437, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 587 (Ky. 1910).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the debtor dies, and administration is granted on his estate less than one (1) year before the expiration of the time limit within which the suit must be brought, this section applies, provided the suit is commenced within one (1) year after administration is granted. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137 Ky. 437, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 587 (Ky. 1910).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is apparent that the Legislature only intended this section to apply to that class of cases where the debtor died and the administrator was appointed one (1) year or less before expiration of the time limit within which suit might be brought and there is good reason for such a rule, for, conceding that the creditor may not proceed against the administrator during the first six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>months after his qualification, he would still have six (6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>full months within which to sue.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where no administration is granted, this section applies in all cases where the death of the debtor occurs less than<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two (2) years before the expiration of the time limit, provided suit is commenced within<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two (2) years from the death of the debtor. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137 Ky. 437, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910 Ky. LEXIS 587 (Ky. 1910).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The extension of time given by this section to an administrator applies only to actions which existed in favor of the intestate and survived to the administrator and an action for the death from negligence of his intestate is not such a cause of action, since it never existed in the decedent and does not survive to his administrator but is conferred originally upon the administrator by KRS 411.130. Faulkner's Adm'r v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 184 Ky. 533, 212 S.W. 130, 1919 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1919), overruled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Conner v. George W.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>J died leaving property to his infant daughter. The property was sold to D who executed sale bond in favor of the daughter who died while still an infant. Mother was appointed administratrix of daughter’s estate. No administrator was appointed for J’s estate until shortly before suit. J’s heirs sued D on bond 16 years after daughter’s death, claiming proceeds under KRS 391.020. The court held that (1) statute of limitations was not extended by this section by reason of failure of personal representative of J’s estate to qualify, since right to collect bond was in personal representative of daughter and not personal representative of J, and (2) action was barred by KRS 413.090.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action was commenced by the filing in the proper court of a petition stating the cause of action, and by causing a summons to be issued or warning order to be made therein and where plaintiff filed his petition and procured the warning order within the prescribed time he had an action pending in court, and an attachment levied subsequently on defendant’s property was valid although the petition was amended at the time of the attachment and no new warning order or summons issued. Fremd v. Ireland, 33 S.W. 89, 17 Ky. L. Rptr. 1140 (1895). (See KRS 454.210.).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action is not commenced until a summons is issued or a warning order made thereon and, where plaintiff knew defendant was a nonresident, issuance of a summons that could not be served within the time prescribed by the statute of limitations was not sufficient to stop the running of the statute.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a summons, rather than a warning order, was issued in an action filed two (2) days after the defendant left the state, the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendant’s leaving was not alone sufficient to show that they knew that he was no longer a resident of the state and, therefore, in the absence of further proof, the issuance of summons was deemed to be in good faith. Appleton v. Southern Trust Co., 244 Ky. 453, 51 S.W.2d 447, 1932 Ky. LEXIS 452 (Ky. 1932). (See KRS 454.210.).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where action for wrongful death brought by nonresident administrator was not maintainable because administrator had no authority to sue in Kentucky, the filing of the action did not operate to suspend the running of the statute of limitations; therefore an attempt, after the statute had run, to substitute as plaintiff an ancillary administrator appointed in Kentucky, was too late.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The creation of, or annexation of, new territory to a town was a matter within the sole discretion of the Legislature, and did not in any manner depend upon the will of a majority or any inhabitants living within the territory. But if the Legislature did consult their wishes, as it well could, it acted for its advice and guidance, and not in deference to any legal right of the citizen. Cheaney v. Hooser, 48 Ky. 330, 1848 Ky. LEXIS 73 (Ky. 1848) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Legislature enacted a new charter for a town and provided that it should become effective only upon its acceptance by a majority of the legal voters of the town, it was determined by the court in a proceeding involving the constitutionality of the provision that the Legislature cannot delegate its powers to make laws; but, when enacted, whether or not the law shall become operative may be made to depend on the popular will of the inhabitants of the town. Clarke v. Rogers, 81 Ky. 43, 4 Ky. L. Rptr. 929, 1883 Ky. LEXIS 26 (Ky. 1883).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statute, under attack as being unconstitutional, enacted by the Legislature conferring upon Circuit Courts the right to establish towns in the state under certain conditions and providing that no appeal shall lie from the judgment of the lower courts, was held to be within, and not in violation of, Const., §§ 28 and 126, and the power conferred on the Circuit Courts was not legislative and not subject to appeal. Morton v. Woodford, 99 Ky. 367, 35 S.W. 1112, 18 Ky. L. Rptr. 271, 1896 Ky. LEXIS 91 (Ky. 1896).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature has the authority to grant to a city of the third class as part of its charter, provisions for the annexation of territory by ordinance, and such authority carries with it the right to annex another city, providing that the city so annexing the territory shall be bound for all debts and liabilities of the annexed municipal corporation. Pence v. Frankfort, 101 Ky. 534, 41 S.W. 1011, 19 Ky. L. Rptr. 721, 1897 Ky. LEXIS 224 (Ky. 1897).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The creation, enlargement and the dissolution of municipal corporations are exclusively legislative functions, and may be exercised alone by the legislative department of the government, and the act incorporating cities is not unconstitutional in those sections conferring upon the Circuit Courts a supervisory jurisdiction over the annexation of territory, at the suit of a citizen affected by such annexation, as conferring on the courts legislative functions. Lewis v. Brandenburg, 105 Ky. 14, 47 S.W. 862, 20 Ky. L. Rptr. 1011, 1898 Ky. LEXIS 238 (Ky. 1898).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A dissolution of an incorporated town that has been placed in its proper class by the Legislature can only be effected by the Legislature, so in an action to enjoin ineligible officers from acting, the fact that for many years the town had decreased in size, had not exercised the powers and rights granted to it by its charter and had failed to elect officers had not worked a dissolution. Hill v. Anderson, 122 Ky. 87, 90 S.W. 1071, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 1032, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 24 (Ky. 1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a petition seeking to restrain the appointed trustee from acting or alleging that none of the rights and powers granted to the town had been exercised for 17 years, the court determined that the action would not lie to restrain disqualified officers of a town from exercising the duties of their office since there was an adequate remedy at law providing penalty for usurpation of office. Hill v. Anderson, 122 Ky. 87, 90 S.W. 1071, 28 Ky. L. Rptr. 1032, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 24 (Ky. 1906).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A woman is a person and so is a corporation within the contemplation of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the federal Constitution, and a statute providing that a board of council of a city of the fourth class, by ordinance, may be complying with the statute, annex territory or reduce boundaries thereof, was not in violation of the Constitution of the United States by reason of the fact that some of the landholders affected might be women or corporations. Carrithers v. Shelbyville, 126 Ky. 769, 104 S.W. 744, 31 Ky. L. Rptr. 1166, 1907 Ky. LEXIS 92 (Ky. 1907).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a municipal corporation was organized in good faith, under a valid statute authorizing the incorporation, and has assumed the exercise of corporate powers, the judgment of incorporation is only subject to attack by the state in a direct proceeding to forfeit its franchise. Vanover v. Dunlap, 172 Ky. 679, 189 S.W. 915, 1916 Ky. LEXIS 255 (Ky. 1916).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The power to create or dissolve a municipal corporation belongs exclusively to the Legislature and cannot be delegated to or exercised by the judiciary; however, the general assembly may enact a general law for the creation or dissolution of a municipal corporation of the sixth class which is to take effect upon the happening of an event, or the existence of certain facts, and it may authorize a court to ascertain the event or the existence of the facts upon which the statute has application, and it will not thereby delegate to the court a legislative function.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The courts should be slow to invoke estoppel against the state in its efforts to enforce a statute the purpose of which is to prevent “conflict of interest” situations and to prevent self-interest in the deliberation of public servants.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the past the historical development of this section justified the conclusion that it was an exclusive course of procedure for removal of an official or a usurper and that concept should continue to prevail generally, but in the present case KRS 156.480 is clear and unequivocal that it the status or misconduct condemned is proven it automatically works a forfeiture of the incumbent school official’s right to the office. Arnett v. De Weese, 304 S.W.2d 784, 1957 Ky. LEXIS 281 (Ky. 1957).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The courts should not be deterred in giving a “conflict of interest” statute its full measure of legislative intendment by other public school authorities who may be instrumental in invoking the statute for purely selfish reasons.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section which is applicable to usurpers only does not apply to owners and thus it does not provide an exclusive remedy for revoking a ferry franchise. An action to revoke a ferry franchise because of continued nonresidence of the owner for more than one year is governed by KRS 280.180 (now repealed), 280.200, and 280.220. Crittenden County v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS, ch. 415 provides the exclusive mode for testing title to duly created city offices to which officers have been elected and only one claiming title to the office or the Attorney General may maintain an action to oust an alleged usurper.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not apply to an action by eight duly elected county magistrates to enjoin three persons elected commissioners at a void special election from interfering with their office, for the action was not an action to prevent usurpation of office since the title to magistrate was not in question. Patterson v. Lawson, 255 Ky. 781, 75 S.W.2d 507, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 330 (Ky. 1934).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If county road engineer is a usurper, then the way to remove him is that provided by this section and KRS 415.040 and not in a proceeding by the fiscal court to enjoin him from acting as county road engineer.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Abandonment of an office is quite different from forfeiture which may be adjudged only in a suit by the Commonwealth or a person entitled thereto under this section, and other board members may bring an action to determine if a member of county board of education has abandoned his office.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a certificate of election is conclusive of election of the one claiming the office in any collateral proceeding in which title to the office might be involved, it is not conclusive of the claimant’s eligibility when it is denied, in a direct proceeding against him involving his right to exercise the duties of the office, to prevent him from liability.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The acceptance and continuing to hold any office of trust or profit under the United States by an incumbent thereby vacates any civil office which he holds in Kentucky or to which he may be elected. But the one who seeks to recover it from another who is in possession of it, must show a right in himself before he can recover, and a certificate of election, or even a commission, is not prima facie evidence of eligibility to the office.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any justice of the peace that becomes disqualified by moving from his district would, if he refused to vacate his office by resignation, be subject to removal as a usurper by the Commonwealth’s Attorney. OAG 67-373.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A candidate for the office of constable who has not resided in the magisterial district long enough to become qualified for the office, would, if elected, become a usurper upon entering office and would be subject to ouster under the provisions of this section. OAG 69-316.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A candidate for the office of constable who, prior to the election, moved his legal residence outside of the magisterial district in which he was seeking office, no longer possessed the qualifications for office prescribed by Ky. Const., § 100, and if elected, would become a usurper upon taking office and would be subject to removal pursuant to this section. OAG 69-379.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A candidate for the office of coroner, who after being elected but before qualifying for office moved his legal residence from the magisterial district in which he was elected, would no longer possess the qualifications for office prescribed by Ky. Const., § 234 and, upon assuming office, would become a usurper subject to removal under this section. OAG 69-379.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Constables are required to live in the county from which they are elected pursuant to Ky. Const., §§ 99 and 100. If a person is elected constable and does not legally reside within the district from which he is elected, he would be subject to removal by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section. Once such person is removed, a vacancy is created which must be filled by the county court pursuant to KRS 63.220. OAG 70-157.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A convicted felon elected to a county office without having had his civil rights restored is subject to removal pursuant to this section. OAG 72-421.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a person is elected to the office of coroner without fulfilling the residence requirements, he would become a usurper subject to removal by the Commonwealth’s Attorney, but the failure to raise this question before his nomination in the primary precludes an opposing candidate or voter from questioning his qualifications thereafter. OAG 73-686.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a magistrate is required to reside within his district, his removal from the district would subject him to removal proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth’s Attorney upon his being presented with sufficient evidence of nonresidency and the grounds that he was a usurper which could be presented by any citizen. OAG 73-809.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a magistrate moves from and continues to live outside of the district in which he was elected he would be subject to an ouster action by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section. OAG 74-691.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A de facto member of the fiscal court and usurper of the office may be removed by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section since no other person is claiming his office and, as long as he occupies the office, this action would be necessary to remove him. OAG 75-26.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a county sheriff’s felony conviction is affirmed on appeal and the sheriff does not vacate the office, then the Commonwealth’s Attorney would have the duty to file an ouster action against him. OAG 76-232.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a candidate for the office of constable properly filed notification and declaration papers in the district in which he resided, but after the books closed, and prior to the primary, he moved to another district and was subsequently nominated in his old district, he is the nominee since his qualifications were not challenged prior to the primary; however, if he won election he could be removed as a usurper pursuant to this section or, if he voluntarily resigned his nomination, his party could select someone to fill his place on the ballot pursuant to subsection (3) of KRS 118.105. OAG 81-223.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although “courtesy special deputies,” who are unsalaried deputies who aid the sheriff in discharging his statutory duties, are illegal, an ouster action under this section would not be the appropriate legal remedy to their activities, since they do not pretend to hold a legal office. OAG 82-105.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the literal wording of this section, the responsibility for removing a convicted felon from a county office is the Commonwealth’s Attorney of the county; the removal becomes necessary where such officer has received no pardon in terms of Ky. Const., § 150. Thus, if a former felon is elected to public office without having his civil rights restored, such person may be removed as a usurper pursuant to this section; since the jailer is a county office, the burden of instituting an ouster suit squarely falls on the Commonwealth’s Attorney. OAG 83-393.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The position of executive director of the Office of the Ombudsman of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services is a “state office,” and one who holds that position is a “state officer,” such that one cannot hold that position and lawfully remain a member of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council. OAG 2006-02.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An ouster proceeding under this section and KRS 415.040 must be brought by one who is entitled to the office by the Commonwealth’s Attorney if a county office is at stake, or by the Attorney General if a state office is at stake. Williamson v. Hughes, 303 Ky. 735, 199 S.W.2d 125, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 540 (Ky. 1947).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In deciding whether the Attorney General has authority to bring ouster proceedings for usurpation of a public office, it is the governmental level of the office, rather than the nature of the usurpation for which ouster is sought which is controlling and since county school board members are state officers it is clear that usurpation of the office is to be attacked through actions brought by the Attorney General under this section. Commonwealth ex rel. Buckman v. Mason, 284 S.W.2d 825, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 53 (Ky. 1955).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Courts should be slow to invoke estoppel against the state in its efforts to enforce a statute the purpose of which is to prevent “conflict of interest” situations and to prevent self-interest in the deliberation of public servants, and fact that county school board member was re-elected to a new term after the acts complained of did not “whitewash” him or furnish a defense. Stringer v. Commonwealth, 428 S.W.2d 203, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 709 (Ky. 1968).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Courts should not be deterred in giving “conflict of interest” statute its full measure of legislative intendment by other public school authorities who may be instrumental in invoking the statute for purely selfish reasons.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the private citizen does not claim the office himself, the Attorney General is the only one who may institute an action for usurpation of offices other than county offices and franchises, and a private citizen may not compel the Attorney General by a writ of mandamus or otherwise to institute ouster proceedings, for the words “shall be” in this section simply provide, in essence, that if the right of action which rests in the Commonwealth is to be asserted in such a case, the Attorney General is the only one who may do so. Hermann v. Morlidge, 298 Ky. 632, 183 S.W.2d 807, 1944 Ky. LEXIS 968 (Ky. 1944).</p>
