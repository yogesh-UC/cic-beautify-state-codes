<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of mandating the prosecution of a case in the county in which the offense has been committed is to insure that the defendant is tried by an impartial jury from the vicinity in which the offense has been committed. Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 698 S.W.2d 832, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 280 (Ky. 1985).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Circuit Courts of this state are never without “jurisdiction” to preside over the prosecution of offenses committed in Kentucky; rather, this section stipulates that “venue” is improper in the Circuit Court of a county other than that in which the offense has been committed. Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 698 S.W.2d 832, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 280 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 452.510, venue in defendant’s criminal case could be changed from the first county, where venue was determined to be improper, to the second county where venue was proper, as defendant had a right under that statute to be tried where the offense was allegedly committed. Venue was not jurisdictional and no double jeopardy violation occurred regarding the conviction in the second county since the end of the trial in the first county was based on defendant’s own motion and defendant’s guilt in the first county had not been determined. Derry v. Commonwealth, 274 S.W.3d 439, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 316 (Ky. 2008).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prosecutions are confined to offenses committed within the county, and the indictment must describe the offense and state the time and place of its commission. Castle v. Commonwealth, 200 Ky. 577, 255 S.W. 151, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 147 (Ky. 1923).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In criminal prosecution, “vicinage,” as used in Const., § 11, means original venue in which offense charged, or part of it, was committed. Woosley v. Commonwealth, 293 S.W.2d 625, 1956 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 1956). See Byrd v. Commonwealth, 283 S.W.2d 191, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 290 (Ky. 1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue is a jurisdictional fact of locality charged in the indictment and put in issue by a plea of not guilty. Woosley v. Commonwealth, 293 S.W.2d 625, 1956 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 1956). See Sharp v. Waddill, 371 S.W.2d 14, 1963 Ky. LEXIS 85 (Ky. 1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s trial was not held in an improper venue because a reasonable jury could infer defendant intended to kill the victim in the county in which trial was held. Brown v. Commonwealth, 553 S.W.3d 826, 2018 Ky. LEXIS 283 (Ky. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless there has been a change of venue, a Circuit Court has no jurisdiction to try an offender unless the offense is proved to have been committed in the county where the court is held. Rounds v. Commonwealth, 282 Ky. 657, 139 S.W.2d 736, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 230 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue relates to the forum that will hear the particular action. Venue in criminal prosecutions may be changed if it appears that the accused may not receive a fair and impartial trial in the county where the crime was committed. The Circuit Court had no authority to change venue based upon the convenience of the parties. Wolfenbarger v. Commonwealth, 936 S.W.2d 770, 1996 Ky. App. LEXIS 100 (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pulaski Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the offense of feloniously breaking into a garage and taking a car even though the defendant had previously been indicted in Rockcastle County on a larceny charge involving the same automobile because the charges were of two (2) separate offenses and the breaking into the garage had occurred in Pulaski County. Runyon v. Morrow, 192 Ky. 785, 234 S.W. 304, 1921 Ky. LEXIS 141 (Ky. 1921).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is not necessary to show by direct evidence that the crime occurred in the county, as this may be inferred by facts and circumstances. Gilley v. Commonwealth, 280 Ky. 306, 133 S.W.2d 67, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 119 (Ky. 1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof that offense was committed within a few hundred yards of prosecutrix’ home, and that both prosecutrix and appellant lived in county where trial was had, was sufficient to fix venue. Gilley v. Commonwealth, 280 Ky. 306, 133 S.W.2d 67, 1939 Ky. LEXIS 119 (Ky. 1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In criminal cases it takes only slight evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to sustain the venue, since that does not affect the issue of guilt or innocence. Rounds v. Commonwealth, 282 Ky. 657, 139 S.W.2d 736, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 230 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue will not be presumed, though it may be inferred from circumstances which fairly and reasonably afford a basis for the inference. Rounds v. Commonwealth, 282 Ky. 657, 139 S.W.2d 736, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 230 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is necessary in every prosecution for crime that the venue be proved and that the jury find the offense to have been committed in the county as charged in the indictment. Lunce v. Commonwealth, 289 Ky. 706, 160 S.W.2d 3, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 622 (Ky. 1942).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s contention that evidence failed to prove homicide was committed in Leslie County was without merit, where witness placed crime within 11/2 miles of Hyden, since the Court of Appeals, having judicial knowledge of the geography of the state, would know that any place within 11/2 miles of Hyden was within the confines of Leslie County. Howard v. Commonwealth, 304 Ky. 149, 200 S.W.2d 148, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 601 (Ky. 1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue will be sustained by slight evidence and slight circumstances which would allow the jury to infer where the crime was committed. Vinson v. Commonwealth, 248 S.W.2d 430, 1952 Ky. LEXIS 746 (Ky. 1952).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue must be proved and although instructions submit it as one of the elements to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, slight evidence, supported by inferences and reasonable presumptions of knowledge by local jurors is sufficient to establish it. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 283 S.W.2d 191, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 290 (Ky. 1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the complaining witness testified that his cow was stolen from his farm near Foggertown in Clay County, there was sufficient proof that the property was taken within Clay County and venue in Clay Circuit Court was proper. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 283 S.W.2d 191, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 290 (Ky. 1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While proof is required to show that a crime was committed in an area within the jurisdiction of the court only slight evidence from which a jury may infer where the offense was committed is sufficient to sustain proof of venue. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 283 S.W.2d 191, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 290 (Ky. 1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venue must be proved, but since it does not affect the issue of guilt or innocence, slight evidence, supported by inferences and reasonable presumptions of knowledge by local jurors, is sufficient. Woosley v. Commonwealth, 293 S.W.2d 625, 1956 Ky. LEXIS 76 (Ky. 1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires proof by the prosecutor that the offense did in fact occur in the county in which the case is being prosecuted. It has generally been held in this state that it is not necessary to show by direct evidence that the crime occurred in the county of its prosecution, but the fact may be inferred from evidence and circumstances which would allow the jury to infer where the crime was committed. Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 698 S.W.2d 832, 1985 Ky. LEXIS 280 (Ky. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was an abundance of circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that the offense was committed in that county, the jury had a sufficient basis upon which they could infer that venue was established.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section it is necessary for the county clerk to issue an execution for costs taxed against a defendant upon conviction of a felony. OAG 65-535.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant must pay the cost for subpoenaing jurors in either quarterly or county court if he is convicted unless he proceeds in forma pauperis. OAG 65-732.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A sheriff cannot collect a fee for the service of a subpoena to appear before the grand jury because no one is liable for such a cost in a grand jury proceeding. OAG 65-842.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fines can be probated but not costs. OAG 66-225.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The complaining witness who swears out a warrant in a misdemeanor case is not responsible for paying the sheriff’s arresting fee. OAG 70-553.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sheriff’s arresting fee in a misdemeanor case is charged to the plaintiff Commonwealth but only to the extent that it can be collected from a convicted defendant. OAG 70-553.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a convicted felon has been probated under KRS 439.260 (now repealed), he is nevertheless legally charged with paying all costs that accrued in the prosecution and trial. OAG 72-8.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a bond is judicially forfeited, the commonwealth is not charged with such costs, pursuant to KRS 453.010, and the primary responsibility for such costs is upon the losing party and, the surety is liable for such fees and costs depending on his contracted liability. OAG 73-161.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor, all costs unpaid, including the tax on suits under KRS 142.011 (repealed), may be collected in the same manner as a fine which would include a capias issued by the court to compel the defendant to serve it out in jail and a writ of execution and, if the defendant is convicted of a felony, all costs shall be collected by a writ of execution unless the defendant is found by the sheriff to be execution proof or if the defendant has deposited money as bail under RCr 4.22 such money, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be applied to payment of such fine and costs. OAG 73-755, 73-782, 73-803, 73-814.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In considering whether a defendant is liable for any costs in a criminal action, regardless of other sections dealing with specific costs, this section provides he is responsible for no costs unless he is convicted. If defendant orders a transcript and is not convicted then no one pays since KRS 28.440 (repealed) contemplates the defendant’s paying only if convicted, otherwise if the county had to pay the fee for a pauper it could never recover against defendant since an acquitted defendant is not responsible for costs. OAG 73-811.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the payment of a fine may be suspended or probated when a person is found guilty, costs are not part of the penalty and the convicted defendant must pay the costs in order that the officers involved will get their pay for services rendered. OAG 74-75.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fourth-class city police court has authority to assess multiple costs against defendant convicted of multiple offenses as costs are taxed based upon each action, regardless of the joinder upon the statutory authorizations for costs accruing in each action or case. OAG 74-246.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant is found guilty in a police court in a fifth-class city upon a verdict or a plea of guilty, he must, pursuant to this section, pay the statutory court costs incurred, unless he is proceeding in a forma pauperis situation pursuant to KRS 453.190, regardless of whether he is fined or jailed or both or whether he is probated or placed under a peace bond since court costs are not part of the penalty imposed and a police court judge may not, pursuant to KRS 439.550, waive them. OAG 74-567.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The $2 fee charged by the sheriff for the collection of bail in either a misdemeanor or felony action must be collected from the defendant, if convicted, providing he is not proceeding as a pauper, and becomes a part of the judgment against the convicted defendant which, if unpaid, shall be collected by process as in civil cases. OAG 74-911.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The costs in a criminal case in Circuit Court or quarterly court for a bond required to be taken or prepared or recorded by the clerk or the court are to be computed at the termination of the suit and are collectible only if the defendant is convicted and not proceeding in forma pauperis and, while a record should be made at the time such services are performed the costs for such services are not collectible if the defendant is not subsequently convicted. OAG 75-24.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the imposition of court costs against criminal defendant is conditioned upon his conviction and upon his not proceeding in forma pauperis, a police court judge may not assess costs when the case or charge is filed away with leave to reopen. OAG 75-378.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutory fees earned by local officials in court actions must be taxed as costs and included in the judgment. OAG 78-249.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The party securing a warrant and failing to appear at trial is not liable for court costs. OAG 80-142.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there is nothing in the schedule suggesting that the fee for summoning a witness relates to civil cases only, the fee for serving a subpoena in criminal cases is $2 (now $10) under KRS 64.090; if the defendant is convicted, he is responsible for paying such cost unless he is permitted by the court to proceed in forma pauperis under KRS 453.190 and, if he is not convicted, then under KRS 64.340 and this section the fee cannot be collected.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The payment of the attorney’s fee by the clerk to the county law library is mandatory in those counties containing an urban county form of government; but such payment is not authorized for any other counties. In addition, a clerk has no authority to pay over the fee to the county law library, in counties not having an urban county form of government, at the request or direction of the fee attorney, since the powers of a public officer are limited to those conferred expressly by statute or which exist by a necessary and clear implication. OAG 82-544.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court clerks, in counties without an urban county form of government, in applying this section, are simply required to turn over the applicable attorney’s fee to the successful party’s attorney. The district clerks in such counties have no authority to turn the attorney’s fee over to the local county law library even when the winning attorney so directs; in such cases the winning attorney, after receiving his fee from the clerk, if he wishes, may himself turn over the fee to the county law library. OAG 82-544.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A juvenile court’s orders appointing attorneys as specific juveniles’ guardians ad litem and orders authorizing their payment in specific cases are confidential juvenile court records and as such are excluded from public view, however, a public agency’s records that a specific attorney was paid a sum certain out of public funds for his or her service in a specific court as a guardian ad litem are not; if the agency’s records include the names of the juveniles involved, making release of such information an invasion of the juveniles’ privacy, those names may be removed from the records before allowing access to the records. OAG 90-62.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cabinet records of a disbursement to an individual for discharging the duty of guardian ad litem in juvenile court are not juvenile court records as envisioned by KRS 610.340(1) (now KRS 610.340(1)(a)); rather, they are public records of a public expenditure made by a public agency to a person in consideration of a public service which was performed under the auspices of the juvenile court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section limits the award to $10,000 to each party.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s enhancement of one (1) plaintiff’s award by 2.5 times and the other plaintiffs’ award by 3 times was a clear abuse of discretion as there was no authority for this type of enhancement in Kentucky in a case brought by taxpayers against Revenue Cabinet over a tax on unmined coal.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Court of Appeals did not abuse its discretion when it decided that the position of the Revenue Cabinet was substantially justified or had a reasonable basis, under subdivision (2)(d) of this section, where the issues presented in the underlying case were arguably of first impression in this Commonwealth, and the position of the Revenue Cabinet was based on a substantial number of decisions from other jurisdictions and upon a reasonable belief that the extension of the principles in several other state decisions might be achieved.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiffs’ action was certified as a class action under CR 23.01 and, although different theories were asserted by different parties within the class, they sought the same relief — a declaration that KRS 132.020(5) was unconstitutional. Once the prerequisites of a class action were met and the class was certified, the claims of the representative were claims of the total class and all members of the class shared in the relief. Hence, the plaintiffs did not fail to prevail by a final adjudication on the merits. Revenue Cabinet v. Barbour, 836 S.W.2d 418, 1992 Ky. App. LEXIS 14 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the trial court entered its initial order awarding attorney’s fees, it reserved the determination of the actual amount until a later date, which was ultimately after the Supreme Court’s decision. It has been held that an order allowing an attorney’s fees, but not providing for a distribution of funds to the attorney, is not a “final order” from which an appeal will lie. Even though the initial order in the case at hand contained CR 54.02 finality language, the attorney fees issue was nevertheless interlocutory. Where an order is by its very nature interlocutory, even the inclusion of the recitals provided for in CR 54.02 will not make it appealable. Revenue Cabinet v. Barbour, 836 S.W.2d 418, 1992 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the judgment in an election contest proceeding was appealed to the Court of Appeals, and a motion was made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appeal bond was defective, whereupon the appellant tendered a new bond, it was held that this section had no application to an appeal bond given in an election contest. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 Ky. 49, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 Ky. L. Rptr. 977, 1904 Ky. LEXIS 144 (Ky. 1904).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the bond was not in double the sum of the damages claimed, in view of the provisions of this section, the court properly sustained the attachment inasmuch as the attachment was at most voidable and not void.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defective or insufficient bond is tendered or taken the court should, on motion of any interested party or on its own motion when the facts are brought to its attention, require a new and sufficient bond, and if the same is not made within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, the proceedings should be dismissed. Lee v. Phelps, 191 Ky. 219, 230 S.W. 44, 1921 Ky. LEXIS 304 (Ky. 1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the amount of attachment bond is required to be double the amount of the plaintiff’s claim, failure of the defendant to complain was held to waive the insufficiency, since under this section the bond could have been amended.

Hargis v. Pearce &amp; Son, 70 Ky. 234, 1870 Ky. LEXIS 39 (Ky. 1870) (decided under prior law).</p>

Slaughter v. Crouch, 64 S.W. 968, 23 Ky. L. Rptr. 1214, 1901 Ky. LEXIS 562 (Ky. Ct. App. 1901).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a state where the long-arm statute has been interpreted by its courts to be as broad as the limits of due process, the court merges the question of how far a state intended to extend its reach into the single question of whether the jurisdiction sought is within the requirements of due process.

The borrowers were loaned funds for real estate in Kentucky, which loan was secured by a mortgage lien on the Kentucky property and the borrowers’ payments on the loan were sent to the lender in West Virginia; thus all of these activities appeared to fall within the category of activity described in KRS 287.670(1) and personal jurisdiction was lacking over the borrowers’ state law breach of contract claim.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the inmate failed to attach documentation setting forth the grounds for three of the inmate’s four appeals, the inmate failed to establish that he had exhausted the administrative remedies as required by KRS 454.415(1). Houston v. Fletcher, 193 S.W.3d 276, 2006 Ky. App. LEXIS 147 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s motion to compel calculation of his sentence was properly denied by the trial court, as the inmate failed to follow the proper procedure under KRS 454.415 where he did not indicate that he filed an administrative complaint or appeal. Hensley v. Commonwealth, 355 S.W.3d 473, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 225 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 454.415(4), an inmate was required to have exhausted administrative remedies before filing an action in the trial court. Since the inmate had administrative remedies available regarding the inmate’s request for an award of retroactive meritorious good time credit and did not exhaust them, the trial court had no choice but to dismiss the inmate’s petition for a declaration of rights filed in the trial court regarding that request. Thrasher v. Commonwealth, 386 S.W.3d 132, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 244 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prison disciplinary proceeding, an appellate court refused to address certain issues because they were not raised in the proceedings below or before a circuit court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circuit court erred in dismissing an inmate's petition for declaration of rights on the ground that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies where the inmate wrote his reasons for appeal well in advance of the 15-day deadline set forth in Kentucky Correctional Policies and Procedures 15.6(II)(F)(3), the only evidence in the record substantiated his claim that he mailed the appeal to the warden within that window, and thus, a remand was necessary to determine whether the inmate could establish a right to relief under equitable tolling.
