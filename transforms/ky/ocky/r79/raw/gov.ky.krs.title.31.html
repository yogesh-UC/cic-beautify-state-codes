<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> Any person who performs labor or furnishes materials, for the erection, altering, or repairing of a house or other structure or for any fixture or machinery therein, for the excavation of cellars, cisterns, vaults, wells, or for the improvement in any manner of real property including the furnishing of agricultural lime, fertilizer, concrete pipe or drainage tile, crushed rock, gravel for roads or driveways, and materials used in the construction or maintenance of fences, by contract with, or by the written consent of, the owner, contractor, subcontractor, architect, or authorized agent, shall have a lien thereon, and upon the land upon which the improvements were made or on any interest the owner has therein, to secure the amount thereof with interest as provided in KRS 360.040 and costs. The lien on the land or improvements shall be superior to any mortgage or encumbrance created subsequent to the beginning of the labor or the furnishing of the materials, and the lien, if asserted as hereinafter provided, shall relate back and take effect from the time of the commencement of the labor or the furnishing of the materials. The lien shall not be for a greater amount in the aggregate than the contract price of the original contractor, and should the aggregate amount of the liens exceed the price agreed upon between the original contractor and the owner there shall be a pro rata distribution of the original contract price among the lienholders.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> The lien shall not take precedence over a mortgage or other contract lien or bona fide conveyance for value without notice, duly recorded or lodged for record according to law, unless the person claiming the prior lien shall, before the recording of the mortgage or other contract lien or conveyance, file in the office of the county clerk of the county wherein he has furnished or expects to furnish labor or materials, a statement showing that he has furnished or expects to furnish labor or materials, and the amount in full thereof. The lien shall not, as against the holder of a mortgage or other contract lien or conveyance, exceed the amount of the lien claimed or expected to be claimed as set forth in the statement. The statement shall, in other respects, be in the form prescribed by KRS 376.080.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> No person who has not contracted directly with the owner or his agent shall acquire a lien under this section unless he notifies in writing the owner of the property to be held liable or his authorized agent, within seventy-five (75) days on claims amounting to less than $1,000 and one hundred twenty (120) days on claims in excess of $1,000 after the last item of material or labor is furnished, of his intention to hold the property liable and the amount for which he will claim a lien. It shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was mailed to the last known address of the owner of the property upon which the lien is claimed, or to his duly authorized agent within the county in which the property to be held liable is located.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> No person who has not contracted directly with the owner or his authorized agent shall acquire a lien under this section on an owner-occupied single or double family dwelling, the appurtenances or additions thereto, or upon other improvements for agricultural or personal use to the real property or real property contiguous thereto and held by the same owner, upon which the owner-occupant’s dwelling is located, unless he notifies in writing the owner of the property to be held liable or his authorized agent not more than seventy-five (75) days after the last item of material or labor is furnished, of the delivery of the material or performance of labor and of his intention to hold the property liable and the amount for which he will claim a lien. It shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was mailed to the last known address of the owner of the property upon which the lien is claimed, or to his duly authorized agent. This notice is in lieu of the notice provided for in subsection (3). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the lien provided for under this section shall not be applicable to the extent that an owner-occupant of a single or double family dwelling or owner of other property as described in this subsection has, prior to receipt of the notice provided for in this subsection, paid the contractor, subcontractor, architect, or authorized agent for work performed or materials furnished prior to such payment. The contractor or subcontractor cannot be the authorized agent under this subsection.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A contractor clearly had a legal obligation to pay in full all claims for material and labor furnished on a residence out of the sum of $22,000 received on the contract from the owner, and if the amount paid by the owner was not sufficient to pay all such bills, then it was the contractor’s duty to pay all bills for material and labor on a pro rata basis.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If this section and KRS 376.990 (2) were construed to impose absolute criminal liability upon a contractor acting in good faith for a simple breach of contract, the statute probably would violate § 18 of the Kentucky Constitution which restricts imprisonment for debt and accordingly the statutes must be construed to require a culpable mental state before a contractor can be guilty of even a misdemeanor. Blanton v. Commonwealth, 562 S.W.2d 90, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 466 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section imposes an express trust upon contractors and misuse of funds from such trusts is actionable under 11 USCS § 523(a)(4). Fiduciary duties are imposed on a contractor under this section prior to and independent of any claim of misappropriation although a contractor may be held criminally liable for any misappropriation or defalcation which occur.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While this section imposes a duty upon a building contractor to apply payments from the property owner to the claims of the subcontractors and materialmen who have provided labor and materials, KRS 376.990 enforces that duty by imposing a criminal penalty in the event that a contractor fails to comply with those obligations. Accordingly KRS 376.990 converts this section into the nature of a criminal statute and any trust thereby created only arises upon the contractor’s misappropriation of funds. Riden v. Sigler (In re Sigler), 196 B.R. 762, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 671 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1996).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section requiring contractors to pay, in full, all materialmen from funds they receive from the owner, the property interest conferred upon the materialman is greater than the interest which may be secured by filing the statutory materialmen’s lien under KRS 376.210 and creates a trust for the materialman, wherein its claim of title transcends an attack by the trustee in bankruptcy, whether under a hypothetical lien creditor or a voidable preference theory, since the funds pass outside the bankrupt’s estate; thus, the materialman has an enforcible interest in the trust fund represented by checks jointly payable to the debtor and materialman creditor.

After the expiration of ten (10) days from the filing of the petition, the clerk of the court in which the petition was filed shall draw up an order referring the action to the master commissioner of the court and file it with the petition, deliver to the commissioner the pleadings and papers of the action, and make a memorandum thereof in his minute book.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> Any person who performs labor or furnishes materials, supplies, fixtures, machinery or other things of value to a lessee holding or owning a leasehold, or any right conferred by a lease, relating to oil, gas or other minerals, in the development or improvement of the leasehold, by contract with or by the written consent of the owner or the agent or representative of the owner of the leasehold, shall have a lien on the leasehold or the entire interest of the lessee including oil or gas wells, machinery and equipment, to secure the payment for the labor or things furnished. If the labor or things are furnished at the written request or by the written consent of any contractor or subcontractor, or the agent of either, the lien herein given shall be for the benefit of whoever may furnish any of the labor or things mentioned. The lien herein provided for shall be effective against the leasehold, or the entire interest of the lessee therein, including all improvements thereon belonging to the lessee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> If the lessee claims by executory contract, and if for any cause, the contract shall be rescinded or set aside, the lien provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall follow the leasehold into the hands of the person to whom the same may go, or with whom it may remain by reason of the rescission. If by the rescission the interest covered by the lease becomes vested in the lessor, the interest so covered by the lease shall be subject to said lien. If the lessee should be evicted from the possession of the leasehold by the judgment of a court, the lien shall nevertheless be effective against the leasehold and the improvements placed thereon by the lessee or those under whom he claims, while he or they were in possession thereof. If the lease expires or is forfeited, or the lessee in any other way loses his rights thereunder, the lien provided for shall nevertheless be effective against the leasehold, whoever may be the owner thereof, to the extent of the interest held by the lessee at the time the labor was performed or the things mentioned furnished, and this shall be true although the interest of the lessee may revert to the lessor. The lienholder may elect to remove any improvements from the premises if it can be done without material injury to any previous improvements on the leasehold, and when the election is made and improvement is removed the owner of the leasehold shall be given credit by the value of the improvements so removed and the lien-holder may enforce his lien to the extent of any balance remaining unpaid.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The provisions of KRS 376.010 and KRS 376.080 to 376.130 shall apply to the lien provided for in subsection (1) of this section. When necessary for the purposes of such application, “owner” shall be construed to mean “lessee” and “property” to mean “leasehold.”</p>

Accordingly this section converts KRS 376.070 into the nature of a criminal statute and any trust thereby created only arises upon the contractor’s misappropriation of funds. Riden v.
