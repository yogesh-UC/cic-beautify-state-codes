<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A registered voter who moves from one precinct in the county to another more than 30 days before the election but fails to notify the county clerk of his change of residence until after the registration books have closed cannot vote in his new precinct, although he may attempt to vote in his old precinct, assuming his name has not been purged and remains on the registration list when sent to the precinct.

<p class="p7"><b>(9)</b> An election officer shall be a qualified voter of the precinct; except that, where no qualified voter of the required political party is available within the precinct, the election officer shall be a qualified voter of the county. A minor seventeen (17) years of age who will become eighteen (18) years of age on or before the day of the regular election may serve as an election officer for the primary and regular elections in which he or she is qualified to vote; however, no precinct shall have more than one (1) person serving as an election officer who is a minor seventeen (17) years of age. An election officer shall not be a candidate for office during the election year. An election officer shall not be the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of a candidate who is to be voted for at the election in the precinct in which the election officer will serve on election day.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision in this section that the voter may make<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>application to the clerk in person or by mail for an absentee ballot can only<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>refer to the return of the application form, properly filled out by the voter,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the clerk for his absentee ballot, and could not be construed to refer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to obtaining the application form by the voter for future submission back<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the clerk for his absentee ballot.

The board may appoint a central ballot counting board of not less than three (3) members, who shall be qualified voters and no more than two-thirds (2/3) of whom shall be members of the same political party, to count the ballots at the direction of the county board of elections.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Beginning at 8 a.m. on election day, the board shall meet at the county clerk’s office to count the absentee ballots returned by mail and the ballots cast on the voting machine in the county clerk’s office or other place designated by the county board of elections and approved by the State Board of Elections.

The board shall open the boxes containing absentee ballots returned by mail and remove the envelopes one (1) at a time. As each envelope is removed, it shall be examined to ascertain whether the outer envelope and the detachable flap are in proper order and have been signed by the voter. A person having power of attorney for the voter and who signs the detachable flap and outer envelope for the voter shall complete the voter assistance form required by KRS 117.255. The signatures of two (2) witnesses are required if the voter signs the form with the use of a mark instead of the voter’s signature. All unsigned mail-in absentee ballots shall be rejected automatically. The chair of the county board of elections shall compare the signatures on the outer envelope, the detachable flap with the signature of the voter that appears on the registration card. If the outer envelope and the detachable flap are found to be in order, the chair shall read aloud the name of the voter. If the vote of the voter is not rejected on a challenge then made as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the chair shall remove the detachable flap and place the secrecy envelope unopened in a ballot box which has been provided for the purpose.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> When the name of a voter who cast a mail-in absentee ballot is read aloud by the chair, the vote of the voter may be challenged by any board member or by the written challenge provided in subsection (1) of this section and the challenge may be determined and the vote accepted or rejected by the board as if the voter was present and voting in person; but if the outer envelope and the detachable flap are regular, and each substantially comply with the provisions of this chapter, they shall be considered as showing that the voter is prima facie entitled to vote. If the vote of a voter is rejected pursuant to the challenge, the secrecy envelope shall not be opened, but returned to the outer envelope upon which the chair shall write on the envelope the word “rejected.”</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> After the challenges have been made and all the blank secrecy envelopes have been placed in a ballot box, the box shall be thoroughly shaken to redistribute the absentee ballots in the box.

<p class="p7">(7/15/2008). 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 129 eliminated the runoff primary in elections for Governor and Lieutenant Governor. In section 5 of that Act (this statute), a reference to “runoff primary” that was not deleted by the drafter has been deleted in codification as a manifest clerical or typographical error by the Reviser of Statutes.</p>

After this time period has elapsed and notice is taken, the county board of elections shall assemble at 9 a.m. on the Thursday following the filing deadline to request a recanvass, and not sooner, and recheck and recanvass each machine and make a proper return thereof to the county clerk, and the canvass and return shall become the official returns for the election. In making the recanvass, the board shall make a record of the number of the seal upon the voting machine and, without unlocking the machine against voting, recanvass the vote cast thereon. If, after a recanvass, it is found that the original canvass of the returns has been correctly made from the machine, and that there still remains a discrepancy unaccounted for, this discrepancy shall be noted. If, upon recanvass, it appears that the original canvass of the returns by the election officers was incorrect, the returns and all papers being prepared by the board shall be corrected accordingly. The county board of elections shall, immediately upon receipt of a request for a recanvass, notify each candidate for the office of the time and place of the recanvass. At the recanvass, each political party represented on the board may appoint a representative there to be its governing body, and also each candidate to be voted for may be present, either in person or by a representative or both. The county board of elections shall authorize representatives of the news media to observe the recanvass of the votes cast on the voting machine in each precinct. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an individual from requesting, in addition to a recanvass, a recount as authorized by KRS Chapter 120.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Each political party is entitled to have not exceeding two (2) challengers at each precinct during the holding of the primary election. Any group of bona fide candidates, as defined in KRS 118.176, of the same political party equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of all the candidates for that party to be voted for in a county in any primary, including state, district, and all other candidates, may recommend to the county committee or governing authority of the party for the county a list of persons whom they desire to have appointed as challengers in each precinct in the county. If more than two (2) such lists are furnished, the committee or governing authority, in making appointments of challengers, shall alternate between the several lists so furnished so as to give to each list an equal amount or proportion of the appointments, but in no event shall there be appointed more than one (1) challenger for any precinct from any one (1) list. The list of challengers shall be presented to the chair or secretary of the party committee of the county on or before the third Friday in April preceding the primary, and the committee or the chairman thereof shall make the appointments, certify to same, and present a list of certified challengers to the county clerk at least twenty (20) days before the date on which the primary is held. The appointment of challengers shall be certified in all respects as challengers at regular elections, except as otherwise provided in this section. The challengers shall be registered voters of the county in which the primary is held and shall be subject to the same penalties and possess the same rights and privileges as challengers at regular elections, except that the challengers of one political party shall not be entitled to challenge persons who offer to vote for candidates of any other party in the primary. The provisions of this section shall be enforceable against the chair of the political party committees by a mandatory summary proceeding instituted in the Circuit Court. The order of the court may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals as provided for the granting or dissolving of temporary injunctions.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Any school board candidate, any independent ticket or candidate for city office, any nonpartisan city candidate, or candidate for an office of the Court of Justice at the primary or regular election may designate not more than one (1) challenger to be present at and witness the holding of primaries or elections in each precinct in the county. A candidate who designates a challenger shall present the county clerk with the name of the challenger at least twenty (20) days preceding the primary or regular election. The challenger shall be entitled to stay in the room or at the door. The challenger shall be a registered voter of the county in which the primary or election is held, shall be appointed in writing by the chair of the committee, independent candidate, or candidates representing a ticket, and shall produce written appointment on demand of any election officer.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The county executive committee of any political party having a ticket to elect at any regular or special election may designate not more than two (2) challengers to be present at and witness the holding of the election in each precinct in the county. The challengers shall be entitled to stay in the room or at the door. The challengers shall be registered voters of the county in which the election is held, shall be appointed in writing signed by the chair of the committee, and shall produce written appointments on demand of any election officer. The committee or chair shall present the county clerk with a list of designated challengers at least twenty (20) days preceding a regular election and at least fifteen (15) days preceding a special election.</p>

If more than one (1) committee alleging itself to advocate or oppose the same amendment file such a petition, the county board of elections shall decide, and announce by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each committee not less than the third Tuesday preceding the election, which committee is entitled to nominate the challengers.

<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The committee shall file the names of the persons nominated by it with the clerk of the county at least twenty (20) days before the primary and regular elections and not less that fifteen (15) days preceding the date of a special election.

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section and in KRS 118.115, every political party shall nominate all of its candidates for elective offices to be voted for at any regular election at a primary held as provided in this chapter, and the governing authority of any political party shall have no power to nominate any candidate for any elective office or to provide any method of nominating candidates for any elective office other than by a primary as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Any political organization not constituting a political party as defined in KRS 118.015 may make its nominations as provided in KRS 118.325.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If a vacancy occurs in the nomination of an unopposed candidate or in a nomination made by the primary before the certification of candidates for the regular election made under KRS 118.215, because of death, disqualification to hold the office sought, or severe disabling condition which arose after the nomination, the governing authority of the party may provide for filling the vacancy, but only following certification to the governing authority, by the Secretary of State, that a vacancy exists for a reason specified in this subsection. When such a nomination has been made, the certificate of nomination shall be signed by the chair and secretary of the governing authority of the party making it, and shall be filed in the same manner as certificates of nomination at a primary.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If a vacancy occurs in the nomination of an unopposed candidate or in a nomination made by the primary before the certification of candidates for the regular election, and if that party’s nominee was the only political party candidate for the office sought, the governing authority of each party may nominate a candidate for the regular election, provided that no person has sought that party’s nomination by filing a notification and declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> If a vacancy occurs in the nomination of a candidate under the conditions of subsection (3) or (4) of this section prior to September 15 preceding the day of the regular election, certificates of nomination for replacement candidates shall be filed in the same manner as provided in subsections (3) and (4) not later than 4 p.m. ten (10) days after the vacancy occurs, excluding weekends and legal holidays. If a vacancy occurs in the nomination of a candidate under the conditions of subsection (3) or (4) of this section on or after September 15 preceding the date of the regular election, certificates of nomination for replacement candidates shall be filed in the same manner as provided in subsections (3) and (4) not later than 4 p.m. five (5) days after the vacancy occurs, excluding weekends and legal holidays.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If a vacancy in candidacy described in subsection (5) of this section occurs later than the second Thursday preceding the date of the regular election, no certificates of nomination shall be filed and any candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot may seek election by write-in voting pursuant to KRS 117.265.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> This section does not apply to candidates for members of boards of education, or presidential electors, nor to candidates participating in nonpartisan elections. However, regardless of the number of days served by a judge acting as a Senior Status Special Judge, a judge who elected to retire as a Senior Status Special Judge in accordance with KRS 21.580 shall not become a candidate for any elected office during the five (5) year term prescribed in KRS 21.580(1)(a)1.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The bona fides of any candidate seeking nomination or election in a primary or in a special or regular election may be questioned by any qualified voter entitled to vote for the candidate or by an opposing candidate by summary proceedings consisting of a motion before the Circuit Court of the judicial circuit in which the candidate whose bona fides is questioned resides. An action regarding the bona fides of any candidate seeking nomination or election in a primary or in a special or regular election may be commenced at any time prior to the regular election. The motion shall be tried summarily and without delay. Proof may be heard orally, and upon motion of either party shall be officially reported. If the Circuit Judge of the circuit in which the proceeding is filed is disqualified or absent from the county or is herself or himself a candidate, the proceeding may be presented to, heard and determined by the Circuit Judge of any adjoining judicial circuit.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> In any action or proceeding under this section the burden of proof as to the bona fides of a candidate shall be on the person challenging the bona fides of a candidate.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If the court finds the candidate is not a bona fide candidate it shall so order, and certify the fact to the board of elections, and the candidate’s name shall be stricken from the written designation of election officers filed with the board of elections or the court may refuse recognition or relief in a mandatory or injunctive way. The order of the Circuit Court shall be entered on the order book of the court and shall be subject to a motion to set aside in the Court of Appeals. The motion shall be heard by the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof in the manner provided for dissolving or granting injunctions, except that the motion shall be made before the court or judge within five (5) days after the entry of the order in the Circuit Court, and may be heard and tried upon the original papers, and the order of the Court of Appeals or judge thereof shall be final.</p>

No person whose registration status is as a registered member of a political party shall be eligible to election as an independent, or political organization, or political group candidate, nor shall any person be eligible to election as an independent, or political organization, or political group candidate whose registration status was as a registered member of a political party on January 1 immediately preceding the regular election for which the person seeks to be a candidate. This restriction shall not apply to candidates to those offices specified in KRS 118.105(7), for supervisor of a soil and water conservation district, for candidates for mayor or legislative body in cities of the home rule class, or to candidates participating in nonpartisan elections.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The form of the petition shall be prescribed by the State Board of Elections. It shall be signed by the candidate and by registered voters from the district or jurisdiction from which the candidate seeks nomination. The petition shall include a declaration, sworn to by the candidate, that he or she possesses all the constitutional and statutory requirements of the office for which the candidate has filed. Signatures for a petition of nomination for a candidate seeking any office, excluding President of the United States in accordance with KRS 118.591(1), shall not be affixed on the document to be filed prior to the first Wednesday after the first Monday in November of the year preceding the year in which the office will appear on the ballot. Signatures for nomination papers shall not be affixed on the document to be filed prior to the first Wednesday after the first Monday in November of the year preceding the year in which the office will appear on the ballot. A petition of nomination for a state officer, or any officer for whom all the electors of the state are entitled to vote, shall contain five thousand (5,000) petitioners; for a representative in Congress from any congressional district, or for any officer from any other district except as herein provided, four hundred (400) petitioners; for a county officer, member of the General Assembly, or Commonwealth’s attorney, one hundred (100) petitioners; for a soil and water conservation district supervisor, twenty-five (25) petitioners; for a city officer or board of education member, two (2) petitioners; and for an officer of a division less than a county, except as herein provided, twenty (20) petitioners. It shall not be necessary that the signatures of the petition be appended to one (1) paper. Each petitioner shall include the date he or she affixes the signature, address of residence, and date of birth. Failure of a voter to include the signature affixation date, date of birth, and address of residence shall result in the signature not being counted. If any person joins in nominating, by petition, more than one (1) nominee for any office to be filled, he or she shall be counted as a petitioner for the candidate whose petition is filed first, except a petitioner for the nomination of candidates for soil and water conservation district supervisors may be counted for every petition to which his or her signature is affixed.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> Titles, ranks, or spurious phrases shall not be accepted on the filing papers and shall not be printed on the ballots as part of the candidate’s name; however, nicknames, initials, and contractions of given names may be accepted as the candidate’s name.</p>

Any political party, as defined in KRS 118.015, and any political organization not constituting such a political party but whose candidate received two percent (2%) of the vote of the state at the last preceding election for presidential electors, may nominate, by a convention or primary held by the party or organization in accordance with its constitution and bylaws, as many electors of President and Vice President of the United States as this state is entitled to elect.</p>

The certificate shall be signed by the presiding officer and secretary of the convention, or by the chair and secretary of the county, city, or district committee, who shall add to their signatures their respective places of residence, and acknowledge the same before an officer duly authorized to administer oaths. A certificate of the acknowledgment shall be appended to the certificate of nomination.

The form of the statement shall be prescribed by the State Board of Elections. Such statement shall be filed as prescribed by KRS 118.365.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If the certificate of nomination of any state convention requests that the figure or device selected by such convention be used to designate the candidates of such party on the voting machines for all elections throughout the state, that figure or device shall be used until changed by request of a subsequent state convention of the same party. The device may be any appropriate symbol other than the coat of arms or seal of this state or of the United States, the national flag, or any other emblem common to the people at large.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> In case of death, resignation, or removal of any such candidate subsequent to nomination and before the certification of candidates for the regular election made under KRS 118.215, the chair of the state, county, or city district committee shall fill the vacancy, unless a supplemental certificate or petition of nomination is filed. In the case of electors of President and Vice President of the United States, a vacancy may be filled by the chair of the state committee at any time before the meeting of the electors, whether the vacancy occurs before or after the election.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If any political party entitled to nominate by convention fails to do so, the names of all nominees by petition for any office who are designated in their petition as members and candidates of that party shall be printed under the device and title on the voting machines as if nominated by a convention. If two (2) or more persons who have filed certificates of nomination under this section claim to be the nominee of the same political party, the governing authority of that party shall designate to the Secretary of State and county clerk, in writing, which of the candidates is entitled to the party emblem. If there are two (2) or more contending executive committees of the same party in the county or district, the county or district executive committee that is recognized by the state governing authority of the party, by the written certificate of its chair, shall be recognized by the Secretary of State and county clerk.</p>

<p class="p7">(2/12/2018). In subsection (2) of this statute, a reference to “KRS 118.215(1)(c)” has been changed to read “KRS 118.215(1)(b),” and a reference to “KRS 118.215(1)(d)” has been changed to read “KRS 118.215(1)(c).” When KRS 118.215 was amended in 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 129, sec. 8, the paragraphs in subsection (1) of that statute were renumbered, but this statute was not included in that Act to also conform the citations to the paragraphs of KRS 118.215(1) in this statute. The Reviser of Statutes has made the conforming change under the authority of KRS 7.135.</p>

In the case of candidates for offices for the state at large, the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court; in the case of other candidates it shall be filed in the Circuit Court of the county in which the contestee resides. The summons may be personally served on the contestee in any county, or it may be served by leaving a copy at his or her home with a member of his or her family over sixteen (16) years of age, or by posting a copy on the door of his or her residence. The contestee shall file his or her answer within seven (7) days after service of summons. The answer may contain grounds of contest in favor of the contestee and against the contestant, but the grounds shall be specifically set out. Any candidate who would have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a party to a recount proceeding brought under KRS 120.095, may, by filing an answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner in the recount proceeding. No ground of contest by either party shall be filed or made more definite by amendment after the expiration of the time allowed by this section for filing the original pleading. The contestant may file a reply within five (5) days after answer is filed, which shall complete the pleading, and any affirmative matter in the reply shall be treated as controverted. Upon return of the summons, properly executed, to the office of the circuit clerk of the county in which the action is pending, the clerk shall immediately docket the cause and notify the presiding judge of the court that the contest has been instituted, and the judge shall proceed to a trial of the cause within five (5) days after the issue was joined. In judicial circuits having more than one (1) Circuit Judge, the judge who shall hear the cause shall be determined by lot.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Any candidate voted for at a primary held under KRS 118.015 to 118.035 and 118.105 to 118.255 may request a recount of the ballots by filing a petition with the same court that contest petitions are required to be filed with, within ten (10) days after the day of the primary, or, if the candidate is qualified to bring a contest proceeding under KRS 120.055, by including a request for a recount in his or her petition instituting the contest proceedings. Any candidate who is a contestee in a contest proceeding under KRS 120.055 may request a recount in his or her answer filed in the contest proceeding, but in that case the answer shall be filed within five (5) days after the service of process on the petition. When a request for a recount is made, the State Board of Elections or the county board of elections, whichever would issue the certificate of nomination, shall be made a party defendant. The party requesting the recount shall execute a bond with approved surety for the costs of the recount, in an amount to be fixed by the Circuit Judge. Upon the bond being filed, the clerk shall immediately notify the Circuit Judge of the request and the filing of the bond, and the judge shall at once enter an order directing custody of the voting machines, the ballots, boxes, and all papers pertaining to the election to be transferred to the Circuit Court, and fix a day for the recount proceedings to begin. A copy of the order shall be served upon the parties or their counsel in the same manner as notices are required to be served, which shall be deemed sufficient notice of the proceeding. On the day fixed, the court shall proceed to recount the ballots if their integrity is satisfactorily shown and shall complete the recount as soon as practicable, and file and enter of record the results thereof, and direct the state board or county board, whichever would issue the certificate of nomination, to issue a certificate to the party entitled thereto as shown by the recount.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Any party may appeal from the judgment to the Court of Appeals, in the same manner as provided in KRS 120.075, all of the provisions of which statute shall be applicable.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If a proceeding for recount is asked and prosecuted in a contest proceeding, it shall not await the preparation or trial of the contest in the Circuit Court or in the Court of Appeals. The action of the courts shall be final, concluding the parties as to the question of a recount of the ballots, and certificates shall then be issued to the parties entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="p9">Any candidate for election to any state, county, district or city office (except the office of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, member of the General Assembly, and those city offices as to which there are other provisions made by law for determining contest elections), for whom a number of votes was cast equal to not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of votes cast for the successful candidate for the office, may contest the election of the successful candidate, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court of the county where the contestee resides, unless the officer is one (1) elected by the voters of the whole state, in which case the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court. The petition shall be filed and process issued within thirty (30) days after the day of election; it shall state the grounds of the contest relied on, and no other grounds shall afterwards be relied upon. The contestee shall file an answer within twenty (20) days after the service of summons upon him. The answer may consist of a denial of the averments of the petition and may also set up grounds of contest against the contestant; if grounds are so set up they shall be specifically pointed out and none other shall thereafter be relied upon by the party. Any candidate who would have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a party to a recount proceeding under KRS 120.185, may, by filing answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner in the recount proceeding. A reply may be filed within ten (10) days after the answer is filed; its affirmative allegations shall be treated as controverted, and no subsequent pleading shall be allowed.</p>
