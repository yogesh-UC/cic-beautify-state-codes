<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> The Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System, which is hereby adopted, means a system of plane coordinates which have been established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through its National Geodetic Survey, for defining and stating the geographic positions or locations of points on, within, or above the surface of the earth within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> For this system, the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth Office of Technology, under KRS 42.650 and advised by the Geographic Information Advisory Council, under KRS 42.740, shall establish and publish a series of layered zones covered by geodetically referenced mapping projections adopted and supported by the National Geodetic Survey as a component of the National Spatial Reference System. Each series of zones shall be identified by the geodetic datum upon which they are defined and each zone shall remain uniquely and consistently defined throughout its implementation within a particular series.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(3)</b> One (1) U.S. survey foot equals (1200)/(3937) meter. For conversion of meters to U. S. survey feet, multiply the meters by 3.28083333333 to twelve (12) significant figures. One (1) international foot equals 0.3048 meter exactly. For conversion of meters to international feet, multiply the meters by 3.280839895. Unless otherwise originally established for an existing series, the base unit of linear measure for defining all zones within each series of the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System shall be the meter. The specific constant for converting distances within each zone from the meter to the customary foot shall be:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> The U.S. survey foot conversion factor as originally and exclusively specified for any existing series; and</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The international foot conversion factor exclusively for each subsequent series established hereafter.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(4)</b> The plane coordinate values to be used for expressing the geographic position or location of a point in the appropriate zone of the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System shall consist of two (2) distances expressed in customary feet and decimals of a foot or meters and decimals of a meter. When the values are expressed in customary feet, the meter to foot conversion factor for the respective Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System series, as specified in subsection (3) of this section, shall be used. One (1) of the distances, to be known as the North y-coordinate, shall give the distance north of the X axis. The other, to be known as the “East x-coordinate,” shall give the distance east of the Y axis. The Y axis of any zone shall be parallel with the central meridian of that zone. The X axis of any zone shall be at right angles to the central meridian of that zone.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(5)</b> For purposes of describing the location of any survey station or land boundary corner in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it shall be considered a complete, legal, and satisfactory description of the location to give the position of the survey station or land boundary corner on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(6)</b> Nothing contained in this section shall require a purchaser or mortgagee of real property to rely wholly on a land description any part of which depends exclusively upon the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(7)</b> When any tract of land to be defined by a single description extends from one (1) into multiple mutually adjacent zones, the position of all points on its boundaries shall be referred exclusively to one (1) of the multiple zones. The zone which is used shall be named in the description.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(8)</b> No coordinates based on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System, purporting to define the position of a corner on a land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless the corner has been tied to a control monument or station established by conforming to the standards of accuracy for boundary surveying as specified by administrative regulations duly promulgated under KRS Chapter 322.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(9)</b> The use of the term “KENTUCKY STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM ” on any map, report of survey, or other document shall be limited to coordinates based on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System as defined in this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(10)</b> If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(11)</b> The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to prohibit the appropriate use of other geodetic reference networks.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The boundary of Kentucky is, for the most part, based on the original boundaries of Virginia, the state out of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>which Kentucky was carved. When Kentucky became a state in 1792 it was confined within the same limits as had bounded the western part of Virginia.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The colony of Virginia was settled<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>first in 1607, but the charter given it by the Crown was indefinite as to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the western boundary of the colony, virtually nothing being known about the land west of the mountains. Virginia, in November, 1783, created out of Orange County a new county to be known as Augusta County, whose boundaries included<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the present State of Kentucky. It was to embrace all territory northwest of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a line “to be run from the head spring of Hedgman River to the head spring of the river Potowmack.”</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Augusta County, Virginia, was divided<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in 1769, the western portion being known as Botetourt County; a few years<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>later Fincastle County was split off from Botetourt, to include all of Botetourt<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>County “within a line, to run up the east side of New River to the mouth of Culberson’s Creek, thence a direct line to the Catawba road, where it crosses<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the dividing ridge, between the north fork of Roanoke and the waters of New River, thence with the top of the ridge to the bent where it turns eastwardly, thence a south course, crossing Little River, to the top of the Blue Ridge of mountains.”</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The present eastern boundary of Kentucky corresponds roughly to that of Kentucky County, which was one of the three counties into which Fincastle was divided after Fincastle was abolished in 1776. Kentucky County lay south and west of a line running up the Big Sandy<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from the Ohio, and up the “northeasterly branch thereof to the Great<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Laurel Ridge or Cumberland Mountains”; then the line was to go along the mountains in a southwesterly direction until it struck the North Carolina line.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Virginia originally owned the territory north of the Ohio, as well as what is now the area of the State of Kentucky. In 1784, Virginia deeded to the Congress of the United States the land north and northwest of the Ohio River, retaining the rest. Courts have interpreted the cession to mean that the boundary of the land kept by Virginia was not the center of the Ohio, but the low water mark on the northern or northwestern<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>shores.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a result of the French and Indian War, Great Britain had acquired the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, the Treaty of Paris fixing the boundary line between<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spanish and British possessions as the middle of the Mississippi. The western boundary so established became <i>ipso facto</i> the boundary of Virginia, and, in 1783, was recognized by Great Britain as the western boundary of the United<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>States.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky entered the union in 1792, and, by virtue of an Act of the Virginia legislature of 1789, known as the “Compact with Virginia,” succeeded to the boundary theretofore delimiting the western part of Virginia.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The boundary here described is the result of a survey undertaken in 1799 and agreed to by commissioners appointed by the states of Kentucky and Virginia to ascertain the line. Their agreement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was approved by the legislatures of both states, and the line as described<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>therein was made the boundary.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When West Virginia separated from Virginia and became a state in 1863, it took over the Kentucky boundary that formerly delimited Virginia on the west, insofar as that old Virginia boundary was the boundary of the new state. The entire eastern boundary of Kentucky on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the one hand, and the two Virginias on the other, however, has not changed since 1799.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Act of approval contained a provision validating all land entries made in Virginia prior to October<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1, 1799 of lands lying in the forks of Sandy or east of the Cumberland Mountains<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on the waters of Sandy, and found by the survey to be in Kentucky. This provision<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has served its purpose and has been omitted.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 5 of 1986 Ky. Acts ch. 272 read, “KRS Title I, Chapter I, Boundary with Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, Acts 1942, c. 116, is repealed.”</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1784 deed of cession by Virginia applied only to land north and northwest of the Ohio River, and it has since been held that Kentucky jurisdiction extends to the low water mark on the north or northwestern shore. The part of the preceding description describing in detail a segment of the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky near Evansville was derived from an 1878 Act confirming the report of surveyors appointed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Kentucky and Indiana to run the true line between those states. The survey<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was made necessary by the fact that while in 1784 Green River Island in the Ohio River was within the Kentucky line, the river later changed its course,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the island became a part of the northern bank.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In 1896 the United States Supreme Court in the case of <i>Indiana v. Kentucky </i>,163 U.S. 520, 16 S. Ct. 1162, 41 L. Ed. 250 (1896) fixed the boundary line between the State of Indiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky between certain terminal points but neglected to fix points where such terminal points reached the low water mark on the right side of the Ohio River forming the remainder of the boundary line between the states. A dispute arose as to the boundary line connecting said terminal points with said low water mark. Pursuant to negotiations carried on between Indiana and Kentucky the following Act (1942, ch. 116) was enacted by the General Assembly:</p>
<p class="p6">“§ 1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That on and after the enactment of a similar and reciprocal law by the State<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Indiana and the approval and consent of the Congress of the United States of America to the compact thereby effected, the boundary line between the State of Indiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky shall be as follows, that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is to say:</p>
<p class="p6">“Commencing at a point on the line between Sections 15 and 14, Township 7 South, Range 10 West, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>67.25 chains South of the Northeast corner of Section 15, the same being the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>beginning point in the description of the part of the boundary line as fixed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Indiana v. Kentucky, decided<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May 18, 1896, and reported in 163 U.S. Reports; thence South 0°, 53´ 15" West to the low water mark on the right side of the Ohio River and thence upstream at low watermark on the right side of said River. Also beginning at the same beginning point to-wit: the beginning point in the description of the part of the boundary line between the State of Indiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky as fixed by the Supreme Court in the cases above recited and following that line to the end of so much of said boundary line as was fixed by said decree; thence due West to the low water mark on the right side of the Ohio River and thence downstream with said low water mark on the right side of said River.</p>
<p class="p6">“§ 2.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The above description comes from the report of commissioners who surveyed the entire Kentucky-Tennessee line in 1859 and 1860, and whose report was adopted by the General Assembly in 1860. This survey supersedes the old boundary as described in the Revised Statutes but was compiled for the first time in the 1944 Notes and Annotations to the Kentucky Revised Statutes.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The boundary described in all editions of the statutes from the Revised Statutes to Carroll’s Statutes, 1936 Edition, was that one which was run by commissioners Robert Trimble and John J. Crittenden, appointed by Kentucky, and Felix Grundy and William L. Brown, appointed by Tennessee, and which was ratified by Kentucky on February 11, 1820. The editor of Carroll’s Statutes stated in a note that for reasons unknown to him the boundary as run by the 1859-60 commissioners was omitted from the General Statutes, but he did not insert a description of the later boundary in his edition. He adds that he does not know wherein the two surveys differed.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The question of the differences between these two boundaries was discussed by Judge A.M.J. Cochran in <i>Hale &amp; Ward v. Cook</i>, (C.C.A. 1914) 213 F. 944. He, too, observed that compilations of Kentucky Statutes had contained only the earlier description of the boundary,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and opined that the reason for the omission of the later description was that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it was simply overlooked.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The older description declared the boundary from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi to be the line run by Alexander and Munsell in 1819, but contained no directions as to just where<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it should lie. For the most part, the line of Alexander and Munsell coincided with that of the 1859-60 commissioners, but one important difference must<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be noted. Alexander and Munsell had not run a straight, continuous line from the Tennessee to the Mississippi; a line run by them sixty-eight miles in a westerly direction from the Tennessee stopped just east of Reelfoot Lake,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and a line also run by them extended 274 poles east from the Mississippi, and then came to an end. The 1859-60 commissioners bridged the gap by joining<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>these two lines by a diagonal straight line, which they considered the state boundary.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The line between Virginia and North Carolina was declared in the charter of Charles II to be the parallel 36° 30´. A survey conducted in 1779 and 1780 to ascertain the exact location of the line resulted in Walker’s line, which ran from Cumberland Gap to the Tennessee River. In time, however, it was learned that in fact Walker’s line<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ran north of 36° 30´, though it continued to be used as the boundary.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Act of 1820, adopting the report of Crittenden, Trimble, Brown and Grundy, describes the line briefly, merely stating that it follows Walker’s line to the Tennessee River, and Alexander’s and Munsell’s from the Tennessee on. An act of November 22, 1821, adopts and ratifies a survey made in that year, by William Steele and Absalom Looney, of the Tennessee line to a point west of the Cumberland River; this survey goes into considerable detail, and has been used by all compilers up to, and including, Baldwin. For reasons not known, however, the Steele and Looney description was always printed as if it were part of the Act of 1820.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The true and accurate boundary between Kentucky and Tennessee, nevertheless, is that laid out by the commissioners of 1859-60 and adopted by the General Assembly of 1860 (ch. 816, § 1). That description was reproduced in the 1944 edition of Notes and Annotations to the Kentucky Revised Statutes, supplemented by a portion of section 190 of Carroll’s Statutes in regard to the Tennessee River as the boundary. It<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is again so reproduced in this edition. No attempt has been made to compare the boundary of Steele and Looney with that of the 1859-60 commissioners, because while the former employed geographical terms with which inhabitants of the neighborhood might be familiar, e.g. Hackle Knob, Bear Creek and Little South Fork, the latter used technical surveyors’ words of art. Should there be any conflict between the two descriptions, that of the 1859-60 commissioners would prevail.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The agreement of commissioners Trimble and Crittenden, of Kentucky, and commissioners Grundy and Brown, of Tennessee, which agreement was ratified by the General Assembly on February 11, 1820, contained one article providing a method of making future joint surveys of the boundary (Carroll’s Statutes, § 191), four articles relating to lands lying along the new boundary as they had run it (Carroll’s Statutes,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>§§ 192, 193, 194 and 195), one article providing that the agreement should be liberally construed to effect the objects contemplated (Carroll’s Statutes, § 196), and one article pledging the faith of Kentucky to enact future legislation necessary to carry the agreement into effect (Carroll’s Statutes, § 197). These articles do not have sufficient modern importance to justify their being set forth here at length, but a brief summary of their provisions follows:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 3 provided that whenever the governor of either state deems it expedient to have the boundary between the two states east of the Tennessee River, or any part thereof, run and plainly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>marked, he shall notify the governor of the other state and two surveyors shall then be appointed for that purpose, one by each governor. The surveyors<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are given power to employ necessary assistants, and are directed to survey<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and mark the line and submit duplicate plats and reports to the governor of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>each state, to be deposited and preserved in the office of the secretary of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>state. The expenses of the survey are to be borne equally by both states.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 4 declared void all claims to lands west of the Tennessee River and north of Alexander’s and Munsell’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>line that had been derived from North Carolina or Tennessee, and to lands<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>west of the river and south of that line, which had been derived from Virginia<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or Kentucky.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 5 provided that all lands vacant<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and unappropriated by any person claiming to hold under the states of North Carolina or Tennessee, as of February 11, 1820, and not thereafter appropriated, east of the Tennessee River, and north of the parallel of latitude 36° 30´ north, are the property and subject to the disposition, of the State<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Kentucky, and that any grant made by Kentucky after February 11, 1820,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of any part thereof, shall be received in evidence in the courts of Tennessee.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 6 stated that claims to lands east of the Tennessee River, between Walker’s line and 36° 30´ derived<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from Virginia in consideration of military service, should not be prejudiced by the establishment of Walker’s line as the boundary.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 7 validated titles between Walker’s line and 36° 30´ from the Cumberland River, near the mouth of Obey’s River, to the southeastern corner of Kentucky whether derived from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina or Tennessee. Kentucky and Tennessee reserved the power of carrying into grant, claims not then perfected; should there be any conflicting claims, the validity of each claim was to be tested by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the law of the state whence it emanated.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 8 provided that the agreement should be liberally construed, and that in case of a disagreement, two disinterested arbitrators should be selected to settle the dispute.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 9 pledged the faith of Kentucky and Tennessee that they will pass such further laws as might be necessary<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to effectuate the agreement.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The text of the original agreement can be found in the Acts of 1820 and in previous statute compilations.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alexander and Munsell, who surveyed the Kentucky-Tennessee boundary west of the Tennessee River in 1819, did not run a straight, continuous line from the Tennessee to the Mississippi River. They ran a line 68 miles west of the Tennessee, and then stopped; they also ran a line 274 poles east from the Mississippi, but no further. These two lines were joined in the survey of the Joint Boundary Commission of 1859-60. Otherwise, the line of the Commission conformed rather closely to the line of Alexander and Munsell.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The General Assembly finds that it is desirable that the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the United States exercise concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement over lands of the National Park System of the United States Department of the Interior lying within the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and to that end KRS 3.255 to 3.275 provides a mechanism for the adjustment of legislative jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">“Concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement,” as used in KRS 3.250 to 3.275, means the joint power of the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky to enact and enforce their own criminal laws, including those pertaining to motor vehicle traffic control, over the lands in question. Under concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement, both the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, or either of them, may take jurisdiction over a given criminal offense, according to the laws of the respective sovereign.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(1)</b> Whenever the United States shall desire to acquire concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement over any lands within this Commonwealth which the United States has or shall have acquired for purposes of the establishment or extension of a unit of the National Park System of the United States Department of the Interior and shall make application for that purpose, Kentucky cedes such measure of legislative jurisdiction, not exceeding that requested by the United States, as may be necessary to enable the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky to exercise concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement over such lands. The Governor is directed to negotiate with the United States, on behalf of the General Assembly, the administrative details of any such cession, which details shall be included in the instrument of cession.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(2)</b> Said application on behalf of the United States shall be accompanied by an accurate description of the lands over which such concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement is desired.</p>

In the event the Governor is of the opinion that the cession of legislative jurisdiction embodied in any proposed instrument of cession exceeds the measure of legislative jurisdiction necessary to enable the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky to exercise concurrent legislative jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law enforcement over the lands in question, he shall not sign the instrument of cession, and the cession shall not become effective until the General Assembly, at its next session, shall approve same.</p>
