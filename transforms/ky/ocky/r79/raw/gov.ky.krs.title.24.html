<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where three individuals built a private water line from their homes to a water main inside city limits and the city installed meters and charged the individuals the regular city rates and 19 others were allowed to tap into the line each paying the three (3) original builders $100 and signing a contract agreeing not to hold the original builders responsible for loss of service and to share the cost of maintenance the line was not a public utility within the regulation of the public service commission since it was not a distribution of water by the three (3) individuals for compensation. Austin v. Louisa, 264 S.W.2d 662, 1954 Ky. LEXIS 684 (Ky. 1954).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since sanitation districts are excluded from the provisions of this chapter and consequent Public Service Commission regulation, not only by omission, but by precise placement in another chapter of the KRS (KRS Chapter 220) a sanitation district is not a utility within the context of this chapter. Boone County Water &amp; Sewer Dist. v. PSC, 949 S.W.2d 588, 1997 Ky. LEXIS 61 (Ky. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the Public Service Commission (PSC) lacked jurisdiction to regulate the collection and transmission of sewage, it did not have jurisdiction over complaint by mobile home park that county water and sewer district violated KRS 278.160 requiring utilities to have a tariff on file in order to access a connection fee when it assessed a connection and inspection fee on each lot in the park for the collection and transmission of sewage by the district. While subsection (3) of this section sets the parameters of PSC jurisdiction and describes the movement of products and services it does not mention the movement of sewage but only mentions treatment in connection with sewage.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the city proposed to issue revenue bonds to construct a natural gas distribution and transmission system which it proposed to lease to a private party to operate and the private party had the power to adjust the rates under certain conditions, the private party was not an “operating facility” of the city and the facility does not fall under the exception from public service commission supervision or regulation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a city owned water supply system was not a utility subject to the jurisdiction of the public service commission, the commission was without jurisdiction to resolve a territorial dispute between a city and a private water company where the city undertook to extend its water supply system beyond city limits into a contiguous territory served by the private company.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The power of cities to contract with respect to utility rates does not deprive the state of its police power of regulation; but this power was not exercised before KRS 278.010 to 278.450 were enacted, and therefore contracts made before that date are valid. Union Light, Heat &amp; Power Co. v. Covington, 282 Ky. 558, 139 S.W.2d 64, 1940 Ky. LEXIS 208 (Ky. 1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Public Service Commission has jurisdiction over the utility companies, and that jurisdiction extends to their poles and the “services” and “rates” generated by pole attachment agreements with cable television companies; such use provides additional revenue to the utilities which must be considered in determining the “rates” it charges its customers for its basic utility services.

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after June 16, 1972, or, when requested in writing by a retail electric supplier and for good cause shown, such further time as the commission may fix by order, each retail electric supplier shall file with the commission a map or maps showing all of its existing distribution lines. The commission shall prepare or cause to be prepared within one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter a map or maps of uniform scale to show, accurately and clearly, the boundaries of the certified territory of each retail electric supplier as established under subsection (1) of this section, and shall issue such map or maps of certified territory to each retail electric supplier.

In the event that a new electric-consuming facility should locate in two (2) or more adjacent certified territories, the commission shall determine which retail electric supplier shall serve said facility based on criteria in KRS 278.017(3).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Except as provided in subsections (3) and (5) of this section, any new electric-consuming facility located in an area which has not as yet been included in a map issued by the commission, pursuant to KRS 278.017(2), or certified, pursuant to KRS 278.017(4), shall be furnished retail electric service by the retail electric supplier which has an existing distribution line in closer proximity to such electric-consuming facility than is the nearest existing distribution line of any other retail electric supplier. Any disputes under this subsection shall be resolved by the commission.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> The commission may, after a hearing had upon due notice, make such findings as may be supported by proof as to whether any retail electric supplier operating in a certified territory is rendering or proposes to render adequate service to an electric-consuming facility and in the event the commission finds that such retail electric supplier is not rendering or does not propose to render adequate service, the commission may enter an order specifying in what particulars such retail electric supplier has failed to render or propose to render adequate service and order that such failure be corrected within a reasonable time, such time to be fixed in such order. If the retail electric supplier so ordered to correct such failure fails to comply with such order, the commission may authorize another retail electric supplier to furnish retail electric service to such facility.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, no retail electric supplier shall furnish, make available, render or extend retail electric service to any electric-consuming facility to which such service is being lawfully furnished by another retail electric supplier on June 16, 1972, or to which retail electric service is lawfully commenced thereafter in accordance with this section by another retail electric supplier.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The provisions of KRS 278.016 to 278.020 shall not preclude any retail electric supplier from extending its service after June 16, 1972, to property and facilities owned and operated by said retail electric supplier.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> Notwithstanding the effectuation of certified territories established by or pursuant to KRS 278.016 to 278.020, and the exclusive right to service within such territory, a retail electric supplier may contract with another retail electric supplier for the purpose of allocating territories and consumers between such retail electric suppliers and designating which territories and consumers are to be served by which of said retail electric suppliers. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a contract between retail electric suppliers as herein provided when approved by the commission shall be valid and enforceable.

<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> For the purposes of this section, construction of any electric transmission line of one hundred thirty-eight (138) kilovolts or more and of more than five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet in length shall not be considered an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business and shall require a certificate of public convenience and necessity. However, ordinary extensions of existing systems in the usual course of business not requiring such a certificate shall include:</p>

The surety bond or guaranty shall be in an amount sufficient to ensure the full and faithful performance by the applicant or its successors of the obligations and requirements of this chapter and of all applicable federal and state environmental requirements.

Any acquisition of control without prior authorization shall be void and of no effect. As used in this subsection, the term “control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a utility, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by effecting a change in the composition of the board of directors, by contract or otherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if any individual or entity, directly or indirectly, owns ten percent (10%) or more of the voting securities of the utility. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that ownership does not in fact confer control. Application for any approval or authorization shall be made to the commission in writing, verified by oath or affirmation, and be in a form and contain the information as the commission requires. The commission shall approve any proposed acquisition when it finds that the same is to be made in accordance with law, for a proper purpose and is consistent with the public interest. The commission may make investigation and hold hearings in the matter as it deems necessary, and thereafter may grant any application under this subsection in whole or in part and with modification and upon terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate. The commission shall grant, modify, refuse, or prescribe appropriate terms and conditions with respect to every such application within sixty (60) days after the filing of the application therefor, unless it is necessary, for good cause shown, to continue the application for up to sixty (60) additional days.

The commission shall issue its decision no later than ninety (90) days after the application is filed, unless the commission extends this period, for good cause, to one hundred twenty (120) days. The commission may utilize the provisions of KRS 278.255(3) if, in the exercise of its discretion, it deems it necessary to hire a competent, qualified and independent firm to assist it in reaching its decision. The issuance by the commission of a certificate that public convenience and necessity require the construction of an electric transmission line shall be deemed to be a determination by the commission that, as of the date of issuance, the construction of the line is a prudent investment.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(10)</b> The commission shall not approve any application under subsection (6) or (7) of this section for the transfer of control of a utility described in KRS 278.010(3)(f) unless the commission finds, in addition to findings required by those subsections, that the person acquiring the utility has provided evidence of financial integrity to ensure the continuity of sewage service in the event that the acquirer cannot continue to provide service.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(11)</b> The commission shall not accept for filing an application requesting authority to abandon facilities that provide services as set forth in KRS 278.010(3)(f) or to cease providing services unless the applicant has provided written notice of the filing to the following:</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Whenever any utility files with the commission any schedule stating new rates, the commission may, upon its own motion, or upon complaint as provided in KRS 278.260, and upon reasonable notice, hold a hearing concerning the reasonableness of the new rates.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> Pending the hearing and the decision thereon, and after notice to the utility, the commission may, at any time before the schedule becomes effective, suspend the operation of the schedule and defer the use of the rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a longer period than five (5) months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect if an historical test period is used, or longer than six (6) months if a forward-looking test period is used, pursuant to KRS 278.192; and after such hearing, either completed before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the commission may make those orders with reference thereto as it deems proper in the matter. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made at the expiration of five (5) months, or six (6) months, as appropriate, the utility may place the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service in effect at the end of that period after notifying the commission, in writing, of its intention so to do. Where increased rates or charges are thus made effective, the commission may, by order, require the interested utility or utilities to maintain their records in a manner as will enable them, or the commission, or any of its customers, to determine the amounts to be refunded and to whom due in the event a refund is ordered, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may, by further order, require such utility or utilities to refund to the persons in whose behalf the amounts were paid that portion of the increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found unreasonable. Provided, however, if the commission, at any time, during the suspension period, finds that the company’s credit or operations will be materially impaired or damaged by the failure to permit the rates to become effective during the period, the commission may, after any hearing or hearings, permit all or a portion of the rates to become effective under terms and conditions as the commission may, by order, prescribe.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> At any hearing involving the rate or charge sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the utility, and the commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible, and in any event not later than ten (10) months after the filing of such schedules.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If the commission, by order, directs any utility to make a refund, as hereinabove provided, of all or any portion of the increased rates or charges, the utility shall make the refund within sixty (60) days after a final determination of the proceeding by an order of the court or commission with or without interest in the discretion of the commission. If the utility fails to make the refund within sixty (60) days after the final determination, any party entitled to a refund may, after ten (10) days’ written demand, bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction of this state, and may recover, in addition to the amount of the refund due, legal interest, court costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees. No such action may be maintained unless instituted within one (1) year after the final determination. Any number of persons entitled to refunds may join in as plaintiffs in a single action and the court shall render a judgment severally for each plaintiff as his interest may appear.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals of Kentucky agrees with the Kentucky Public Service Commission that the inclusion of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 154.27-020(2) in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 278.271 allows the Commission, at its option, to consider that one of the Commonwealth's goals is to offer incentives to induce the location of innovative energy-related businesses in the Commonwealth. The Court of Appeals also agrees with the Commission that an agreement for biomass energy does not have to be the least cost effective alternative to be deemed fair, just, and reasonable. Ky. Indus. Util. Customers, Inc. v. Ky. PSC, 504 S.W.3d 695, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 126 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that a contract is for the purchase of biomass energy does not make it, per se, reasonable. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 278.271 is clear that the Kentucky Public Service Commission must still assess the reasonableness of a proposed biomass agreement even if that agreement meets the goals of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 154.27-020(2). While the fact that an agreement meets the goals of § 154.27-020(2) is a factor the Commission may consider, it is not the determinative factor. Fairness, justness, and reasonableness remain the determinative considerations. Ky. Indus. Util. Customers, Inc. v. Ky. PSC, 504 S.W.3d 695, 2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 126 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court of Appeals of Kentucky believes that the General Assembly's intent was for Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 278.271 to inject another factor into the Kentucky Public Service Commission's reasonableness calculus when dealing with biomass energy. The Court of Appeals cannot accept that the General Assembly intended for the policy goals of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 154.27-020(2) to obviate the Commission's need to consider cost and necessity or to excuse a lack of evidence indicating that the agreement provides some benefit to the consumers that will ultimately bear its cost. Likewise, the Court of Appeals does not believe the statutes should be construed as standing for the proposition that all contracts with innovative energy-related businesses will necessarily have a net benefit to the public in terms of job creation and the expansion of the tax base.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The proper rate-making treatment for depreciation expense of contributed property of publicly held water districts is to allow depreciation on contributed plant as an operating expense; the fact that the utility did not make an investment in the plant is of no consequence in the context of publicly-owned facilities.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In setting rates for a public electric utility, the Public Service Commission was not required to base the rates on the value of only those assets of the utility which were “used and useful”; a determination of what is used and useful is only one (1) of many factors which should be considered when establishing rates. National-Southwire Aluminum Co. v. Big Rivers Electric Corp., 785 S.W.2d 503, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 9 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no clear reason from the definition of a co-op “system” in KRS 279.010 which requires an interpretation that the Public Service Commission must value only property used and useful in setting utility rates, especially with the concept that only that property which is fully utilized may be valued. National-Southwire Aluminum Co. v. Big Rivers Electric Corp., 785 S.W.2d 503, 1990 Ky. App. LEXIS 9 (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section appears to afford the Public Service Commission broad discretion in factors to be considered in ratemaking. It is certainly broad enough to consider such things as replacement cost, debt retirement, operating cost, and at least some excess capacity in order to insure continuation of adequate service during periods of high demand and some potential for growth and expansion. It also allows for consideration of whether expansion investments were prudently or imprudently made, and whether a particular utility is investor owned or a cooperative operation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although there is no specific statute requiring municipally owned utilities to refund service deposits, it would appear that such deposits must be refunded with interest under the general principle cited in Commonwealth v. Kentucky Power &amp; Light Co., 257 Ky. 66, 77 S.W.2d 395, 1934 Ky. LEXIS 522 (1934), provided it is not necessary to use the deposits to cover delinquent accounts at the time service is discontinued, and this would apply to deposits required by a city’s municipal utilities regardless of the length of time with which the person did business with the utility.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The making of a deposit by a customer of a municipal utility on which a fixed rate of interest must be paid creates a debtor and creditor relationship between the utility and the customer-depositor and in absence of an express provision restricting the utility’s use of the funds so deposited, the utility may use the money to suit its own convenience although the funds deposited take the form of a demand loan at all times. OAG 79-418.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requiring the public utility to pay interest on deposits required of patrons is not applicable to municipally owned utilities under the terms of KRS 278.010(3). OAG 79-418.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a municipal utility may require a reasonable and nondiscriminatory service deposit from its customers, it must pay interest on the deposit and must refund the deposit with interest when the customer ceases to be a patron of the utility, when so requested by the customer, provided it is not necessary to use the deposit to cover a delinquent account. OAG 79-418.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absent some specific provision in an agreement between the city’s utility plant board and its customers that security deposits shall be refunded to the customers prior to discontinuation of service, such deposits need not be refunded prior to discontinuation of service unless customers of the utility plant board can make other suitable arrangements about securing their bills. OAG 80-25.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the utility is permitted to require a deposit from its customers for its protection, it is manifestly clear that, for the time period the company holds that deposit, the customer must be compensated by way of interest, the deposit representing a debt. OAG 83-224.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section requires that six percent (6%) interest be paid annually, interest would be accrued on an annual basis in the event that this annual interest is not remitted to the customer, and assuming the deposit is kept longer than one (1) year, each yearly accrual of interest would become the property of the customer, in addition to the deposit, and a requirement would arise that interest accrued to that new debt as well as to the deposit itself so that compounding of interest would occur.

<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Each billing period, compensation provided to an eligible customer-generator shall be in the form of a dollar-denominated bill credit. If an eligible customer-generator’s bill credit exceeds the amount to be billed to the customer in a billing period, the amount of the credit in excess of the customer’s bill shall carry forward to the customer’s next bill. Excess bill credits shall not be transferable between customers or premises. If an eligible customer-generator closes his or her account, no cash refund for accumulated credits shall be paid.</p>

For any eligible customer-generator to whom this subsection applies, each net metering contract or tariff under which the customer takes service shall be identical, with respect to energy rates, rate structure, and monthly charges, to the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned if the customer were not an eligible customer-generator.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> Whenever any telephone company desires to connect its exchange or lines with the exchange or lines of another telephone company and the latter refuses to permit this to be done upon reasonable terms, rates and conditions, the company desiring the connection may proceed as provided in subsection (2) or as provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> The company desiring the connection may file a written statement with the Public Service Commission setting out the reasons why the connection is desired and the points at which the connection should be made, and giving the name and address of the owner or chief officer residing in this state of each company with which the connection is desired. The executive director of the commission shall thereupon cause a copy of the written statement to be served upon the companies owning or operating such lines or exchanges, by mailing a copy to the owner or chief officer residing in this state, and shall fix a date, not earlier than ten (10) days from the date of mailing the notice, for the hearing of the application. Upon the day so fixed for the hearing, the companies may respond in writing to the application, and either side may introduce such testimony as it desires and be heard by attorneys. After the hearing is completed the commission shall make its finding and enter it in a book to be kept for that purpose, and shall mail a copy thereof to each side; and if the commission directs the connection to be made it shall indicate the points where the connection is to be made, the number of wires to be connected, the terms and conditions and the rates to be charged, and the division of the rates charged between the companies handling the messages. The cost of making the connection shall be borne equally by the parties. If any company refuses to make a connection for a period of thirty (30) days after the finding of the commission directing the connection to be made, the company desiring the connection may make the connection and may recover one-half (1/2) of the cost thereof from the company so refusing.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> In lieu of the procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section, the company desiring the connection may compel the connection upon reasonable terms by suit in equity in the Franklin Circuit Court or in the Circuit Court of the county in which the company making the demand resides or has its chief office in this state, and the court shall, by mandatory injunction, compel the physical connection of the wires and interchange of messages, and enforce the same by contempt proceedings and in the same manner that other mandatory injunctions are enforced.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> “Telecommunications provider” or “provider” means a person that provides one (1) or more telecommunications services for compensation, and its successors in interest by way of acquisition or merger, and includes a provider of regulated and unregulated intrastate services offered to customers for the transmission of two-way, interactive communications. “Telecommunications provider” or “provider” does not include a provider of commercial mobile radio services as defined in 47 U.S.C. sec. 332(d)(1).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> “Letter of agency” means a written statement that authorizes a change of the customer’s telecommunications provider and bears the customer’s signature.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> A customer of a telecommunications provider shall not be switched to another provider without the customer’s letter of agency or the electronically recorded authorization of the customer, indicating that the customer knowingly approved the specific details of the switch. The requirement of a written or electronically recorded authorization shall not apply if the customer initiates a call to the customer’s local telephone service provider to request that his long-distance provider be changed. When a customer’s service is changed, the new provider shall maintain for one (1) year a record of nonpublic customer-specific information that establishes that the customer authorized the change. In any dispute, the burden of proof to show that the customer knowingly authorized the change shall be on the provider that claims to have obtained customer authorization for the switch.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If a letter of agency is combined with an inducement, or with information on a subject other than the change of a customer’s telecommunications provider, whether or not the letter of agency can be easily severed from the rest of the document, then the language whereby a person authorizes service from the provider shall be printed in a type size as large or larger than the largest type used in the document that includes the letter of agency.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> If a telecommunications provider initiates a switch of provider that the customer has not authorized under this section, that provider, upon request by the customer, shall reverse the change within five (5) business days.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The customer subjected to a change that is not verified consistent with this section or administrative regulations promulgated under this section is not responsible for any charges associated with the unauthorized change, including charges for usage subsequent to the change that are in excess of the amount the customer would have paid had the service not been changed, if the customer contacts the customer’s local exchange carrier, the customer’s previous provider of intrastate service, or the telecommunications provider that initiated an unauthorized change in service within one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt of the customer’s first bill containing charges by the telecommunications provider that initiated the unauthorized change. A telecommunications provider that has initiated an unauthorized customer change shall:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Pay all charges associated with returning the customer to the customer’s original telecommunications provider;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Upon request, provide all billing records to the original provider from which the customer was changed to enable the original provider to comply with this section.</p>
<p class="p10">The telecommunications provider that initiated the unauthorized change is responsible for any payment to access providers or to an underlying carrier where applicable. Failure of the customer to provide timely notice will relieve the telecommunications provider that initiated the unauthorized change of any obligations under this subsection.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> If the commission finds that a provider has willfully or repeatedly violated this section or an administrative regulation promulgated under it, the commission shall order the provider to take corrective action as necessary. The commission may impose a penalty on the violator as specified in KRS 278.990(1), except that the maximum civil penalty to be assessed for each violation of this section shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The commission also may, if consistent with the public interest, suspend, restrict, or revoke any certificate or registration of the telecommunications provider, thereby denying the provider the authorization to provide telecommunications service in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to KRS 278.650, a company building a cell tower was only required to apply for a certificate with the commission if it was seeking to build a tower outside the geographical jurisdiction of the local planning commission. Since the company was seeking to build the cell tower within the local planning commission’s geographical jurisdiction, the company could dismiss the application for certificate that it had filed before the commission and place it before the local planning unit having jurisdiction over the matter.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Local planning commission’s (LPC) failure to adopt regulations concerning the proposed construction or location of cellular towers was essentially a declination by the LPC to exercise the jurisdiction over such matters granted to it by KRS 100.987(1); thus, under KRS 278.650, the Kentucky Public Service Commission was the entity with jurisdiction to consider a company’s application for the construction of a cellular tower. Kentucky PSC v. Shadoan, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 382 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 100.987(1) affords a planning unit discretionary authority to regulate cellular tower construction within its political boundaries and this authority is triggered by the local adoption of regulations specific to the construction of cellular towers. This interpretation of the plainly permissive language of KRS 100.987(1) also harmonizes with the language of KRS 278.650 that envisions the possibility that under some circumstances, an application for a proposed cellular tower may fall outside the regulatory authority (i.e., “jurisdiction”) of a local planning commission. Kentucky PSC v. Shadoan, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 382 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Supreme Court reads the word “shall” in KRS 100.987(2), in requiring “every” applicant to submit a copy of the application to the planning commission of the affected planning unit, as demonstrating the Kentucky Legislature’s intent that jurisdiction over cellular tower siting and construction will always be in the local planning commission if the area in question has such a commission. Therefore, it was error to conclude that the Kentucky Public Service Commission had jurisdiction over the siting and construction of a proposed cellular antenna tower, even though a local planning commission had not enacted specific regulations pertaining to the construction of cellular towers.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kentucky Supreme Court reads the word “shall” in KRS 100.987(2), in requiring “every” applicant to submit a copy of the application to the planning commission of the affected planning unit, as demonstrating the Kentucky Legislature’s intent that jurisdiction over cellular tower siting and construction will always be in the local planning commission if the area in question has such a commission. Therefore, it was error to conclude that the Kentucky Public Service Commission had jurisdiction over the siting and construction of a proposed cellular antenna tower, even though a local planning commission had not enacted specific regulations pertaining to the construction of cellular towers.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A ferry is a public highway across a stream by boat instead of by bridge and is a public rather than a private right. Owner has no exclusive right to use of stream crossed by his ferry. He has same right to navigate stream that other citizens have and such right cannot be made subservient to that of riparian owners to maintain booms. The only damages owner of land on a navigable stream may recover for the condemnation of ferry landing is value of land appropriated and injury to residue of his land. Landowner cannot recover for damages to boom in navigable stream. Warner v. Ford Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 123 Ky. 103, 93 S.W. 650, 29 Ky. L. Rptr. 527, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 124 (Ky. 1906).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Granting a certificate of convenience and necessity to a third bus company with “closed door service” over a minor part of the route which was parallel and already served by protesting bus company was not abuse of discretion where evidence showed a presently existing bus service rendered by two different companies so that passengers had to change buses. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Taylor, 306 Ky. 767, 209 S.W.2d 330, 1948 Ky. LEXIS 655 (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If there was reasonable need apparent for the service under consideration and if another line would not be unduly interfered with and if the highway would not be unduly burdened, then there existed a case of convenience and necessity sufficient to justify the granting of a certificate.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “necessity” always had to be interpreted in its full relation to all circumstances of an existing situation and whatever promoted the general welfare, such as a direct and convenient bus line from remote communities to the state metropolis, and ordinarily had to carry some strong persuasion of its practical necessity.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding of director (now commissioner) that service being rendered was inadequate was not alone sufficient to establish right to a certificate.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bus line operating under certificates of convenience over a designated route had rights which were protected by law but its certificates authorizing the operation constituted a privilege bestowed by the state subject to its regulatory power and the bus line could have no legitimate complaint if a certificate was issued to another bus line under authority of the division (now department) and the decision of the division could not be disturbed by the court where there was substantial evidence showing a public convenience and necessity for the new service and the action taken was not arbitrary or capricious. Greyhound Corp. v. Steele, 237 S.W.2d 833, 1950 Ky. LEXIS 1105 (Ky. 1950) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where bus company had notice from the director (now commissioner) that its service was inadequate and it consistently failed, for longer than a reasonable time, to improve that service the director had authority to grant a certificate to competitor if public necessity and convenience so required and evidence amply supported the finding that both public convenience and necessity justified adding a new service on the route. Greyhound Corp. v. Steele, 237 S.W.2d 833, 1950 Ky. LEXIS 1105 (Ky. 1950) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to establish convenience and necessity for a new service or a new service facility it is necessary to first make a showing of a substantial inadequacy of existing service involving a consumer market sufficiently large to make it economically feasible for the new system or facility to be constructed and operated and second to show that the inadequacy is due either to substantial deficiency of service facilities beyond what could be supplied by normal improvements in the ordinary course of business, or to indifference, poor management or disregard of the rights of consumers, persisting over such a period of time as to establish an inability or unwillingness to render adequate service. Eck Miller Transfer Co. v. Armes, 269 S.W.2d 287, 1954 Ky. LEXIS 1004 (Ky. 1954).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining the question of convenience and necessity the court will apply the same principles to motor carrier utilities as to electric power utilities.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In ordinary circumstances it would be unduly burdensome for applicant for certificate of convenience and necessity to be required to prove, specifically, convenience and necessity for interchange service. Germann Bros. Motor Transp. Inc. v. Flora, 274 S.W.2d 797, 1954 Ky. LEXIS 1243 (Ky. 1954).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to render interchange service should be considered merely an incident of a certificate to render a common carrier service between designated points to the extent that the applicant should not be required, in the first instance, to prove convenience and necessity for the interchange service, however, if protestant makes an affirmative showing that the rendering of interchange service will adversely affect his interests, then the applicant may be required to produce some evidence to support a grant of the right to render such service. Germann Bros. Motor Transp. Inc. v. Flora, 274 S.W.2d 797, 1954 Ky. LEXIS 1243 (Ky. 1954).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In hearing on 1960 application for certificate where competing carrier’s service had been held adequate in 1957, doctrine of res judicata restricted evidence of 1957 and prior inadequacies to complete a picture of present inadequacy of service, but a finding of inadequacy cannot be predicated on what happened prior to 1957.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A city has the power to designate certain parking areas on the streets for the use of taxicabs. OAG 67-301.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When subsection (4) of this section is read together with KRS 281.680, it is rather clearly indicated that the city in which taxicabs are certified to operate has the power to fix rates for taxi service. OAG 72-352.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a town was not included among cities of first five (5) classes as classified in KRS 81.010, even if a taxicab operation was certified to operate in the town, such town could not exercise the powers concerning the supervision and regulation of taxicabs and prescribe qualifications concerning taxicab drivers certified to operate and thus the town did not have authority to grant a franchise for the operation of a taxicab business. OAG 75-153.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It would be inappropriate for the City of Louisville to give formal permission for persons to operate taxicabs in the city, as employes of taxicab companies, located in the city who do not possess a Kentucky chauffeur’s license as required by KRS 281.726 (now repealed), since the statute which authorizes cities of the first five classes to license taxicab drivers, subsection (5) of this section, expressly provides that any taxicab driver so licensed must also possess a Kentucky operator’s license.

<p class="p7">(7/15/2010). 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 93, sec. 3, provides: “Section 2 of this Act (this statute) shall apply retroactively, but shall not be construed to permit the prosecution of a person whose vehicle was inspected by a peace officer who did not, prior to the effective date of this Act (July 15, 2010), have the authority to perform inspections under KRS Chapter 281.”</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Warrantless searches of tractor-trailers are valid under the Burger doctrine as (1) commercial trucking is pervasively regulated pursuant to KRS 281.600, and (2) KRS 281.755 puts commercial drivers on notice that they are subject to inspections at any time or place to check for regulatory violations. Meghoo v. Commonwealth, 2004 Ky. App. LEXIS 316 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 29, 2004), aff'd, 245 S.W.3d 752, 2008 Ky. LEXIS 31 (Ky. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because KRS 281.755 was a constitutional statute permitting the warrantless administrative inspection of commercial vehicles, and because the police officer’s actions were objectively reasonable and were taken in good faith, defendant’s motion to suppress was denied; commercial trucking was a pervasively regulated industry, the substantial interests of the government in regulating the industry were evident, and KRS 281.755 placed adequate limits on the discretion of inspecting officers (adding a reasonable suspicion requirement for an administrative search was illogical, and the court declined to do so).

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of Attorney General.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a citation is given for violations under KRS chapter 281 by a representative of the bureau of vehicle regulation, this is not an arrest or a warrant and the issuing officer can write on the citation the specific court or judge having jurisdiction of the offense before whom the officer desires the person charged to appear. OAG 74-28.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a peace officer cannot arrest a driver for speeding in a school zone because the officer has not witnessed the commission of the misdemeanor offense, an arrest can be made with a warrant issued upon an affidavit of school personnel who witness the violation. OAG 76-313.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any officer originally commissioned under KRS 281.770, prior to the 1980 amendment thereto, and later transferred to the Bureau of State Police (now Department of State Police), has only that authority contained in KRS 281.770. OAG 82-298.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In regard to enforcement authority, KRS 281.770 and this section are in direct conflict and cannot be reconciled; the later and more specific statute, KRS 281.770, governs over this section, so that this section cannot be applied to special law enforcement officers commissioned under KRS 281.770. OAG 82-298.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Transportation Cabinet’s motor vehicle enforcement officers have both the power and duty to enforce those sections pertaining to driving a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants or impairing substances regarding all drivers of all motor vehicles, not just private and for-hire commercial vehicles or motor carrier drivers/operators. OAG 87-73.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The county judge/executive is not a sworn law enforcement officer in the sense of having police authority to enforce the traffic laws and further, the county judge/executive has no duty to purchase scales for use by the sheriff’s office in enforcing truck weight provisions; therefore a writ of mandamus probably will not lie against a county judge/executive to require him to purchase scales for a sheriff’s office use, as such is not his duty. OAG 92-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fiscal court, in determining whether to make an appropriation for purchase of scales to weigh trucks for use by the sheriff’s office, could weigh such need against funds available, reasonable enforcement priorities, availability of outside resources, and other considerations; a fiscal court is under a strict duty to ensure that essential obligations are provided for before making appropriations for those things that, while allowable, are not compulsory or indispensable. OAG 92-61.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sheriffs do not have the manpower to enforce all the laws of the Commonwealth in each county; at the same time, however, they have no general discretion to refrain from enforcement of certain laws, or to fail to take reasonable action in relation to a complaint regarding violation of a statutory provision; should a sheriff willfully refrain from enforcement of statutory provisions, he or she might be exposed to a claim of willful neglect of duty under KRS 61.170.

The cabinet shall inform an applicant, based upon the criminal history background check, of the applicant’s eligibility to be issued a CDL instruction permit or CDL.
