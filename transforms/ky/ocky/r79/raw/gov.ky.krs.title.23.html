The one owner was not protected by KRS 271B.14-050 since the one owner’s conduct did not involve winding up the business and even though the one owner would normally be shielded from personal liability as a shareholder, the one owner was not so protected by KRS 271B.6-220(2) because the administratively dissolved corporation had been dissolved by the time the one owner entered into the agreement.

The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS 271B.16-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest shall be treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although KRS 271B.8-300(3), regarding director liability, was relevant to determine the standard of care which the bank’s directors were obligated to exercise, the bank was not entitled to use that statute offensively to support a separate cause of action against its auditors. Indeed, even the bank cited no authority for the proposition that it could do so. Peoples Bank of N. Ky., Inc. v. Crowe Chizek &amp; Co. LLC, 277 S.W.3d 255, 2008 Ky. App. LEXIS 176 (Ky. Ct.

The directors allegedly acted to preserve their employment in the corporation; actions that could be classified as having been taken as a director or officer. Gundaker/Jordan Am. Holdings, Inc. v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there was no mandatory or persuasive authority from Kentucky courts classifying a breach of fiduciary duty as a personal injury, the court declined to construe it as such.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 271B.8-300 does not abrogate common law fiduciary duty claims against directors in Kentucky but essentially codifies a standard of conduct and standard of liability for directors that is derived from business judgment rule principles.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a director is acting on his own accord in anticipation of competing with the corporation which he still serves, that conduct implicates the director’s common law fiduciary duties, not KRS 271B.8-300.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>KRS 271B.8-300 simply does not speak to all actions an individual takes while serving as a corporate director but only to those which he or she takes or fails to take while acting in a directorial role, i.e., actions or inactions regarding corporate governance and the affairs of the corporation. For claims alleging breach of a director’s fiduciary duties, especially the duty of loyalty, in the context of preparation for and participation in a competing enterprise, the common law principles elucidated in case law continue to apply.

The Kentucky Legislature has merely meticulously set forth the claims and remedies available under common law, and the change in the burden of proof does not indicate an intent to abrogate the common-law claim entirely; rather, it merely increases the burden of proof. New Lexington Clinic, P.S.C. v. Cooper, 2011 Ky. App. LEXIS 245 (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1000 (Ky. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2011).</p>

Engdahl, 507 S.W.2d 166, 1974 Ky.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In setting “fair value” pursuant to KRS 271B.13-010, the trial court erred in applying a 20 percent marketability discount, absent exceptional circumstances, which made it possible for majority shareholders to squeeze-out a minority shareholder at a price considerably less than the minority shareholder’s proportionate interest in the closely-held family corporation as a whole.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In appraising a dissenter’s shares pursuant to KRS 271B.13-300 following a cash-out merger, a marketability discount was inappropriate at the shareholder level in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3), and and use of the Delaware block appraisal method was not necessary. Net asset value could be considered on remand, and an entity-level discount would be permissible. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011)(Overruling to the extent inconsistent: Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 251 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982), overruled in part, Brooks v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a hypothetical market price for the dissenter’s particular shares as a commodity is not the value being sought in an appraisal proceeding under KRS 271B.13-300, market adjustments to arrive at such a price, such as discounts for lack of control or lack of marketability, are inappropriate in determining fair value as defined in KRS 271B.13-010(3). The dissenting shareholder is entitled to the fair value of his or her shares as measured by the proportionate interest those shares represent in the value of the company as a going concern, a value determined in accord with generally accepted valuation concepts and techniques, as to which the Delaware block approach is not required.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Husband and wife who owned and operated a Kentucky oil and gas drilling company were ordered to pay investors $5,662,662 in compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest because they committed fraud, breach of contract, and conversion when they made misrepresentations that induced an elderly investor, members of his family, and family trusts to invest in nonexistent and worthless gas wells, and the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523. The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS 271B.16-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

<p class="p7">(7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, both effective 7/15/2010. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together. Effective 1/1/2011, this section was also repealed and reenacted by the omnibus Kentucky Business Entity Act, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151.</p>

Within twenty (20) days after the date on which the vote was taken, such member may, unless he votes in favor of the proposal, make written demand on the association for payment of the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interest in the association. Such demands shall state the number and class of shares of stock owned by him or the nature and amount of other property rights or interest owned by him in the association. In addition to any other right he may have in law or equity, a member giving such notice shall be entitled, if and when the merger or consolidation is effected, to be paid by the surviving association, or new association, the fair market value of such stock, or other property rights or interests, as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken, subject only to the surrender by him of the certificate, or certificates of such stock or other evidence of ownership or other property rights or interests.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> If within thirty (30) days after the date upon which the objecting member tendered his written demand for payment of his stock or other property rights or interest, the fair market value of such stock or other property rights or interests is agreed upon between the member and the surviving association, the payment therefor shall be made within sixty (60) days after the date of such agreement, upon surrender of the certificate or other evidence of such property rights or interests, whereupon the member shall cease to have any interest in such stock or other property rights or interest in the association.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(3)</b> If, during the thirty (30) day period mentioned in the preceding subsection, the member and the surviving association or new association do not agree as to the fair market value of such stock or other property rights or interests, the member may, within sixty (60) days thereafter, file a petition in the Circuit Court of the county in which the surviving association or new association has its registered office or principal place of business asking for the appointment of three (3) disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interests. A summons, together with a copy of the petition, shall be served on the surviving association or new association at least twenty (20) days prior to a hearing on the petition by the court. The award of the appraisers, or a majority of them, if no exceptions be filed thereto within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, shall be confirmed by the court, and when confirmed shall be final and conclusive, and the member, upon depositing with the court the proper stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests, shall be entitled to judgment against the association for the appraised value thereof as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken. If either party files exceptions to the award of the appraisers within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, the case shall be transferred to the civil issue docket of the Circuit Court for trial and shall be there tried in the same manner, as near as may be practicable, as is provided for the trial of cases under the eminent domain law of this state, and with the same right of appeal to the Court of Appeals. The court shall assess the cost of the proceedings as it deems equitable. Upon payment of the judgment, the surviving association or new association is entitled to have the member’s stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests surrendered to it by the clerk of the court. Unless the member files such a petition within the time prescribed, he, his assigns and heirs claiming under him shall have no right to payment hereunder, but in that event nothing herein shall impair his status as a member.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> The liability to pay for stock or other property rights or interests or to pay damages imposed by subsection (4) of this section on an association extends to the surviving association or new association.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> No member of a constituent association to be affected by a merger or consolidation, who objects thereto and makes written demand for payment of the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interests in the association, as provided in this section, is entitled to payment at any time prior to the time that he would otherwise be entitled to payment pursuant to valid provisions of such stock, or valid provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the association, in effect on the date of the vote for such merger or consolidation.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where its articles of incorporation allowed the corporation to sue and be sued, a voluntary fire department which was a nonprofit corporation, could sue a nonmember for a fee for fighting a fire. OAG 69-523.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislation granting state aid in the construction of an office building for the Kentucky municipal league would be constitutional. OAG 70-93.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A “big brothers” corporation is an institution of purely public charity and would be entitled to exemption from ad valorem property taxation under this section. OAG 77-411.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no reason why a rescue squad may not incorporate as a nonprofit corporation even though the rescue squad is funded primarily with city and county money. OAG 78-34.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no authority for the county judge/executive or fiscal court to prohibit or limit a volunteer fire department operating in the unincorporated part of a county, except that the fiscal court may enact ordinances pertaining to the reasonable regulation of such volunteer fire departments, pursuant to KRS 67.083(3) (u). OAG 79-569.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no authority of the county judge/executive or fiscal court to prohibit or limit rescue squads operating in the unincorporated portion of a county, except that the fiscal court, under KRS 67.083 (3) (d), has express authority to enact ordinances regarding the reasonable regulation of ambulance service in the unincorporated part of the county. OAG 79-569.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A county public hospital corporation which is formed as a nonprofit, nonstock corporation pursuant to KRS Chapter 273 is not a public agency which is subject to the Open Meeting Law ( KRS 61.805 — 61.850). OAG 82-1.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a county public hospital corporation being a corporation is not a public agency subject to the provisions of the statutes pertaining to conflict of interest, there is no statutory conflict of interest created by the employment of a law firm to represent the corporation in litigation while one of the members of the corporation’s board of commissioners is also a member of such law firm; such commissioner, however, should abstain from voting and absent himself from any meeting of the commission wherein the employment of his law firm is discussed or acted upon. OAG 82-1.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Kentucky Medical Services Foundation, Inc., is a nonprofit corporation organized under this chapter, receives no state or local funding, and therefore is not a public agency under the Kentucky Open Record Law, KRS 61.870 to 61.884. OAG 82-216.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Private, nonprofit, nonstock corporations are not public agencies and are therefore not subject to the Open Meetings law; thus, a nonprofit, nonstock corporation formed under KRS Ch. 273 for the purpose of local approval of loans for small businesses is not subject to the Open Meetings law. OAG 84-186.</p>

<p class="p7">(7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, both effective 7/15/2010. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together. Effective 1/1/2011, this section was also repealed and reenacted by the omnibus Kentucky Business Entity Filing Act, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assuming that the Kentucky River Foothills Development Council is a Community Action Corporation organized and functioning pursuant to KRS 273.410 to 273.453, and that it has been designated, pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of the fiscal court, as an agent of the county under KRS 273.435 for the implementation of various statutorily authorized public welfare projects, the fiscal court may appropriate public funds to such a Community Action Corporation in connection with the carrying out of such projects.

While Ky. Const., § 179 prohibits any county from appropriating money for any corporation, except for roads or bridges, this is no violation of § 179 as relates to county money expended under the community action agency legislation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A local county board of education would be sufficiently representative of the geographic area that it serves to qualify as an agency with which a community action agency could contract, and therefore, as long as the subject matter of the contract related to the purpose of promoting public education, a county board of education, on its part, could enter into a contract with a community action agency pursuant to KRS 160.160 and KRS 160.290.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to this section and KRS 273.410(2), any of the counties which have in legal effect designated a corporation as a community action agency may, subject to available funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS Chapter 68, contribute, through the corporation, county funds for any of the purposes described specifically in this section and KRS 273.410(2), with the assumption that such county grants are made by way of an agreement between the county and the corporation that such county money will be spent for a designated purpose or purposes, as expressly provided in this section and KRS 273.410(2), the corporation subsequently reporting to the county government the precise nature and amount of the final expenditure. While Ky. Const., § 179 prohibits any county from appropriating money for any corporation, except for roads or bridges, this is no violation of § 179 as relates to county money expended under the community action agency legislation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(6/24/2015). During codification of 2015 Ky. Acts ch. 34, Sec. 29 (this statute), the Reviser of Statutes has changed the word “corporation” to “association.” KRS Chapter 273A, dealing with unincorporated nonprofit associations, was created in that Act, and Section 29 of that Act was created as a new section of the new chapter. It is clear from the context that the reference to “corporation” in Section 29 of that Act was intended to be “association.” The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(1)</b> It shall be the policy of the General Assembly through this chapter to give maximum effect to the principles of freedom of contract and the enforceability of operating agreements. Unless displaced by particular provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity shall supplement this chapter. Although this chapter is in derogation of common law, the rules of construction that require strict construction of statutes which are in derogation of common law shall not apply to its provisions. This chapter shall not be construed to impair the obligations of any contract existing when this chapter, or any amendment of it, becomes effective, nor to affect any action or proceeding begun or right accrued before the chapter or amendment takes effect.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(2)</b> A written operating agreement may provide that the limited liability company interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that the member is obligated to make or who otherwise violates an obligation undertaken in the operating agreement shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Reducing or eliminating the defaulting member’s proportionate interest in the limited liability company;</p>

<p class="p7"><b>(4)</b> Except to the extent set forth in a written operating agreement, a limited liability company is bound by and a party to the operating agreement.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(5)</b> Action validly taken pursuant to one (1) provision of this chapter shall not be deemed invalid solely because it is identical or similar in substance to an action that could have been taken pursuant to some other provision of this chapter but fails to satisfy one (1) or more requirements prescribed by such other provision.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(6)</b> No member or other person shall have a vested property right resulting from any provision of the operating agreement which may not be modified by its amendment or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(7)</b> Each member and manager and any other party to an operating agreement shall discharge all duties and exercise all rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The obligation of good faith and fair dealing may not be eliminated in the operating agreement, but it may prescribe the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured provided the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>(8)</b> To the extent the articles of organization and the operating agreement do not otherwise provide, the Kentucky Limited Liability Company Act shall govern relations among the limited liability company, the members, the managers, and the assignees.</p>

<p class="p7">(7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together.</p>
